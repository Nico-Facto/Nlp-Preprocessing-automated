",Davos financial players pump US$1.4 trillion into fossil fuels: new Greenpeace report,Bank of America ,United States,,,,"
January 21 2020, Davos, Switzerland


Banks and pension funds with CEOs attending the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos are collectively financially exposed to fossil fuel companies to the tune of US$1.4 trillion. Also represented at the gathering of the world’s most powerful are five of the worst insurance companies for coal coverage. These are the findings of “It’s the finance sector, stupid,” a new Greenpeace International report. 
Greenpeace International analysed which banks, pension funds and insurers go to Davos but fail to live up to the Forum’s goal, from an environmental and economic perspective, of “improving the state of the world.” The report and accompanying website, www.worldeconomicfailure.com, also illustrate how lobbyists and PR firms are engaged by these financial actors and fossil fuel companies to work against the Paris Agreement.


“The banks, insurers and pension funds here at Davos are culpable for the climate emergency. Despite environmental and economic warnings, they’re fuelling another global financial crisis by propping up the fossil fuel industry. These money men at Davos are nothing short of hypocrites as they say they want to save the planet but are actually killing it for short term profit,” said Greenpeace International Executive Director, Jennifer Morgan.


24 banks that go to Davos have financed the fossil fuel industry to the amount of US$1.4 trillion since the Paris Agreement through to 2018.(1) US$1.4 trillion is the same as what the world’s 3.8 billion poorest people had collectively in 2018.


Of these 24, it is just 10 banks that account for US$1 trillion in fossil fuel finance: JP Morgan Chase, Citi, Bank of America, RBC Royal Bank, Barclays, MUFG, TD Bank, Scotiabank, Mizuho and Morgan Stanley. US$1 trillion is equivalent to the financial risk reported by 215 of the world’s biggest global companies due to climate impacts that are likely to hit within the next five years. US$1 trillion could also buy 640GW of solar power, which is more than the current global capacity.


Three pension funds that are due this year at Davos have at least US$26 billion in fossil fuel holdings in Shell, Chevron and Exxon, among others, and in fossil fuel bankers JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Royal Bank of Canada.(2) US$26 billion equates to the world’s biggest IPO to date, that of Saudi Aramco. These three pension funds are Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and PensionDanmark. 


If a sector is not insurable, it is not bankable. Five of the world’s worst insurance providers when it comes to covering coal attended the 2019 Annual Meeting in Davos and are likely to be there this year. They are AIG, Prudential, Sompo, Tokio Marine and Lloyd’s.(3) Four of the five have not adopted any public policies to reduce their support for coal projects.(4) And the same number has not adopted any public policies to divest from coal and other fossil fuels.(5) AIG, sponsor of New Zealand’s national rugby union team, is deemed as the worst insurer as it also has not excluded support for the giant Adani coal mine project in Australia.


“The time for talking shops and PR spin is over. The regulators must do their jobs before it is too late and financial actors must stop operating as if it’s business as usual. We are in a climate emergency and there will be no money on a dead planet,” said Morgan.

Notes to Editors

Since the Paris Agreement was signed, 33 major global banks have collectively poured US$1.9 trillion into fossil fuels, according to BankTrack’s report, Banking on Climate Change – Fossil Fuel Finance Report Card 2019. 24 of these banks attended the World Economic Forum’s 2019 Annual Meeting in Davos, based on Quartz data, and are likely to attend this year’s event in Davos. These 24 banks have funded fossil fuels to the tune of US$1.4 trillion since the adoption of the Paris climate accord in 2015 and up to the end of 2018, according to BankTrack. The 24 banks are: JP Morgan Chase, Citi, Bank of America, RBC Royal Bank, Barclays, MUFG, TD Bank, Scotiabank, Mizuho, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Credit Suisse, Bank of Montreal, Deutsche Bank, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce(CIBC), Société Générale, UBS, ING, BPCE/Natixis, Standard Chartered, Santander, BBVA and Royal Bank of Scotland(RBS).
The US$26bn figure for the 3 pension funds is based on Greenpeace International calculations via desk research into the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and PensionDanmark. These pension funds attended the World Economic Forum’s 2019 Annual Meeting in Davos, based on Quartz data, and are likely to attend this year’s event in Davos
The UnfriendCoal scorecard 2019 focused on 30 leading insurers, assessing and scoring their policies on coal and tar sands insurance, divestment and other aspects of climate leadership on the basis of a survey with more than 80 questions. Of the 30 companies, 24 responded to the survey or provided other information. Those that did not respond were scored on the basis of publicly available information. 5 of these insurers attended the World Economic Forum’s 2019 Annual Meeting in Davos, based on Quartz data, and are likely to attend this year’s event in Davos.
AIG, Sompo, Tokio Marine and Llyod’s have not adopted any public policies to reduce their support for coal projects.
AIG, Prudential, Sompo and Tokio Marine have not adopted any public policies to divest from coal and other fossil fuels.



Prediction of 2020 Davos attendees is based on the Quartz magazine’s lists of Davos attendees between 2016-2019.

Amsterdam ","Friends of the Earth groups complaint against ING Group admissible, declares OECD",ING ,Netherlands,Socfin ,agriculture - non-food crops | agriculture - palm oil ,Luxembourg,"
AMSTERDAM, 20 January 2020 - The Dutch National Contact Point for the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) today declared a complaint from three Friends of the Earth groups (Milieudefensie (Netherlands), SDI (Liberia) and WALHI (Indonesia)) against Dutch bank ING admissible. This complaint is unique in that for the first time a company is accused of ‘contributing to’ rather than being merely ‘linked to’ wrongdoing. The complaint is supported by several other international organizations ReAct, Fian Belgium, Brot für alle, FERN and CNCD-11.11.11.
Anne Wijers, from Friends of the Earth Netherlands, “ING has been ignoring abuses in the palm oil sector for years. For decades we’ve been alerting ING to concrete examples of abuses by the palm oil companies they finance. During this time abuses on the ground have continued unabated and ING continues financing these companies. So we have reached the point where it’s fair to say ING are complicit in the abuses.”
The Indonesian environmental organization WALHI (Friends of the Earth Indonesia) and the Liberian Sustainable Development Institute SDI (Friends of the Earth Liberia) are co-complainants. James Otto from SDI says, “We're confronted with these abuses every day. Local people are robbed of their income and do not get work as promised on plantations. People who do work there are injured, being exploited and live in miserable conditions.”
Oslan Purba, from WALHI recognizes the abuses described by Otto and highlights that deforestation and land grabbing are systemic in the palm oil sector, “What matters to us is that we have been presenting case after case for 20 years, yet European financial institutions continue financing palm oil companies. Dutch banks are seen as pioneers in the field of sustainability and human rights, but in practice we do not see them effectively encouraging the companies they work with to improve their behavior.”  
Although the complaint from the three organizations can be read as an anthology of abuses, they reveal a much larger, underlying problem, “ING’s CSR policy is merely a paper tiger. Their policy is to avoid such abuses. But this is not the reality: reported abuses persist for a long time or are not solved at all. This complaint demonstrates once again that we need binding legislation for financial institutions to put an end to dubious investments,"" Milieudefensie’s Anne Wijers says.
WALHI, SDI and Milieudefensie have asked the OECD Dutch National Contact Point (NCP) to mediate and, if necessary, decide if ING is adhering to its own CSR policy. The organizations are particularly critical of ING because of its lack of awareness of existing abuses, underestimation of the extent of known abuses and inability to resolve them adequately. The organizations are also asking the OECD to clarify the conditions under which ING can be held responsible for the actions of companies they work with, the impact of their abuses and in what way ING should meaningfully contribute to remedies. The NCP is unlikely to make a final ruling on the complaint until spring 2021. Until then, the process will take place behind closed doors.

",Dozens take action at JPMorgan healthcare conference,JPMorgan Chase ,United States,,,,"
San Francisco –– A coalition of dozens of activists and community leaders rallied at the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference to hold the world’s worst funder of fossil fuels, JPMorgan Chase, accountable for its financing practices. The rally comes just one business day following the launch of Stop the Money Pipeline, a major new activist effort going after the financial industry’s funding of climate destruction. 
The action, led by Indigenous community leaders, entailed a round dance as demonstrators chanted: “Chase. If you really cared, you’d protect our water, land and air,” and “Defund climate change. Stop Funding Fossil Fuels!” 
“The evidence is overwhelming. Climate change is the world’s biggest threat to human health.” said Ethan Nuss, Senior Organizer at Rainforest Action Network. “If JPMorgan Chase wants to position itself as a champion of healthcare, it must act decisively and stop funding fossil fuel expansion.”
Chase Bank is one of the three main targets for the Stop the Money Pipeline because of the bank’s outsized role in financing fossil fuel development. Since the Paris Agreement, Chase has provided $196 billion in finance for fossil fuels, 10% of all fossil fuel finance from the 33 major global banks. By funding the companies behind major fossil fuel infrastructure projects like Enbridge’s Line 3 and Coastal Gaslink pipelines, Chase is violating the right to Free, Prior and Informed Consent of Indigenous peoples. 
“JPMorgan Chase is continuing a legacy of environmental health damages and abuses of Indigenous rights,” said Nina Berglund, Northern Cheyenne and Oglala, and member of the 13 “Youth Climate Intervenors.” “For the sake of coming generations, we must stop the catastrophe that is Enbridge’s Line 3 pipeline in its tracks, and to do this, we must stop the money pipeline.”

",Shareholder resolution at Barclays puts climate crisis centre stage for European banking sector in 2020,Barclays ,United Kingdom,,,,"
Today a group of shareholders, coordinated by ShareAction, have taken formal action at Barclays, asking the bank to phase out its financing of fossil fuel companies that are active agents in driving the climate crisis. 
11 institutional investors managing over GBP130 billion including Brunel Pension Partnership, LGPS Central, Sarasin & Partners and Folksam Investors have filed a shareholder resolution at Barclays alongside over 100 individual shareholders, led by ShareAction, the responsible investment charity. It will be voted on by investors at Barclays’ annual general meeting in May 2020.  
This landmark resolution – the first climate change resolution filed at a European bank – requests that Barclays publishes a plan to gradually stop the provision of financial services (including project finance, corporate finance, and underwriting) to companies in the energy sector, and to gas and electric utilities that are not aligned with the goals of the Paris climate agreement. 
Since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015, Barclays has provided more than USD85 billion of finance to fossil fuel companies and high-carbon projects such as tar sands and Arctic oil and gas. This makes it the world’s sixth largest backer of fossil fuels, and constitutes the highest level of fossil fuel financing of any European bank, exceeding its peers by over USD27 billion. 
In May 2019 a group of Barclays’ investors backed a letter from ShareAction to the bank asking it to stop funding companies involved in coal mining or oil sands exploitation. 
The proposal also encourages Barclays to consider the social dimension of the transition to a resilient and low-carbon economy, as per the Paris Agreement. This makes it the first climate change resolution to include a so-called ‘just transition’ ask in its supporting statement. Investors representing more than USD5 trillion have already expressed support for the just transition.  
This resolution represents a significant opportunity for Barclays to bring its lending practices in line with global climate ambition and play an active role in accelerating the low-carbon transition.  
The resolution is the first in a series of actions in 2020, which will put financial services to the test on climate change in the run up to the UK-hosted COP26 climate talks. 
Shareholders filing the resolution have signalled their hope that Barclays board will choose to respond positively by recommending a vote in favour at May’s AGM. 
Jeanne Martin, Campaign Manager at ShareAction, says: “The message is clear: piecemeal changes in energy policy will no longer cut it. For too long, minor policy improvements have provided cover for the banking sector, while failing to halt fossil fuel financing. We know what needs to happen. Banks must align their lending with the science. If Barclays supports the Paris Agreement, it will support this resolution.” 
Laura Chappell, CEO of Brunel Pension Partnership, which manages GBP30 billion, says: “Brunel Pension Partnership Limited (Brunel) believes climate change poses significant risks to global financial stability and could thereby create climate-related financial risks to our own business operations, portfolios and client partner funds, unless action is taken to mitigate these risks.”  
“We believe that it is crucial for investors to carry out climate change risk assessments across the whole financial chain. As banks are the biggest lenders, they are a key component of this. The lending practices of many banks poses a serious threat to the goals to the Paris agreement. As such, we welcome ShareAction’s call to the world’s largest banks to integrate climate change risk assessment and to set and disclose adequate phase-out targets in response. We hope the Barclays Board formally supports this resolution.” 
Natasha Landell-Mills, CFA, Partner, Head of Stewardship at Sarasin & Partners, which manages over GBP14 billion, says: “Aligning financial flows with the goal of keeping temperature increases well below 2C, and preferably to 1.5C, was hard-wired into the Paris Climate Agreement for good reason. Continued financing of harmful fossil fuel activities puts this target at risk, with potentially devastating consequences for us all. And yet, this is precisely what is happening today, and Barclays is amongst the most prolific bank financiers globally of such activities.  
“It is therefore vital that Barclays’ Board ensures that it no longer supports – whether through direct lending or underwriting – any activities that run contrary to the Paris Agreement. Failure to act leaves directors open to charges that they have failed to meet their obligations under the UK Companies Act. It also exposes the bank and its shareholders to heightened capital risks as decarbonisation accelerates. At a time of economic uncertainty, the Board should not be taking on additional risks.”
Julian Corner, CEO of Lankelly Chase, which manages GBP153 million, says: “Time is running out to prevent global heating of 1.5c above pre-industrial levels, with catastrophic consequences, and it is now imperative that financing for fossil fuels must stop. We therefore urge the Barclays Board and our fellow shareholders to support this resolution at the AGM. Unless Barclays can demonstrate alignment with the Paris Agreement, it can no longer have a place in the portfolios of any responsible investor.” 
Stephen Power of the Jesuits in Britain, which manages GBP531 million, says: “Climate change is the most pressing challenge the world faces. The Jesuits in Britain support the resolution to align Barclays with other banks taking steps to meet Paris targets, both in response to the increasing scientific evidence that effects of climate change are accelerating and for reasons of sound business sense. The scale of the challenge means large global banks should do all they can to help avert the severe financial risks that could result from a failure to meet the Paris goals. The resolution seeks to ensure that major energy sector companies take the Paris targets seriously but also that the finance and banking sector do not allow deviation from them.” 
Annette Lanjouw, Chief Executive Officer of the Arcus Foundation, says: “The climate crisis is an existential threat to all people, non-human animals and habitats – to life as we know it. Financial institutions and investors have the power to mitigate this threat in an impactful way with more conscious, disciplined investing as specified in this resolution. Our hope is that Barclay’s bank will set an example that others will follow and build momentum toward a reversal of the unnecessary and life-threatening decline in the world’s biodiversity.” 
Danielle Fugere, President of shareholder representative As You Sow, says: “Shareholders are asking Barclays to immediately begin reducing its funding to the projects and companies that are causing catastrophic global warming and increasing risk to people, the planet, and investors’ portfolios. This is not a chicken–and–egg situation; we cannot realistically expect change from high emitters while unfettered funds continue to flow to them. Hard decisions are called for by both companies and banks and we hope that Barclays joins other global banks in signaling dramatic change by aligning its funding decisions with the Paris Agreement’s goal of maintaining global temperature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius.” 
Given the systemic threats posed by climate change, and the rising regulatory scrutiny of banks’ resilience to accelerated decarbonisation and climatic impacts, this resolution supports the long-term economic interest of shareholders. 
While the implementation of the resolution would be a matter for the Board of the company, the co-filers of this resolution expect disclosure on the criteria and processes Barclays puts in place for determining whether a borrower is meeting Paris Agreement targets.

Notes to editors: 

The full text of the resolution and supporting statement can be sent on request. 
The 11 institutional investors who co-filed this resolution are the following: Arcus Foundation, As You Sow, Brunel Pension Partnership, the Central Board of the Methodist Church, Falkirk Council Pension Fund, Folksam, Jesuits in Britain, Lankelly Chase, LGPS Central, Merseyside Pension Fund, and Sarasin & Partners.
The Association of Ethical Shareholders Germany, a co-filer of the resolution, manages the voting rights of 1000 retail shareholders. 
Barclays’ board will issue its voting recommendation on this resolution in its notice for the annual general meeting.  
Barclays’ European peers have already started taking more ambitious steps to align their energy financing with the Paris goals. For example:
– Crédit Agricole committed to fully phase out its exposure to the coal industry by 2030 for EU and OECD countries; 2040 for China; 2050 for the rest of the world.
– BNP Paribas committed to no longer do business with companies focused on oil and gas from tar sands. BNP Paribas will also no longer finance projects that are mainly involved in the transportation and export of oil and gas from tar sands.
– Standard Chartered committed not to provide new financial services to new projects or developments that involve the extraction and construction of associated export facilities from tar sands, the exploration or production of oil and gas in the Amazon basin, and the exploration or production of oil and gas in the Arctic region.
About ShareAction: ShareAction exists to make the global investment sector responsible for its impacts, while mobilising its power to address the challenges we face. The potential for shifting capital markets towards positive outcomes is huge, but major financial institutions are currently failing to drive the level of change we need to create a green, fair, and healthy society. We want a future where all finance powers social progress and since 2005, we’ve developed a powerful toolkit of research, campaigns, policy advocacy and public mobilisation to drive change in and through the finance system. We are working to create a system in which: 
Major financial institutions take responsibility for their impacts on people and planet  
Investors and the companies they invest in operate within safe ecological limits  
Investors and the companies they invest in sustain fair, just and healthy societies, and 
The investment system is diverse and inclusive at all levels.

",BankTrack's 2019 highlights,,,,,,"
As we approach the end of 2019 and head into a new decade, it's time to take a moment to reflect on the year gone by and consider the challenges to come. We've compiled ten of our 2019 highlights below, to celebrate what we’ve achieved this year, as always working closely together with many allies around the world. While we're proud of these achievements, the challenges we all face for 2020 feel immense.


The next decade, and the next few years in particular, are make-or-break for climate change, as we know from the UN's Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C. Yet, despite 25 years of talks under the UN climate umbrella, there is still no sign of emissions peaking. Worse, 2019 has seen nationalist movements that are often hostile to climate science consolidate their power in many countries, and the Madrid Climate Conference did not see countries dramatically scaling up their ambition. There are sources of hope, like the growing youth-led movement for climate justice, but the window for action is closing.


A large part of the banking sector's answer this year was the launch of the Principles for Responsible Banking (PRBs), which together with the new version of the Equator Principles formed major 2019 landmarks on the financial landscape. The commitments in the PRBs are welcome, particularly the headline commitment for banks to align their business models with the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals – but with PRB banks like Citi and Credit Suisse prepared to support deals like the Saudi Aramco IPO and ICBC remaining the world’s number one financier of coal power expansion companies, this UN-sponsored initiative looks so far like yet another green smokescreen. And despite the massive and sustained effort that BankTrack led to influence the new Equator Principles, the result fell short of a robust response to the unfolding climate crisis – far short.


If sector-wide initiatives are not cutting it, some banks are making encouraging moves on their own. The trend towards more and stronger coal exclusions continued in 2019 and have begun to be extended to other fossil fuels like Arctic oil. There were two high-profile examples just this week from Goldman Sachs and Standard Chartered. Banks will need to step up the scale of these efforts dramatically in the year to come.


For BankTrack, 2019 was first and foremost about spreading the message of our Fossil Banks, No Thanks! campaign – that it is time for banks to move beyond coal and realise that finance for all new fossil fuel projects has to come to an end, and soon. In November, the European Investment Bank led the way for publicly owned multilateral banks with its rapidly achieved and almost total pull out of fossil fuel finance. So which of the big commercial banks will lead the way for the private sector?


Next year’s UN climate conference in Glasgow will focus on a global stock-take and further strengthening of climate commitments, and we'll be making sure that the banking sector commits to do its part by starting to phase out fossil fuel financing in earnest. Between now and next November, we will be taking the case to banks with all of the urgency that the situation and the science demands.


With best wishes for the new year ahead,

The BankTrack team (Johan, Greig, Raymon, Erik, Naomi, Daisy and Ryan).

 
New research shows rising fossil fuel finance
The Fossil Fuel Finance Report Card 2019, released in March by BankTrack and allies, revealed that 33 global banks have provided USD 1.9 trillion to fossil fuel companies since the adoption of the Paris climate accord in 2015. The amount of financing has risen in each of the past two years. The research has been a powerful driver of subsequent campaigning, even being referenced by Greta Thunberg at the recent UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid.
The myth of client confidentiality exposed
Also in March we published an analysis of five years of correspondence with 31 major international banks on problematic projects they finance, and found that in nearly half of all responses banks said they could not comment on whether they had a relationship with a particular customer or project. Banks were urged to write the right to disclose client relationships into their contracts, particularly for high risk deals.
Bringing the ""Fossil Banks, No Thanks!"" message to AGM season
From April to June, as part of our global Fossil Banks, No Thanks! campaign, BankTrack was present inside and outside 17 bank annual general meetings in nine countries, urging banks to commit to end financing for the fossil fuels industry. We were joined by campaigners and activists from at least 25 other organisations. See our summary here.
Civil society reacts to Principles for Responsible Banking
As the Principles for Responsible Banking were launched in September we welcomed the initiative but expressed significant reservations about what these new principles are going to concretely deliver for people and planet. We will be keeping close watch, and judging the initiative on its results. Our Director Johan Frijns was also present at the launch, and intervened to call on the banks to address the 'big F-words', fossil fuels.
New OECD guidance for bank lending and underwriting
In October, the OECD released new guidance on responsible lending and underwriting for banks, after an extensive multi-stakeholder process which BankTrack joined. As we outlined in an analysis of the paper with OECD Watch, the guidance marked a step forward in the international normative framework that aims to encourage responsible conduct by banks and others in the financial sector.
50 banks benchmarked on Human Rights 
In November, BankTrack published its third Human Rights Benchmark. It showed that most banks are still failing on human rights nearly a decade after new UN principles were established to guide their behaviour. The report ranks 50 commercial banks from leaders to laggards according to their efforts to uphold human rights.
Banks warned on Saudi Aramco IPO 
In November we joined a coalition of environmental groups to warn banks to stay away from organising a massive share offering for the world’s largest corporate emitter of carbon dioxide, Saudi Aramco. Banks’ willingness to raise billions of dollars for a state-owned Saudi company was also criticised, given the Kingdom’s horrendous record on human rights. The IPO went ahead, but foreign investors stayed away.
Over 300 civil society groups call on Equator Principles to act with courage 
Also in November, BankTrack led a passionate call from 325 civil society groups from 58 countries for Equator banks to ‘act with courage and ambition’ and take bold action on climate change and human rights. We gave it our best shot, but the Equator Principles Association opted for continuing with business as usual.
We assess the world's largest banks' fossil finance policies for COP 25
In December we assessed where banks stand on fossil fuels, finding that none of the world’s largest banks have policies and timelines in place to phase out their financing for the fossil fuel industry as a whole, despite ever more urgent calls for decisive action on the climate emergency.
We reveal the top financiers of new coal power development
Also in December, BankTrack, urgewald and other partner NGOs published new research identifying the top financiers and investors behind the expansion of the world’s coal plant fleet. Over the past 3 years, financial institutions have channeled USD 745 billion to companies planning new coalpower plants.

London, UK ",Standard Chartered announces exit from three coal plant projects and phase-out of corporate support for coal ,Standard Chartered ,United Kingdom,National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) ,energy plants - coal | energy plants - hydro  | energy plants - renewables | manufacturing | mining - coal ,India,"
Today Standard Chartered has announced that it will withdraw from the lending consortia for three new coal-fired power plant projects. The move was applauded by NGOs which have been calling on the London and Hong Kong-headquartered bank to do so since it introduced a prohibition on direct financing for new coal-fired power plants in September 2018, yet chose to remain in the three projects, two of which are located in Vietnam. 1
Standard Chartered’s announcement also includes a new coal phase-out commitment covering all financial products and services which should see the bank ending its support for thermal coal dependent companies by 2030. With this policy revision, Standard Chartered becomes the most advanced major UK-based bank in terms of explicitly restricting general corporate support to coal clients.
However, the interim restriction targets the bank has set between 2021 and 2030 are noticeably weaker than those introduced by various other European banks which have chosen to clamp down more firmly and rapidly on the industry most responsible for driving climate change. 2
Bernadette Maheandiran, Legal Analyst at Market Forces in Australia, said:
“Standard Chartered has made a welcome decision to close the loopholes in its policy by pulling out of the lending consortia for three new coal-fired power stations in Southeast Asia.
""The controversial and polluting Vung Ang 2 and Vinh Tan 3 projects in Vietnam continue to stand in the way of Asia's path to clean energy, breathable air and a safe climate. Standard Chartered's move should send a signal to other banks, including DBS, MUFG, Mizuho and SMBC, that building coal is financially risky, environmentally and socially unsound and morally reprehensible.”
Research published earlier this month by BankTrack, urgewald and 350.org revealed that over the last three years Standard Chartered has been the biggest UK bank supporter of companies actively planning to develop new coal plants.  The bank’s $8.56 billion support for these companies, including some of the world’s most aggressive coal power expansion companies, has predominantly been done via general corporate lending and the provision of underwriting services. 
Greig Aitken, Climate campaigner at BankTrack, said:
“Hats off to Standard Chartered for making these new commitments which underscore once again that the coal industry is on its last legs. The bank’s decision to get out of the coal plant projects in Vietnam will be a boon to local communities and campaigners who are fighting hard to resist deeply unpopular coal. The other banks still involved in the financing of these projects must follow Standard Chartered’s example by changing course and acting responsibly in the face of an industry desperately hanging on for life support.
“It’s also encouraging to see Standard Chartered move the needle in the context of the UK banking sector’s still rampant appetite for profit-making off coal. In the last three years as the climate crisis has intensified, Standard Chartered, HSBC and Barclays have provided and facilitated over $20 billion between them for coal expansion companies such as NTPC of India and PLN Persero of Indonesia. 
“Standard Chartered’s new restrictions on coal, while they don’t go deep and fast enough, do however start to address the real problem behind the UK’s dirty coal secret, corporate-level financial support. The UK’s big three banks now have 11 months before the UN climate conference in Glasgow to get their houses properly free of coal.”   
Notes for editors:
1. See information on the Vung Ang 2 and Vinh Tan 3 coal plant projects in Vietnam, two BankTrack ‘Dodgy Deals’. Standard Chartered has not clarified to NGOs the identity of the third coal plant project. 
2. The updated Standard Chartered approach to fossil fuel power is available here. The bank states:


“We will only provide financial services to clients who:
·       By 2021, are less than 100% dependent on thermal coal (based on % EBITDA at group level);
·       By 2025, are less than 60% dependent on thermal coal (based on % EBITDA at group level);
·       By 2027, are less than 40% dependent on thermal coal (based on % EBITDA at group level);
·       By 2030, are less than 10% dependent on thermal coal (based on % EBITDA at group level).”

San Francisco ",Goldman Sachs adopts strongest fossil finance policy by a major US Bank,Goldman Sachs ,United States,,,,"
Today, Goldman Sachs announced the strongest fossil finance restrictions of any major U.S. bank, though it still lags behind its leading global competitors. It also remains far from alignment with what is needed to limit climate change to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
Goldman Sachs has ruled out direct finance for new or expanding thermal coal mines and coal-fired power plant projects worldwide, as well as direct finance for new Arctic oil exploration and production. The policy makes explicit mention of protecting the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The bank has also committed to a phase out of financing for significant thermal coal mining companies that do not have a diversification strategy.
With this policy revision, Goldman Sachs becomes the first major U.S. bank to establish explicit restrictions on financing for any part of the oil and gas sector. It is also the first major U.S. bank to rule out direct finance for thermal coal mines and plants worldwide. This is a crucial step forward, as other U.S. bank coal finance restrictions have geographic loopholes.
While other major U.S. banks have committed to reducing credit exposure to coal mining, their approach restricts only lending, ignoring the large amounts of capital the banks facilitate for the coal industry from the underwriting of issuances of stocks and bonds. Goldman Sachs’s new policy tightens the screw on thermal coal by (1) including underwriting, and (2) explicitly committing to phase-out, not just reduction.
Jason Opeña Disterhoft, Climate and Energy Senior Campaigner at Rainforest Action Network (RAN), issued the following statement on RAN’s behalf.
“By ruling out direct finance for Arctic oil exploration and production, Goldman has established the first no-go zone for a major U.S. bank in the oil and gas sector. Goldman Sachs’s updated policy shows that U.S. banks can draw red lines on oil and gas, and now other major U.S. banks, especially JPMorgan Chase –– the world’s worst banker of fossil fuels by a wide margin –– must improve on what Goldman has done.
“The writing was already on the wall for coal financing. Goldman Sachs’s new policy puts that writing in flashing neon. A commitment from what is considered by its peers as the most prestigious investment bank on Wall Street to exit financing for thermal coal mining companies will accelerate coal becoming completely unbankable.
“This new policy from Goldman Sachs raises the bar for other U.S. banks if they want to be taken seriously on climate change. The policy comes after years of work from RAN and many others to highlight the role of Goldman Sachs and other banks in causing climate change through the hundreds of billions of dollars they pour into the fossil fuel industry.
“The prohibition on financing the oil industry’s desecration of the Arctic Refuge is due to tireless Indigenous-led resistance, including crucial advocacy by the Gwich’in Steering Committee.
“Major U.S. banks have been grossly lagging behind their global peers in restricting fossil fuel finance: European banks have the strongest policies, and Asian banks have been making the most rapid recent progress. Going forward, Goldman Sachs must continue strengthening its fossil finance policy, but for now it has shown that U.S. banks can start to close the fossil policy gap. Now it’s time for its Wall Street peers to step up.
“The smart money on Wall Street is drawing red lines on oil and gas, and exiting coal. The big money has to respond, or it will be left holding the bag. Over to you, Jamie Dimon and JPMorgan Chase.”

Madrid ",Banks warned that deficient fossil fuel policies are accelerating climate crisis,,,,,,"
After climate activist Greta Thunberg used her speech at the COP25 Climate Conference to highlight the role of banks in financing the climate crisis, a new assessment by BankTrack released today reveals that none of the world’s largest bank fossil fuel financiers have policies and timelines in place to phase out their financing for the fossil fuel industry (coal, oil and gas), despite ever more urgent calls for decisive action on the climate emergency.
While the 25th UN Climate Summit (COP25) takes place in Madrid, BankTrack has written to 38 banks to warn them that their policies on fossil fuel finance are still on track to help accelerate the climate crisis. The letters were sent in a week that has seen ever expanding bushfires in Australia and alarming reports on a sevenfold increase in ice loss over Greenland, with ever more parties calling for drastic action to avoid further catastrophe. 1
Scientists have made clear that meeting the Paris climate goals requires that little or no new CO2-emitting infrastructure can be built, a fact recognised by the International Energy Agency. Yet, while many banks committed this year to align their business strategies in order to be consistent with these goals, no banks have yet followed through on this with a commitment to stop financing all new fossil fuel projects.  
The assessment from BankTrack, which leads the 'Fossil Banks, No Thanks!' campaign, shows that a majority of the 38 banks now partially exclude new finance for coal power or mining, but only five have plans in place for phasing out their existing support for the coal sector. Crédit Agricole is the clear leader on coal, with its commitment made in June this year to end all coal finance in Europe and OECD countries by 2030 and the rest of the world by 2040, and its immediate end to financing for coal plant developers.

Thirteen banks have ended financing for some types of oil projects, such as those involving drilling in the Arctic, and nine have ended financing for some types of gas projects including fracking for shale gas. Italian bank UniCredit, which was until recently a laggard among European banks, has now excluded direct finance across a number of oil and gas sectors, including fracking for shale gas, ultradeep-water oil and gas, and liquefied natural gas. 
None of the large commercial banks, though, have yet followed the benchmark set by the European Investment Bank (EIB), which committed in November to no longer finance any unabated fossil fuel projects by the end of 2021. The new EIB policy covers not just coal but also oil and gas, making it the first such policy of its kind. 
Johan Frijns, director of BankTrack, said:  “The UN Secretary General, central bankers and thousands of scientists are using ever more alarming language to call for decisive action to tackle the climate emergency. Banks must heed the call and act accordingly. The most important immediate action they can take is to swiftly bring their fossil finance to zero.  As long as fossil fuels continue to be dug up and burned with bank support, every penny they put towards renewable energy will be undermined.”
Greig Aitken, Climate campaigner for BankTrack, said: “COP26 next year in Glasgow will be the stock-taking year for the parties to the Paris Agreement. Starting from now, banks should also take stock of how to massively scale up their climate action and end their support for fossil fuels.”

",New letter from 30 organisations urges investors and banks to note major risks of exposure to Amazon deforestation of buying shares in global meatpackers JBS and Marfrig,BNDES ,Brazil,,,,"
 A new letter from 30 civil society organisations across the globe is urging investors and banks to think twice before buying new JBS and Marfrig shares, both of which may soon be placed on the market.
Read the full letter here.
JBS and Marfrig, two of the world’s largest beef traders operating in Brazil, have been linked multiple times to deforestation of the climate-critical Amazon forest, which in the last 12 months experienced raging fires and rapidly increasing rates of deforestation.
The letter comes as reports emerge that BNDES plans to sell shares it holds in both companies in either December 2019 or early 2020.
It highlights various allegations of JBS and Marfrig’s links to worrying deforestation. It also points out that an unknown, but likely significant, portion of their Amazon cattle purchases are not audited – raising questions of how investors can do their due diligence into the company without this information, and ensure their financing is not exposed to deforestation.
“Over the last 12 months, an area of forest equivalent to over six times the size of London was destroyed, a 30% increase over the previous year,” signatories write. “This alarming rise in the destruction of the Amazon has intensified under the Bolsonaro Government, undermining global commitments and efforts to address the current climate crisis.” 
They also point to claims from the Federal Prosecutors Office in Brazil, which stated that “no company that currently purchases from the Amazon can say that their supply chain is deforestation free.”
The letter calls on investors and financial service providers to withhold additional share purchases in JBS and Marfrig until they can accurately assess each company’s legal compliance and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risks.
With groups such as Amazon Watch, BankTrack, Global Witness and Greenpeace Brazil already signed up to the letter, more are expected to add their names in the coming days. You can see the full letter with signatories here.
The signatories not only include organisations who work on forest protection internationally and within Brazil, but also those who look to fight the huge human cost of deforestation, including attacks against Land and Environment Defenders and indigenous communities – who are disproportionately impacted by forest destruction and land grabs linked to deforestation and the cattle sector. 
Significantly, the call follows a recent statement from 244 investors in September asking companies exposed to deforestation to act urgently to save the Amazon. And it follows a Global Witness investigation revealing how more than 300 banks and investors backed six of the world’s most harmful agribusinesses to the tune of $44bn.
Both JBS and Marfrig denied the allegations linking them to deforestation, claiming they have systems in place that screen out purchasing cattle from ranches where deforestation has occurred and which are verified by independent audits – fuller responses by the companies to these allegations can be seen in the open letter linked here.
Shona Hawkes, Senior Global Policy Adviser, Global Witness said:
“Just three short months ago, investors really put themselves out there by showing a new commitment to use their power for the common good – using their collective voice to call for an end to the rapidly escalating destruction of the Brazilian Amazon.
“This new potential sale of shares in JBS and Marfrig – companies accused of multiple links to Amazon deforestation – will be the first real test of that investor commitment.
“Either banks and financiers act to stop money flowing into the destruction of a forest vital for halting climate breakdown, or they don’t. Whether they choose to facilitate the purchase of these shares, or cash in on them themselves, the role of our financial institutions here is key.”
The spokesperson from Global Witness also pointed out that allegations of irregular practices involving investments in JBS by BNDES had not gone unnoticed by official bodies, exposing potential investors in JBS’s shares to these risks. In October 2019, a Parliamentary Inquiry of Brazil’s Chamber of Deputies released a report on illicit practices of BNDES’s past financing of various companies, including allegations of irregularities in its financial dealings with JBS between 2005 and 2014.
In a statement made in 2017 on JBS’s financial relationship with BNDES, the company denied “that there was any favouritism in the operations made by BNDES’s subsidiary, BNDESPar, and that these were carried out according to the rules of capital markets in Brazil.”
Hawkes also pointed to the role governments, particularly in the UK, France and US, play in regulating their financial systems to ensure that rapid investment in environmentally damaging projects is ended.
“Mandatory due diligence is crucial here,” she said, “it must be put in place for all financiers, banks, investors and companies that might end up intentionally or otherwise fuelling environmental destruction and human rights abuses.”

",Major banks complicit in financing Indonesia’s illegal fire and haze crisis: report,Bank Central Asia ,Indonesia,,,,"
A new report released by Rainforest Action Network, TuK Indonesia, WALHI, Jikalahari and Profundo reviews the progress of Indonesia’s Sustainable Finance reforms over the past 5 years. It shows that while new standards have started to improve the requirements on banks to disclose Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risks in their portfolios, major loopholes remain. These problems are further compounded by lack of bank implementation on the obligations they do have.


The banks assessed failed to properly disclose - much less address - serious ESG risks identified in the operations of their major clients. Unreported risks included use of fire to clear land, labor violations, human rights violations, peatland development and deforestation. The report presents a suite of policy recommendations to close regulatory loopholes, improve bank risk management processes, and to increase transparency and accountability to the public and communities impacted by reckless bank financing.
Edisutrisno, Executive Director or TuK-Indonesia said: “Companies are regularly implicated in using fire in their concessions, and have plans to continue developing flammable peatland thereby perpetuating fire risk. Yet banks continue to offer these clients vast sums of credit without conditioning finance on legal or sustainable operations. This indiscriminate financing ensures companies have no real incentive to change.”
Alex Helan, who analysed the data for RAN, said: “When you follow the money, you can see that banks from the countries worst affected by the crisis – Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore – are major financiers of the disastrous status quo.”
Made Ali, Executive Director of Jikalahari, said: “Since financial institutions are ignoring their current obligations, the financial regulator OJK must step in and compel banks to adopt minimum lending criteria for all high-risk sectors and ensure these standards are met. Regulations must be backed by financial penalties if banks continue to finance companies involved in fire and other operations that put the health and wellbeing of communities at risk.”

Madrid ",Banks and investors against the future,,,,,,"
BankTrack, Urgewald, IIDMA, 350.org and other partner NGOs have published new research identifying the top financiers and investors behind the expansion of the world’s coal plant fleet. Following today’s release of the data, BankTrack, Urgewald and other NGO partners will discuss the research findings and provide further insights at a press conference at the summit on Monday, Dec 9th at 5:30pm. 


Japanese and European banks top lenders, Chinese banks top underwriters


US companies biggest institutional investors in the coal plant pipeline 


“The UN Secretary General, the IPCC and climate scientists worldwide have time and again called for a speedy phase-out of coal-based energy production, but most financial institutions are still turning a deaf ear. Over the past 3 years, financial institutions have channeled US$ 745 billion to companies planning new coal power plants,” said Heffa Schuecking, director of Urgewald.

 

The NGOs’ new data covers both lending and underwriting between January 2017 and September 2019 for all 258 coal plant developers identified on Urgewald’s Global Coal Exit List. Altogether, there are still over 1,000 new coal power stations or units in the pipeline. If built, these projects would add 570 GW to the global coal plant fleet, an increase of 28%.
“Most of the top banks providing loans or investment banking services to these companies acknowledge the risks of climate change, but their actions are a slap in the face to the Paris Climate Agreement,” said Greig Aitken, climate campaigner at BankTrack.

 
Top lenders to coal plant developers

 

Since January 2017, 307 commercial banks have provided US$ 159 billion in direct loans to coal plant developers. The top 3 lenders are the Japanese banks Mizuho (US$ 16.8 billion), Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (US$ 14.6 billion) and the Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (US$ 7.9 billion). The 4th and 5th largest lenders to coal plant developers are Citigroup (US$ 5.7 billion) and BNP Paribas (US$ 4.3 billion).

 

A regional breakdown of the data shows that Japanese banks accounted for 32% of direct lending to coal plant developers since 2017.

 

Shin Furuno from 350.org Japan said: “Japan’s top three banks are undermining the Paris Agreement and tarnishing their reputations as the world’s biggest lenders to coal plant developers. Global banks must align their portfolios with the Paris climate goals by ending finance for the coal sector altogether and actively funding the transition towards a zero carbon future.”

 

European banks are, however, not far behind. They accounted for 26% of all bank loans to coal plant developers since 2017.

 

Greig Aitken from BankTrack commented: “This shows how insufficient the climate policies still are at the vast majority of banks. While leading European banks like BNP Paribas and Barclays rule out direct project financing for new coal plants, these institutions continue to provide corporate loans to companies that are pushing forward new coal plants.”

 

The same can be said of the Spanish bank Santander, one of the main sponsors of the 2019 UN Climate Summit in Madrid.

 

Carlota Ruiz-Bautista, an environmental lawyer from Instituto Internacional de Derecho y Medio Ambiente (IIDMA), commened: “Santander claims it will not provide direct financing to new coal plants, but in 2018 and 2019 the bank made corporate loans totaling US$ 655 million to PGE, Tauron and Energa, three companies that are planning to build 5.7 GW of new coal-fired capacity in Poland.

 

“The data shows that the bank has been increasing its coal developer financing year on year since 2017. The bank may be sponsoring the UN Climate Summit, but its lending is heaping coal on the fire.”

Top underwriters of the coal plant developers

 

Since January 2017, 300 commercial banks have channeled over US$ 585 billion to coal plant developers through underwriting.

 

The world’s top five underwriters of coal plant developers are all Chinese institutions. They are the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (US$ 33 billion), the Ping An Insurance Group (US$ 27.4 billion), the China International Trust and Investment Corporation (US$ 25.7 billion), the Bank of China (US$ 24.1 billion) and the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (US$ 22.4 billion).

 

Although Chinese banks only account for 5% of direct lending to coal plant developers, they play an overwhelming role when it comes to underwriting. Since January 2017, Chinese banks accounted for 69% of underwriting for coal plant developers.

 

This figure reflects China’s dominant role in coal plant development. In addition to the 217 GW of new capacity in China’s own coal plant pipeline, Chinese companies have plans to build 54 GW of new coal capacity abroad.

 

Several Japanese, US and UK banks are, however, also important underwriters of coal plant developers. Among these are Mizuho (US$ 14.3 billion), Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (US$ 12.6 billion), Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (US$ 10.5 billion), Citigroup (US$ 8.8 billion), JP MorganChase (US$ 6.2 billion), HSBC (US$ 6.2 billion) and Standard Chartered (US$ 5.9 billion).

Top institutional investors in coal plant developers

 

While banks play a central role in helping coal plant developers acquire capital through underwriting their share and bond issuances, the ultimate buyers of these securities are investors. For 2019, the NGOs’ research identified 1,922 institutional investors with combined holdings of US$ 276 billion in coal plant developers. 1
The world’s largest investor in coal plant developers is the US-based investment giant BlackRock, which holds bonds and shares valued at US$ 17.6 billion in 86 coal plant developers. Next in line are Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund (US$ 17.4 billion) and the US investment managers Vanguard (US$ 12.4 billion) and Capital Group (US$ 9 billion).
A regional analysis shows that US investors account for 29% of institutional investments in the shares and bonds of coal plant developers. Japanese investors account for 23%, Indian investors for 12% and European investors for 11.6% of institutional investments in coal plant developers. Out of the US$ 32 billion, European investors hold in shares and bonds of coal plant developers, almost 30% are held by investors from the UK.

 

“The hypocrisy of investors like BlackRock is huge. Last April, the world’s largest asset manager published a new tool to help investors identify climate-related risks in their portfolio. Through its reckless investments in coal plant developers, BlackRock, however, plays a major role in fueling these risks,” comments Doug Norlen of Friends of the Earth US.
What needs to be done?

 

According to the 2018 IPCC Report, coal-based energy production must be reduced by 78% by 2030 if we want to keep the 1.5°C target within reach. And each new coal power plant is a further stumbling block towards achieving this goal. The UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, has therefore used each and every opportunity to make public appeals for “no new coal by 2020”. 

 

Some financial institutions have begun to heed this call. In November 2019, the French insurance giant, AXA, announced that it will stop insuring or investing in companies that plan to build over 300 MW of new coal-fired power capacity or develop new coal mines.

 

In June 2019, Crédit Agricole became the first commercial bank to announce a ban on financial services to companies planning new coal power plants, coal mines or coal transport infrastructure. All in all, European investors representing US$ 7 trillion in assets have already adopted policies excluding investments in coal plant developers.

 

“These examples show what needs to be done,” said Schuecking. “Financial Institutions that continue channeling money to coal plant developers are actively working against the Paris Climate Goals and ruining our chances for a livable future.”
Notes for editors:

 

1. Among the institutional investors covered in this research are pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds, asset management companies, sovereign wealth funds and asset management arms of banks. It is likely that the investments of these institutions in coal plant developers are, in fact, significantly higher than indicated. Financial databases’ coverage of bond holdings is often incomplete and many pension funds do not report their holdings.

London, UK ","Big four UK banks providing billions for coal power expansion, urged to ‘clean up their acts’ for Glasgow COP",Barclays ,United Kingdom,,,,"
A new report, 'The UK's dirty coal secret', reveals that one year out from the UK’s hosting of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 26) in Glasgow, Barclays, HSBC, RBS and Standard Chartered have collectively supported the world’s top coal power expansion companies with $26.2 billion in financing during the period January 2017 to September 2019. 
The NGOs publishing the report, BankTrack, urgewald and 350.org, have identified that this financing – project finance, corporate lending and underwriting – by the big four UK banks has gone to 48 companies around the world which currently have plans to construct 163 gigawatts (GW) of new coal plant capacity.
By supporting these companies, the UK’s big four banks are facilitating a potential increase to the global coal plant fleet capacity of more than 16 times the UK coal fleet’s current operational capacity, according to the report which is based on available information from financial databases. 1
While the UK continues to wean itself off coal with a 2025 domestic phase-out target in place, Barclays, HSBC, RBS and Standard Chartered still have only limited policy restrictions to curb their coal power financing globally. 
As the report describes, UK banks are trailing behind more than ten of their European competitors which have begun to respond to the climate emergency by introducing coal finance restrictions which do a lot more than merely stopping direct finance for coal plant projects.  
The UK banks’ policy lag is resulting in largely unfettered financing for coal power expansion companies, particularly for Asian companies to whom $16.7 billion of the UK top four financing has gone in the research period.   
Tonny Nowshin, Diaspora Organiser at 350.org, said:
“It's a real double standard that the UK is phasing out coal at home, yet UK banks continue to finance new coal projects in Bangladesh, Vietnam and in other countries where climate change is already having its worst impacts. Fossil fuel financiers have to stop bankrolling the destruction of our climate, the natural world and people's livelihoods now.”  
The new research has found that, since the beginning of 2017, financial support from the top UK banks to coal expansion companies breaks down as: 


Barclays: $7.46 billion


HSBC: $7.92 billion


RBS: $2.28 billion 


Standard Chartered: $8.56 billion  


This financial support from the UK’s big four banks has gone to some of the most aggressive coal power companies in terms of their expansion plans and coal-based business focus. Among the 48 beneficiary companies are National Thermal Power Corporation of India, State Power Investment Corporation of China, PLN Persero of Indonesia, Adani of India and Fortum of Finland.
Katrin Ganswindt of urgewald said:
“The coal policy coverage of the top UK banks is shockingly weak, so it’s no surprise that their financing of some of the world’s most climate and health-damaging companies is consistently strong. UK banks should use the remaining 12 month until Glasgow COP wisely:  Barclays, HSBC, RBS and Standard Chartered should clean up their acts and stop financing coal companies before it is too late for the climate and all of us.”
Greig Aitken of BankTrack said:
“Despite the threat of stranded assets and climate breakdown, UK banks are not doing enough to make the necessary exit from coal. Helping to drive climate disaster globally and impose severe pollution on millions of people in Asia particularly is appalling, when so many renewable energy projects in the region need financial support. The UK public and many others around the world will be making sure these banks come to their senses in the next 12 months before Glasgow.”

",Co-operative Bank signs recognition agreement with union of customers,The co-operative bank ,United Kingdom,,,,"
The Co-operative Bank has signed a formal recognition agreement with The Customer Union for Ethical Banking, an independent organisation representing thousands of Co-operative Bank customers concerned about the UK’s social and environmental issues. This recognition agreement is the first time that a UK business has formally recognised a union of its customers, and strengthens the bank's position as a key player in ethical banking.
Rob Harrison from the Customer Union said: “In this moment of climate crisis, it is particularly disappointing that the big five high street banks in the UK are still using customers’ money to invest in fossil fuel projects.  This makes it all the more important that there is still a mainstream bank out there which offers people another choice and a way to take action.  This recognition agreement demonstrates commitment to listening and co-operating with its customers.”
The Customer Union for Ethical Banking (https://saveourbank.coop/) was established in 2016 following a successful crowd-funding campaign. It has 10,000 members and supporters who are customers of the Co-operative Bank and is itself a member-owned co-operative. It exists to represent customers  who are keen to ensure the Bank maintains and extends its unique customer-led Ethical Policy. It costs £12 a year for customers to become a full member of the union. As a united voice, members can join together to press for the kind of policies and products they want the Bank to consider.
The Co-operative Bank’s Ethical Policy has included a commitment not to bank any business whose core activity contributes to global climate change via fossil fuel extraction or production since 1988. In 2015 it was the only UK bank to sign the Paris Pledge to end financing for the coal industry and in September 2019 the Bank gave colleagues time off to support the Global Climate Strike.
The Customer Union and the Bank have been engaging informally for several years and have built a good working relationship. With the Bank investing in growth again, making this relationship more formal will reassure Customer Union members of the Bank’s commitment to ethics and create a basis for co-operation to help develop initiatives to address the most pressing issues of our day. 
Ryan Brightwell from the Union said: “We don’t expect to agree all the time, but this agreement means we commit to working constructively for a good outcome in every case.” 
Chris Larmer, Director of Customer Experience for The Co-operative Bank said: “Our customers are at the heart of our thinking and it’s fantastic to collaborate with a group who are staunch advocates of what makes us different to other banks – our values and ethics. Our customer-led Ethical Policy is central to everything we do, and we are delighted that the Customer Union want to support us in making a difference through our ethical position. At a time when more people are seeking greener choices, our Bank provides a way for consumers to say no to fossil fuels, and make a difference to communities, tackling the issues that are important to our customers.”

",Report on French banks’ colossal carbon footprint,BNP Paribas ,France,,,,"
Friends of the Earth France and Oxfam France are publishing today, on the eve of Climate Finance Day which will bring major international finance players to Paris, a new report entitled ""French banks’ colossal carbon footprint : a matter of State"". They analyse greenhouse gas emissions from the financing and investment activities of the four main French banks - BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole, Société Générale and Banque Populaire Caisse d’Epargne - in the fossil fuel sector in 2018. The report reveals that the carbon footprint of French banks represents 4.5 times the greenhouse gas emissions of France. BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole and Société Générale each emit more than France alone, compromising the objective of keeping global warming below 1.5°C.


One Planet Summit, Climate Finance Days... At France’s initiative, the number of major events aimed at mobilizing finance for the climate has increased since COP21 in 2015. However these put communication above action, suggesting that the climate challenge is being taken care of thanks to finance industry self-regulation. But the figures made public today reflect a different reality.
Alexandre Poidatz, advocacy officer ’Financing the Energy Transition’ with Oxfam France, said: ""Climate change, and the people who are already its victims, especially in the poorest countries, cannot afford the luxury of banks’ tiny steps. By massively and continuously supporting coal, oil and gas, French banks are among the main contributors to the 1°C of global warming observed since the pre-industrial period. Getting French banks out of their fossil fuel addiction is a matter of life and death. Our ability to guarantee the stability of the financial system (1) as well as to avoid the most dramatic natural and human disasters depends on it.”
Friends of the Earth France and Oxfam France stress that guaranteeing decent living conditions on earth and preventing new systemic financial crises are the prerogatives of public authorities. They denounce the passivity of the government, which positions itself as a leader in green finance at the international level, but relinquishes its responsibilities onto private actors. NGOs point to the influence of the banking industry on policy decisions, resulting from aggressive direct lobbying and the numerous shifts of senior officials from the public to the private sector and vice versa.
Lorette Philippot, private finance campaigner with Friends of the Earth France said: ""Only a year ago, French Economy and Finance Minister, Bruno Le Maire, first brandished the threat of restrictive regulation of the banks’ climate change activities (2). But behind the rhetoric, the government continues to delegate the mission of extinguishing the fire to arsonists. From scientists, associations, and citizens, to the French High Council for Climate - all voices demand strong and immediate political action to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The government has the power and responsibility to redirect private capital flows to the low-carbon economy and to align finance with climate goals: it must hold banks accountable.”
As financial actors meet again in Paris on Friday 29 November as part of the Climate Finance Day, Friends of the Earth France and Oxfam France call on the French government to put in place as of 2020 binding standards to ensure that the activities of French banks align with the goals of the Paris Agreement, with the objective of limiting global warming to 1.5°C. Such standards should ensure that banks end their support for expanding fossil fuels and plan for a full exit from coal, oil and gas. The State must guarantee as a priority a coal phase out by 2030 at the latest in European and OECD countries, and by 2040 worldwide.
Key figures

In 2018, greenhouse gas emissions from major French banks reached more than 2 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent, 4.5 times France’s emissions that same year;
BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole and Société Générale each have a higher carbon footprint than France;
In 2018, the carbon intensities of Société Générale and BNP Paribas were three times higher than those of the BPCE group.

This report also contains a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the influence of the banking lobby:

In 2018, the entire financial industry spent more than EUR 15 million on lobbying activities in France alone, with 190 interest representatives;
Within the financial industry, the four main French banks spent EUR 5.5 million to exert their influence in the public sphere;
Among the top executives of banks and their professional associations, 30 of them are former officials of the Ministry of Economy and Finance.




This report is based on a research commissioned by the independent research firm Profundo. The research covers the financing and investment activities of four French banks - BNP Paribas, Société Générale, Crédit Agricole, Banque Populaire Caisse d’Epargne - for 4,797 companies. At the initiative of Dutch financial institutions, the Partnership Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) methodology was used to quantify the carbon footprint of these French banks in 2018 associated with their support for companies active in the energy or fossil fuel sector.
(1) The dependence of banks on fossil fuels represents a risk that can be very costly for the economy, and for financial actors themselves. The financial world will have to deal with the massive depreciation of carbon assets, which will be penalised by the transition to a low-carbon economy.
(2) Bruno Le Maire (2018) Speech at the Climate Finance Day: ""I ask  to definitively stop financing the most polluting activities, in particular coal . If these commitments are not respected, we will make them binding.”

European coal campaigners have welcomed the publication of coal finance restrictions by UniCredit, the last major European bank to issue a formal coal policy, but also warned that this new approach allows the bank to continue supporting European coal utilities such as EPH in the Czech Republic which are posing a serious threat to the climate and public health.
According to the latest NGO research, since the Paris Agreement was signed UniCredit has provided over $4 billion via lending and underwriting to companies still planning to develop new coal plants, including Yildirim (Turkey), Vale (Brazil), Uniper (Germany) and Fortum (Finland). 1
UniCredit’s new policy commits the bank to stop directly financing new coal projects, a financing restriction which has become commonplace among major European banks over the last four years. 
It has also introduced conditions to govern its corporate lending and underwriting for coal mining and coal power companies, though these conditions provide leeway for UniCredit to continue financing existing clients which are looking to expand their coal-related businesses. 2 
Antonio Tricarico, of Re:Common in Rome, said:
“Under its new sustainability slogan ‘Do the right thing!’, UniCredit has come a good distance on coal with the new policy. But to really do the right thing, UniCredit should follow-up quickly with an explicit commitment to immediately stop financing coal expansionists, and a pledge to fully exit coal at the latest by 2030 in OECD countries and by 2040 elsewhere, as the scientific community is now insisting has to happen if we are to avoid runaway climate change.”
NGOs which have engaged with UniCredit during the shaping of the new policy have been arguing for the bank to demonstrate ambitious climate action by requiring its coal clients to adopt a rigorous roadmap for exiting coal by 2030. The Global Coal Exit List provides such clear coal exclusion criteria.
Antonio Tricarico said:
“The coal challenge which we laid down to UniCredit’s senior management at the bank’s AGM earlier this year has been partially met. But if CEO Jean Pierre Mustier is serious about the fight against climate change he has to be brave enough to say farewell to existing coal baron clients such as EPH. UniCredit is also currently considering a full pull-out of its business in Turkey, and the bank should recognise that its financing of Turkish coal companies in recent years has generated huge losses for shareholders.”
Yesterday’s release of new sustainability policies also sees new commitments from UniCredit on Arctic and non-conventional oil and gas, covering the bank’s approach to tar sands, ultra-deep water oil and gas extraction, and shale oil & gas (fracking). 
The bank will no longer provide project finance to these sub-sectors and it will restrict corporate financing to clients whose revenues from activities in these sub-sectors do not exceed 25% of overall company revenues.  
Greig Aitken, of BankTrack, said:
“It’s welcome to see, finally, some fossil fuels policy advance from UniCredit, both on coal and unconventional oil and gas. UniCredit has to quickly build on these commitments by doing what the climate science now requires, and that means pledging to immediately stop financing any coal expansion as well as fully phasing-out of coal by 2030 in OECD countries, and by 2040 elsewhere. 
“Two weeks ago, the European Investment Bank demonstrated what is needed from major financiers in the face of the climate emergency when it committed to stop financing all unabated fossil fuel projects by the end of 2021. The rules of responsible, climate sensitive energy financing have been redrawn, and UniCredit and the rest of the commercial banking sector now have to up their ambition levels, and quickly.” 
Notes for editors:
1. Data taken from forthcoming NGO research into global banks’ financing for companies developing new coal plants, to be published during the UN Climate Summit in Madrid. 
2.  For criteria to be applied to corporate loans for coal fired power generation (CFPG) companies, UniCredit's new policy for the coal sector states: 
“Financing or financial services are provided to coal fired power generation companies only if they meet the following criteria:
• New clients:
-- current installed coal power capacity ≤30%; and
-- clear strategy to reduce reliance on CFPG to ≤5% by 2025.
• Existing clients:
-- if current installed power capacity > 30%, clear commitment to reduce their share of installed coal power capacity at least in line with Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) of the countries where their operations are located; UniCredit will orderly exit the business relationship by year 2025 if the criteria is not met;
-- if current installed power capacity <= 30%, annual review on commitments to reduce their share in future years.”
Among NGO concerns on these requirements is that in various EU countries NDCs are regarded as unambitious and provide no yardstick for ensuring the necessary climate action under the Paris Agreement.

","4 out of 5 banks failing on human rights, new BankTrack Human Rights Benchmark shows",ABN AMRO ,Netherlands,,,,"
Banks are failing on human rights nearly a decade after new UN principles were established to guide their behavior, according to the third BankTrack Human Rights Benchmark, published today. Lloyds, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Société Générale are among the worst performers in the report, which ranks commercial banks from leaders to laggards according to their efforts to uphold human rights. 
“There is increasing ‘lip-service’ paid to human rights compliance by the biggest global banks, but in the vast majority of cases it goes no further than this,” said report author Ryan Brightwell. “Banks are still implicated in – or even directly facilitating – human rights abuses, including violations of Indigenous peoples’ rights, land grabs and even war crimes.”
Dutch bank ABN AMRO tops the league table, the only bank to be classed as a ‘leader’ for the breadth of its human rights commitments and reporting. The highest-performing UK and US banks are Barclays and Citi respectively, which both make it to the ‘front runners’ group. However, even these banks have much room for improvement before they can be said to be adequately implementing their human rights responsibilities. 
The report shows that more banks than ever have human rights policies in place. However, not one bank is able to show that it is making a difference to people on the ground by addressing specific abuses, and the pace of change is painstakingly slow. The vast majority of banks gave no evidence at all that they have prevented, mitigated or remedied specific human rights abuses in practice.
“Regulators will need to intervene if banks continue to fail,” said BankTrack director Johan Frijns. “Recent moves in the UK, France and the Netherlands are a step in the right direction but don’t go far enough. Governments must make it clear they will take further action if banks don’t step up.”
In the Netherlands, banks’ progress towards their human rights obligations has been driven by the Dutch Banking Sector Agreement on Human Rights, a multistakeholder process backed up by the threat of regulation. Recent legislation in the UK (the Modern Slavery Act) and France (the Duty of Vigilance law) is compelling banks to be more transparent about their commitments to uphold human rights. However, it is not strong enough to hold banks fully accountable for human rights abuses they are responsible for or implicated in. 
The absolute poorest performers, scoring less than one point out of a possible 14, include the Chinese banks ICBC, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China and China Construction Bank, as well as Royal Bank of Canada. All five Canadian banks appeared in the ‘laggards’ section of the table.
Sara Blackwell, Associate Director of the Investor Alliance for Human Rights, commented: ""Members of the Investor Alliance for Human Rights – representing nearly US$4 trillion in assets under management and 18 countries – need human rights analysis and data to engage with their own responsibilities to respect human rights throughout their investment activities. The 2019 BankTrack Human Rights Benchmark provides critical information for our members as they engage portfolio banks on how their policies and practices stack up against the expectations of the UN Guiding Principles, and we’ll be using our collective leverage to hold up its findings.”
Joanne Bauer, Adjunct Professor of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University, a member of the report's Independent Academic Advisory Panel, commented: ""This report raises the important question of what more it will take for banks to give due priority to human rights in their due diligence of deals and to use their leverage to make a difference for the people who have been harmed through their financing. While the advances a few banks have made are commendable, all banks can no longer look away.""

Nijmegen, the Netherlands ","Twenty percent of Dominican Republic territory at risk from fossil fuel auction, banks warned to steer clear",Banco Santander ,Spain,,,,"
Ahead of the auctioning tomorrow (November 27) of exploration licenses for 14 onshore and offshore oil and gas blocks in the Dominican Republic, environmental groups are warning commercial banks not to financially back companies which may end up being awarded licenses.

 

Dominican group National Committee against Climate Change (CNLCC), Re:Common and BankTrack have raised concerns over the major climate risks and adverse environmental and social impacts which would result from the opening up of fossil fuel blocks in the country’s Cibao, Enriquillo, Azua, and San Pedro basins.

 

The proposed hydrocarbon blocks together cover more than 20 percent of Dominican territory.  

 

Tomorrow’s auction in Houston, Texas will be held by Dominican Republic's Ministry of Energy and Mines which is being assisted by the global natural resources consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Antonio Isa Conde, the minister responsible, has so far confirmed that only the US oil company Apache has prequalified for the auction. 

 

CNLCC has called on the Congress of the Dominican Republic to question the minister in order to shed light on the contractual commitments the government may enter into with prospective oil companies. The licensing round has been shrouded in secrecy, and CNLCC has argued for the auction to be suspended or postponed until there is more transparency and until the population has a final say in the destiny of the country’s natural resources.

 
Enrique de Leon, of the National Committee against Climate Change, said:

 

“It beggars belief that Antonio Isa Conde and his ministry have the unchecked power to reach agreements with foreign companies in a closed and secretive bidding process for oil and gas exploration licenses. These projects could result in severe impacts for the Dominican people, for tourism and the national economy, not to mention the dire climate change implications if these resources are tapped.

 

“Our national parliament has to have oversight of and a decisive say in the shaping of contracts which could affect both our national sovereignty and the resources which belong to the Dominican people. This auction in Texas should not be proceeding before our parliament is informed properly and comes to a verdict, and a national referendum then has the final say.”

 

CNLCC, Re:Common and BankTrack have worked closely over the last four years to challenge the highly controversial Punta Catalina coal plant in Dominican Republic and the financing role in the USD 2 billion project played by a consortium of European banks comprising Deutsche Bank, Société Générale, ING, Santander and UniCredit. 

 

The project has been directly implicated since 2016 in the global corruption scandal involving the Brazilian construction company Odebrecht, which received the Punta Catalina contract due to an opaque, allegedly criminal tendering process. As a result, the European banks were compelled in 2018 to freeze their project finance disbursements, with ING the only member of the consortium to have acknowledged publicly that it has sold its stake in the project.

 
Antonio Tricarico, of Re:Common, said:

 

“The Punta Catalina scandal is still not resolved after several years, and here we are again. More colossal fossil fuel development, in highly dubious circumstances, is threatening the environmental, social and economic rights of Dominicans, right at the moment when climate science is telling us very clearly that oil and gas have to stay in the ground.

 

“Due diligence was clearly lacking from those European banks which chose to get involved in the Punta Catalina project. All banks should now save themselves a lot of reputational and financial risk by distancing themselves sooner rather than later from yet another outrageous fossil fuel fiasco in the Dominican Republic.”

 
Greig Aitken, of BankTrack, said:

 

“At what point do banks draw the line on egregious fossil fuel financing? The likes of Citi, JPMorgan Chase, HSBC, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs are happy to fill their boots by arranging the IPO of Saudi Aramco, the world’s biggest corporate polluter. But as devastating climate change impacts intensify around the world, pulling back from endorsing the destruction of 20 percent of a developing country’s territory through fossil fuel exploitation has to be that line, especially when the Dominican Republic has extensive and known renewable energy potential crying out for financial support.”

 
Notes for editors:

 

1. Based on available information (see, for example, this map published in Oil & Gas Journal), CNLCC estimates that the 14 proposed hydrocarbon blocks cover over 20,000 square kilometres onshore and offshore. This equates to at least 20 percent of Dominican Republic’s land and maritime platform.

Nijmegen ","With New Equator Principles, Banks Fail to Act on Climate or Indigenous Rights",,,Dakota Access Pipeline ,energy distribution | oil and gas,United States,"
Equator banks finishing their annual meeting in Singapore yesterday agreed on a new set of Equator Principles that contain no meaningful improvements, and completely fail to meet the challenges of protecting Indigenous peoples’ rights and combating climate change.
Ignoring a passionate call last week from 312 civil society groups from 58 countries to ‘act with courage and ambition’ and take bold action on climate change and human rights, the Equator Principles Association (EPA) instead has opted for continuing with ‘business as usual’ with a text which only tweaks the current Principles and fixes none of the concerns that led to the demand for a revision two years ago.
“It is outright astonishing that a process that set out to make the outdated 2013 version of the Equator Principles future proof, taking into account the outcomes of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which took two years to complete and involved nearly a hundred banks and hundreds of stakeholders, has in the end produced a document that is hardly distinguishable from the 2013 version,” said Johan Frijns, director of BankTrack. “With so little change, this has been a monumental waste of time and resources for everyone involved, and a truly missed opportunity for the Equator Principles Association to lead the banking sector forward in dealing with the many challenges of our time.”
The ‘targeted update process’ agreed upon by the EPA in 2017 aimed at improvements in four areas: 1) the distinction between ‘designated’ and ‘non-designated’ countries, which has allowed a lower level of scrutiny for projects mostly in developed countries, 2) the scope of application of the Principles in terms of financial instruments, 3) human rights, including the rights of Indigenous peoples in particular, and 4) climate change.
Regarding the ‘designated countries’ distinction, the revised EP4 maintains the unjustified distinction between those high-income countries with “robust environmental and social governance, legislation systems and institutional capacity designed to protect their people and the environment”, and ‘non-designated’ countries (typically poorer countries in the Global South) that lack such systems, where projects need to comply with IFC Performance Standards.
Osprey Orielle Lake, Executive Director, Women’s Earth and Climate Action Network (WECAN) said: “Equator banks’ finance for the tragic Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) in the United States, a ‘designated country’, helped trigger the EP4 update. Two years later, environmental protections have been further dismantled in the US as well as in other ‘designated countries’, like Australia. Meanwhile dozens of new fossil fuel projects are proceeding in these countries with disastrous consequences for the climate. Equator banks should have drawn a line in the sand globally, but failed to do so.”
Regarding the scope of the Principles, EP4 only lowers the threshold for corporate loans from 100 to 50 million USD and extends the Principles to include Project-Related Refinance and Project-Related Acquisition Finance, while excluding other financial instruments often used to fund projects.
Alison Kirsch, Climate and Energy Lead Researcher at Rainforest Action Network, said: “The EP4's narrow scope ignores many other ways that projects can be financed, such as through general corporate loans and project-related bonds. The Line 3 tar sands pipeline crossing from Alberta through Minnesota into Wisconsin is already fully constructed in some parts, without having received any financing covered under the EPs, though numerous Equator banks are involved. The project is proceeding without the consent of impacted Indigenous Peoples along the route, not to mention with grave climate implications. This example demonstrates how ineffective the EP4 remain even after this revision.”
Regarding Indigenous rights, EP4 falls short of a clear commitment to uphold Indigenous peoples’ rights including their right to grant or withhold consent for projects situated on Indigenous land and territories (known as Free, Prior and Informed Consent or FPIC), including in ‘designated countries’. Instead, in ‘designated countries’ like the US, the new Principles only require the consultation process with Indigenous Peoples to be ‘evaluated’ by an independent consultant. There is no explicit commitment to respect FPIC in all circumstances.
Carla Fredericks of First Peoples Worldwide, said: “The new Equator Principles’ failure to implement  FPIC as a right means they would be unlikely to prevent Equator banks from financing another situation just like DAPL, with all the associated risks to the feasibility of the projects,  the reputation of banks financing them, and the Indigenous peoples themselves. Yet this was the most basic expectation of this revision process, from civil society and concerned banks alike. The new version fails on that count.”
Osprey Orielle Lake, Executive Director, Women’s Earth and Climate Action Network (WECAN) added: “The banks have failed to make a commitment to uphold Indigenous peoples’ rights worldwide —specifically  protecting their right to grant or withhold consent for projects situated on Indigenous land and territories.”
With regard to climate change, EP4 pays lip service to the Paris climate agreement, stating in the preamble that “we support the objectives of the 2015 Paris Agreement”. However it does not include even a single requirement that would exclude finance for projects that endanger the Paris goals, and fails to require consideration of Scope 3 indirect emissions resulting from the projects, which should be a critical factor for infrastructure projects such as pipelines. Even projects that are incompatible with the host country’s national climate commitments are still permitted for financing under the EPs. As a result, the Principles continue to allow for Equator finance for new coal-fired power plants and other new fossil fuel infrastructure, even though scientists have made clear that these are incompatible with limiting global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees.
Sierra Club campaign representative Ben Cushing said: “How clear do the world’s scientists need to make it before Equator banks recognize that every new fossil fuel project they finance takes us further away from averting climate disaster and therefore poses a huge risk to us all, banks included? These updated principles are a huge missed opportunity to ensure banks aren’t supporting dangerous projects that threaten our climate.”
Looking beyond these four improvement areas, the new Equator Principles again fail to deal with long standing shortcomings around transparency and accountability, with these topics deferred to a to be established new ‘operations working group’ and still to be developed ‘guidance notes’. The new Principles also continue to allow extensive discretion to adopting banks on how to implement the principles in specific finance situations.
Ryan Brightwell, human rights coordinator at BankTrack said: “The new Equator Principles reference banks’ responsibility to respect human rights under the UN Guiding Principles, but the UN Guiding Principles explicitly call for industry standards like this to operate accountability mechanisms so communities can raise complaints when the standards are not met. By once again failing to introduce such a grievance mechanism, the Equator Principles themselves are ignoring their UN-mandated responsibilities to respect human rights. It is not enough that this shortcoming has been deferred to a new Operations Working Group to consider, along with a host of other matters.”
Johan Frijns, BankTrack director concluded: “What we expected from banks were principles, clear rules that determine what sort of projects gets financed and what not. With the formulation  ’as appropriate’ remaining in the text no less than 14 times, leaving crucial matters to the discretion of adopting banks themselves, it may be better to from now on refer to EP4 as the Equator Flexibles.”
Faced with this extremely disappointing outcome of the revision process, the organisations that take part in the ‘Equator Banks, Act!’ campaign have vowed to actively resist the financing by Equator banks of all new fossil fuel projects and all projects that impact Indigenous peoples’ rights and territories that lack free, prior and informed consent.

",New OECD guidance clarifies banks’ responsibilities to prevent and address adverse impacts,,,,,,"
On October 28th, 2019, the OECD launched new guidance on Due Diligence for Responsible Corporate Lending and Securities Underwriting (hereinafter “the guidance”). The guidance is based and elaborates on the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, providing authoritative clarifications of banks’ responsibilities to prevent adverse impacts on human rights and the environment. This is the OECD’s second guidance paper on responsible business conduct in the financial sector, following the 2017 guidance on Responsible Business Conduct for Institutional Investors.


This new guidance represents important progress and a step forward in the international normative framework that serves to encourage responsible conduct by banks and other financial sector actors and that also serves to hold financial actors accountable for adverse social and environmental impacts associated with their activities. It provides authoritative clarifications of government-backed expectations of banks, making particularly important clarifications on issues related to when a bank has “contributed” to an adverse impact through its lending or underwriting and what role a bank can and should play in remediating adverse impacts associated with its activities.


The 48 governments adhering to the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises have made a commitment to promote this guidance with banks and monitor its implementation, and banks operating or headquartered in these 48 countries are expected to follow the guidance. Civil society, including trade unions, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and individuals, who feel that a bank has not abided by the recommended responsible behaviour can file a complaint against the bank at the National Contact Point (NCP) in the country in which the bank is headquartered and request that the NCP refer to the guidance in providing recommendations to the bank.


Some key areas in which the new paper provides important clarifications and guidance related to the due diligence and responsible conduct expected of banks include:

 

Relationship of banks to adverse impacts and remedy
Bank-level grievance mechanisms
Transparency and client confidentiality
Sustainability responsibilities
Public policy advocacy
Engagement with rightsholders
Disengagement and divestment

 

OECD Watch and Banktrack have developed a briefing analysing and elaborating on each of these areas.The briefing can be accessed here.

London, UK ",Failure of Aramco IPO gives a black eye to bank CEOs and a warning to investors,Bank of America ,United States,Saudi Aramco ,oil and gas,Saudi Arabia,"
Saudi Arabia has announced that the long-heralded partial IPO of its national oil company, Saudi Aramco, will be drastically scaled back. The banks that were about to go on the road to sell shares to investors in Asia, Europe and North America have been told to cancel these plans as the shares will now only be formally marketed to investors in Saudi Arabia and allied Gulf states.
Reports indicate that the Saudi regime’s desired valuation for Aramco was substantially more than international investors were prepared to pay, including because of doubts about future oil demand in an era of climate crisis.
The offering is being led by nine banks: JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, HSBC and Credit Suisse, as well as National Commercial Bank and SAMBA Financial Group from Saudi Arabia.
The Financial Times reports that the banks are “now turning on each other” over “the deal’s degeneration into, what one banker called a 'Greek tragedy'.” The banks’ hopes for huge fees from the deal will likely have to be scaled back significantly.
JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has been particularly closely involved in promoting the IPO.
A coalition of environmental groups — Rainforest Action Network, BankTrack, Earthworks, Friends of the Earth U.S., Global Witness, Indigenous Environmental Network, Oil Change International, ShareAction, Sierra Club, and 350.org — had warned banks to stay away from selling shares in the world’s largest corporate emitter of carbon dioxide. The groups also criticised the banks’ willingness to raise billions of dollars for Saudi Arabia given the Kingdom’s horrendous record on human rights.
Patrick McCully, Climate and Energy Program Director of Rainforest Action Network, said:
“This is a whopping black eye for Jamie Dimon, and for the bank CEOs. They were misled by their own greed to think that in an era of acute concern over climate change they could still make out like bandits from this deal while ignoring concerns about the Saudi government’s human rights record and its goals to expand oil and gas production.”
Johan Frijns, Director of BankTrack, said:
“Just two months after the launch of the Principles for Responsible Banking, prominent signatory banks such as Citi and Credit Suisse have no issues with getting involved in this IPO, this despite Saudi Arabia’s horrendous human rights record and the immense climate impact that will result from an expansion of oil production by Aramco. These banks claim to be concerned about climate change and human rights, yet their involvement in the Aramco IPO makes it grimly clear that their heads are stuck firmly in the sand.”
Hannah McKinnon, Director of Energy Transitions and Futures for Oil Change International, said:
“The value of oil depends on the future of oil, and the future of oil depends on our success tackling the climate emergency. As people-powered movements drive governments and financial institutions towards the higher ambition needed to stay within the Paris Agreement limits, it is becoming more and more clear that the future of all fossil fuel is bleak.


""We have shown that Aramco’s valuation was highly dependent on oil prices, prices that won’t materialise as demand drops with climate action. This is writing on the wall that obviously others are seeing as they flee the scene on the most carbon intensive offering in history. Chase, Citi and others would do well to reevaluate their substantial backing of fossil fuels in light of the market’s clear scepticism that oil demand will continue to grow.”
Doug Norlen, from Friends of the Earth US, said:
“With the implosion of this Aramco IPO, Jamie Dimon and his Wall Street look-alikes are paying the price for their abuse of the climate and collusion with human rights abusing regimes.”
Catherine Collentine, Associate Director of the Sierra Club’s Beyond Dirty Fuels campaign, said:
“Big banks can’t keep claiming to care about climate action as long as they remain open to making massive investments in fossil fuels. This is yet another reminder that investing in the dirty fuels of the past is bad business.”
Bruce Baizel, Energy Program Director for Earthworks, said:
“Investors should shun the expansion of oil, gas and petrochemicals and the companies like Saudi Aramco looking to pump more oil out of the ground to fuel the climate crisis and to create more plastics that pollute the water we drink, the fish we eat, and the oceans in which they live.”
Carroll Muffett, President of the Center for International Environmental Law, said:
“In the space of three years, the IPO of the world’s largest oil company has gone from unmissable to unmarketable across most of the world. That plummet reflects the growing recognition that sinking resources into climate chaos, widespread human rights violations, and authoritarian regimes creates risks that should be as unacceptable to investors as it is to the planet.”

",Standard Chartered's coal deals undermine leadership of Equator Principles,Standard Chartered ,United Kingdom,Vung Ang II coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Vietnam,"
Environmental campaigning organisations have reacted with astonishment today on the appointment of Standard Chartered as leader of the Equator Principles, given the role the bank has played in multiple recent and current deals that clearly violate these principles.
“Standard Chartered has been a repeat offender of the Equator Principles in recent years,” said Julien Vincent, Market Forces Executive Director. “Even as it assumes this leadership role, it remains involved in a deal for the proposed Vung Ang 2 coal power plant in Vietnam that has failed to satisfy several of the Principles.
“The whole point of the Equator Principles would be undermined if its lead bank pushes ahead with coal deals which so clearly flout the rules.”
“If this appointment is to have any credibility, we should expect to hear Standard Chartered confirm its withdrawal from Vung Ang 2 immediately”, said Mr Vincent. 
The Equator Principles represent the standard for financing of large-scale projects, developed as a risk management framework in order to mitigate the significant environmental and social risks of these projects. Given the myriad risks, large coal power projects are listed as category A  - “Projects with potential  significant adverse environmental and social risks and/or impacts that are diverse, irreversible or unprecedented.”
According to the new Equator Principles, also launched today, an Equator Principles Financial Institution will not provide financial services where the client will not, or is unable to, comply with the EPs. In the case of Vung Ang 2, the Principles are compromised by:

failure to ensure that the sponsors explore alternatives to Vung Ang 2 despite the existence of viable, and in fact soon to be cheaper, renewable alternatives to coal power;
failure to ensure that the project sponsors disclose information key for communities to evaluate the impacts of proposed power stations, whether through ESIAs or other means; and,
failure to require that communities are informed and engaged by ensuring the sponsors hold adequate public consultations and engage stakeholders at the time of the ESIA and on an ongoing basis. (see table below for details on these violations)

Vung Ang 2 is proposed to be constructed on a site proximate to the Formosa Steel plant and the Vung Ang 1 coal plant, both of which have raised community protest. In 2016, a toxic spill from the nearby Formosa steel mill devastated a hundred miles of ocean coastline, decimating fisheries and depriving communities of both sustenance and livelihoods. To make matters worse, ash and air pollution from a nearby coal power power station, Vung Ang 1, has caused communities significant fear for their health, remaining fisheries and farms according to local media reports. Vung Ang 2 will only add to the pollution and uncertainty faced by communities in this area.
Standard Chartered made headlines in September 2018 when it said that it was out of all new coal power, citing the disastrous effects of coal power on climate, but has grandfathered this polluting project, while remaining a major backer of the coal industry through corporate lending and the bond market, keeping it exposed to myriad violations of the Equator Principles.
Standard Chartered is also taking the helm during a period of controversy, as the global cry for accountability for financiers of fossil fuel projects has become stronger. In advance of today’s meeting of the Equator Principles Association, 312 civil society organisations from 58 countries called for a significant revision of the Principles themselves. Projects posing massive environmental and human rights risks to people and planet should no longer be eligible for financing under the Equator Principles, the campaign argued. The call did not stop the Equator Principles Association from adopting a new version of the Equator Principles that amounts to ‘business as usual’ for the initiative in the years to come.
“The Vung Ang 2 coal power project is just an example of a project that shouldn’t be allowed for funding by Standard Chartered and other EP financial institutions under the new Equator Principles, if they are at all concerned about mitigating environmental and social risks. In 2019, with the world facing multiple social and environmental crises, we expect a serious commitment from financial institutions to thoroughly change the way they do business. Sadly, the new Principles will continue to allow the financing of projects that contribute to such crises'' said Johan Frijns, Director of BankTrack. ""Putting Standard Chartered as a continued financier of Vietnamese coal in charge of the Equator Principles would be like putting the fox in charge of the hen house. Standard Chartered must lead the Equator Principles Association by example and immediately withdraw from financing coal projects.""

Principle


Violation




Principle 2: Environmental and Social Assessment 
 
For  all  Projects,  in  all  locations, when  combined  Scope  1 and Scope 2 Emissions are expected to be more than 100,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent annually, an alternatives analysis will be conducted to evaluate less Greenhouse Gas (GHG) intensive alternatives.


Most coal-fired power stations would meet this threshold.
 
There are far safer alternatives to Vung Ang 2 in Vietnam. According to a recent report from financial think tank Carbon Tracker, in 2020 it will already be cheaper in Vietnam to invest in new solar PV than new coal, with new onshore wind generated power expected to become cheaper than coal power in 2021. By the time Vung Ang 2 is built, renewable energy in Vietnam will already be cheaper than coal power.
 
Solar and wind projects have also been proven viable in Vietnam.  Approved solar and wind projects as at July 2019 surpassed targets in Vietnam’s power development plan, with the 2025 target for solar PV capacity installed (4 GW) in Vietnam being met six years early.




Principle 3: Applicable Environmental and Social Standards
 
For Projects located in Non-Designated Countries, the Assessment process evaluates compliance with the then applicable IFC  Performance  Standards  on  Environmental  and  Social  Sustainability  (Performance   Standards)   and the World   Bank   Group Environmental,   Health   and   Safety   Guidelines (EHS Guidelines).


The IFC Performance Standards require consultation directly with project-affected communities.
 
The most recent ESIA from 2011 does not demonstrate that the project-affected community was consulted on the issues.  While consultation meetings were held with government officials, project-affected community members were merely asked questions about various issues such as their knowledge about the project, water usage or transportation needs.
 
Owing to the fact that no further ESIAs have been made public, there is no evidence that the Performance Standards have been complied with.




EP 5: Stakeholder engagement
 
For Projects  with potentially significant   adverse   impacts   on   Affected Communities, the client will   conduct   an   Informed Consultation and Participation process.
 
To  facilitate  Stakeholder  Engagement,  the  client will, commensurate to  the  Project’s  risks  and  impacts,   make   the appropriate Assessment Documentation   readily   available   to   the   Affected Communities,   and  where  relevant  Other  Stakeholders,  in  the  local  language  and  in  a  culturally  appropriate manner.
 
 
 


As noted above, local communities have not been made aware of the potential impacts of this project or been consulted on how to mitigate any harms.  These violations would be ongoing, as the obligations of stakeholder management are ongoing.
 
There was also no indication that project specific information was provided to the community members about the project at the time of the survey that could inform the communities in their decision-making.  In fact, during the survey conducted during the 2011 ESIA it was noted that 136 out of 186 households mentioned that they did not know basic information about the project including the exact location of the project, who the owner of the project was, and the type of project. This was their main concern. The ESIA does not indicate how this information gap was remedied.

","Too little, too late",ANZ ,Australia,,,,"
National Australia Bank (NAB)’s Sustainability Report, released today, is little more than greenwash and a recipe for climate catastrophe, says environmental finance group Market Forces. In particular, its central announcement to exit thermal coal mining by 2035 is a clear example of too little too late, falling short of time frames necessary to hold global warming to 1.5ºC and investor expectations for the elimination of thermal coal.
Signatories to the Global Investor Statement on Climate Change – a group of investors worth USD 35 trillion – demand exiting thermal coal by 2030 in OECD countries, a goal that was matched by Commonwealth Bank’s updated Environmental Policy Framework earlier this year but one that NAB falls short of.
NAB’s updated position comes hours after the European Investment Bank committed to end almost all fossil fuel financing by 2021.
“Whilst the Morrison Government will inevitably fulminate over the thermal coal exit, we need to recognise that NAB’s position on climate change is consistent with the failure of the Paris Agreement, and an invitation to runaway global warming” said Market Forces Executive Director Julien Vincent. “By signalling to coal power plant operators that they can rely on NAB’s support beyond 2030, and having no plan in place to manage down exposure to other fossil fuels such as oil and gas, this is far from a responsible approach to minimise climate risk.”
Market Forces has identified another AUD 1.83 billion loaned by NAB to the fossil fuel sector in the year to June 2019, greater than the AUD 1.59 billion from Westpac over the same period.
NAB’s reported exposure to the fossil fuel industry increased 30% in 2019, compared to ANZ’s increase of 9% and reductions of 15% and 16% from Commonwealth Bank and Westpac respectively.
Market Forces has lodged a shareholder resolution on behalf of shareholders with NAB calling for the disclosure of targets to reduce loan book exposure to the coal, oil and gas sectors in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement.
“NAB has given us no reason to alter this resolution, as they have failed to move on oil and gas and they now have a coal policy that is misaligned with the Paris climate goals. So, we will continue to take the resolution to the annual general meeting.”
The resolution to NAB can be found here.

Paris, France ",Coal finance exit in France – Banks and insurers urged to drop coal expansion clients and make good on commitments,BNP Paribas ,France,Carmichael coal mine project ,mining - coal  | transport and infrastructure,Australia,"
Ahead of Climate Finance Day in Paris and the UN Climate Summit in Madrid, BankTrack and the Unfriend Coal campaign, in partnership with Friends of the Earth France, are calling on French financial institutions to seize the opportunity by immediately freezing business relationships with more than 400 companies which are engaged in developing new coal projects worldwide.
In a briefing published today which analyses French financial institutions’ coal financing and policies, the groups reveal that BNP Paribas is the largest French financier of companies developing new coal-fired power plants. New data shows that the bank has provided at least EUR 2.2 billion in financing to these coal expansion companies in 2019 alone. 
In Indonesia, where pollution from coal is causing the untimely deaths of thousands of people every year, this year BNP Paribas has facilitated EUR 211 million for the state-owned utility PLN Persero via a bond issue. The company currently produces 62% of its electricity from coal and is planning to build 10 gigawatts of new coal-fired electricity generation capacity.
Also featured in the new briefing is top French insurer AXA which no longer directly insures new coal projects but does still issue insurance cover, including for damage, to expansionists in the coal sector.
According to sources in the insurance sector, AXA is one of the companies providing insurance to Adani Mining, the Australian subsidiary of the Indian conglomerate Adani which is planning the massive Carmichael coal mine in Australia. The hugely controversial Carmichael project, which is being vigorously challenged by Indigenous people, communities and groups across Australia and from which more than 60 global financial firms have distanced themselves, is recognised as potentially one of the world’s biggest individual sources of CO2 emissions and also threatens the fragile ecosystem of the Great Barrier Reef.
Indications of positive momentum on coal across the French financial sector emerged in July this year when, following pressure from the French Ministry of Economy and Finance and NGOs, business federations announced that by mid-2020 their members, banks, insurers and investors, must define “a global exit schedule for the financing of coal activities”.
The new briefing presents details on the various remaining gaps between the policies of French financial institutions still highly active in the coal sector and what is necessary if they are to respect the July pledge to publish exit plans for the sector by mid-2020. NGOs are calling for French institutions to now lay out plans that will ensure their exit from coal by 2030 in EU and OECD countries and by 2040 elsewhere.

The state of play with French financial institutions' coal policies.

Lucie Pinson, coordinator of the Unfriend Coal campaign and advisor to Friends of the Earth France’s private finance campaign, commented:
“If it results in concrete climate action, the July commitment will send a strong French signal internationally and could cause a powerful ripple effect. But the risks of greenwashing are enormous. The commitment is non-binding, so there is a clear risk that many French institutions will be reluctant to implement or adopt the necessary measures to get out of coal in time to limit warming to 1.5°C.
“This is particularly true for BNP Paribas and AXA, which are both still pursuing a fundamentally different course by continuing to finance or insure companies which are developing new coal projects.”
Yann Louvel, Climate campaigner at BankTrack, said:
“Complying with the July commitment would require French financial institutions to, as a minimum, refuse to finance or insure the 417 companies engaged in the development of new mines, power plants and coal infrastructure. They should also be taking the necessary steps to set conditions on all financial services for such companies based on their adoption of a closure plan for their existing coal assets, by no later than 2030 in EU and OECD countries, and by 2040 elsewhere.
“Crédit Agricole is on track, although its latest promising commitments announced in June this year still have to be implemented. On the other hand, BNP Paribas has not revised its policy concerning its corporate coal clients in almost four years. Despite having improved their respective coal policies, Société Générale and Natixis are now also under pressure to sharpen their approaches as they have yet to spell out how they will exit from coal within the timeframe set by climate science.”

Nijmegen ","As banks head for Singapore to decide on new Equator Principles, 300+ civil society groups call for ambition and courage ",,,,,,"
312 Civil society organizations from 58 countries have today called upon the financial institutions that make up the Equator Principles Association (EPA) to “act with courage and ambition and not settle for business as usual” when deciding upon a new version of the banking sector’s standards for financing large-scale infrastructure projects at their annual meeting in Singapore, next week from November 18th to 20th.
An “Open letter from Civil Society to all Equator banks”  with this message was delivered earlier today by BankTrack, the civil society banking sector watchdog, to all 100 individual Equator banks and to the EPA secretariat and Steering Committee, on behalf of all signatory organizations. 
The letter expresses deep concern that the ongoing two-year long Equator Principles revision process may well deliver no hard commitments from banks to stop financing projects that pose a high risk to the world’s climate, such as new coal mines and power plants, oil pipelines and gas terminals, and may not succeed in ensuring projects situated on Indigenous Peoples’ land only proceed with their freely given explicit consent. The signatory organizations signal that they would consider such a ‘business as usual’ outcome unacceptable.
The revision process for the Equator Principles was agreed at the 2017 EPA annual meeting in Brazil following BankTrack and allies calling on the EPA to address the ongoing financing under the Equator Principles of projects with a massive negative impact on the world’s climate and which violate Indigenous Peoples’ rights, citing the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) as the most notorious example of such a ‘fully Equator compliant’ project. 
The ‘Equator Banks, Act!’ campaign coalition then called for a complete overhaul of the Equator Principles, including a full rethink of the underlying concept of ‘risk management’ to focus on risks posed by projects to nature and people, and not only on the risks to the project itself. Projects posing massive environmental and human rights risks to people and planet should no longer be eligible for financing under the Equator Principles, the campaign argued.
With one week to go until banks are set to agree the new Equator Principles, the 300+ groups are becoming concerned that no such overhaul of the Principles will be decided upon, and that the new version, ‘EP4’, will allow for the continued financing by Equator banks of precisely the sort of disaster projects that triggered the emergence of the Equator Banks Act coalition in the first place. A draft version of the new Principles was met with deep disappointment by campaigners, and only limited further changes have since been proposed.  
Johan Frijns, director of BankTrack, commented: “With this letter, a wide range of organizations big and small, from community centers to global development organizations to local climate campaigners to indigenous organizations to nature conservation groups to international women’s organizations to national consumer groups and human rights advocates, want to send a clear signal to all Equator banks that anno 2019, with the world facing multiple social and environmental crises, we expect a serious commitment from them to thoroughly change the way they do business, by adopting new Principles that will no longer allow the financing of projects that contribute to such crises''.
Osprey Orielle Lake, Founder/Exec.Dir. Women's Earth and Climate Action Network (WECAN) said: “The current version of the Equator Principles was adopted in 2013, two years before the Paris Climate Agreement. The whole world has by now agreed that in order to reach the Paris climate goals unprecedented steps must be taken, starting with bringing an end to the fossil fuel era. Equator banks must do their share and immediately stop financing coal, oil and gas projects that pose a major risk of locking the world into another few decades of fossil fuels addiction”.
Carla Fredericks, Director of First Peoples Worldwide said: ""More than ever before, Indigenous Peoples around the world are actively resisting the imposition of finance and investment that does not proceed in line with their rights. When investment does not do so, Indigenous Peoples are the first to experience violence and the negative impacts of imposed development. With this letter, these organizations urge all Equator banks to acknowledge their responsibility to respect the human rights of Indigenous Peoples and guarantee their free, prior and informed consent on all projects that affect their communities. If not further revised, the Equator Principles can no longer be relied upon as a proxy for responsible and sustainable project finance.""
Anja Bakken Riise, director of Framtiden i våre hender, said: “The Equator Principles are all about risk management, but the only sensible risk management today is to help ensure that the planetary ecosystem as a whole remains stable. For banks this means an end to financing projects that threaten the climate, lead to forest destruction, pollute our oceans and kill our plants and animal species.”
Ben Cushing, Campaign Representative Beyond Dirty Fuels, Sierra Club said: ""The Dakota Access Pipeline should have taught all Equator banks about the risk of supporting fossil fuel projects against the will of the Indigenous peoples, whose land is being threatened by these projects. Unless banks commit to walking away from fossil fuel projects that threaten the rights of Indigenous communities, they will continue to be exposed to severe reputational and financial risk.""
Moira Birss, Finance Campaign Director Amazon Watch said: ""The brutal murder of forest guardian Paulo Paulino Guajajara in the Brazilian Amazon earlier this month is a tragic reminder of the risks that indigenous peoples face in their efforts to defend their rights, ancestral territories, and our global climate. The Equator Principles revision process purported to address risks to indigenous peoples' rights, yet the current revision does not sufficiently ensure those rights; a lack of adequate indigenous rights protections portends more violence against indigenous peoples, more destruction of essential ecosystems like the Amazon, and more climate chaos.""
Ryan Brightwell, Human rights campaigner at BankTrack said: “This revision of the Equator Principles may well be the last chance for Equator banks to get it right for a long time to come. It would be a huge missed opportunity if the EPA again can’t deal decisively with the systemic flaws that have plagued the Equator Principles for too long. So, be courageous. Commit to full transparency on which projects gets financed under the EPs; be accountable to communities by establishing a mechanism that can deal with grievances if they occur; do not allow financing for projects on Indigenous land without permission, anywhere; and recognise the massive risk posed by fossil fuel projects to both our planet and your own future business.”
Bernadette Maheandiran, Research and Legal Analyst at Market Forces said: “What good is a new set of principles if nothing changes? While much-needed revisions to the EPs are being contested, some non-Equator banks are moving ahead on climate. Banks like Singapore's OCBC, which is out of coal power projects, actually use robust risk assessment frameworks to make sure their project finance lending is up to scratch. In contrast, EP financial institutions continue to finance polluting coal power projects without appropriate public consultation, such as Vung Ang 2 in Vietnam. EP banks like Japan's SMFG, MUFG, Mizuho, SMTB and Standard Chartered must be forced to end their financing of all new coal power and stop risking our collective climate future.”
Greig Aitken, climate campaigner at BankTrack said: “This week’s forest fires directly threatening the suburbs of Sydney are just the latest stark warning that in a world where there is ever less ‘life as usual’ because of climate breakdown, there can be no such thing as ‘business as usual’. Every new fossil fuel project being financed by Equator banks leads us further away from a climate stable world, into a future where neither people nor business can thrive.”

_____________________
Full text: An open Letter from Civil Society to all Equator Principles Financial Institutions (EPFIs)
This November 18-20, your institutions will meet in Singapore at the annual meeting of the Equator Principles Association (EPA), to decide on your commitments under the proposed new Equator Principles, EP4.
As you will recall, the decision to revise the Equator Principles was taken at your 2017 Annual Meeting in Sao Paulo after 270 organisations and 130,000 individuals signed the Equator Banks Act petition, asking your institutions to ‘Stop financing climate disasters’ and to ‘Respect Indigenous Peoples’ rights and territories’.
The petition reflected our deep concern over the ongoing financing by EPFIs of coal, oil and gas extraction and infrastructure projects the world over, with many of these projects situated on the lands and territories of Indigenous Peoples that did not give permission for these projects to proceed. It was triggered when in 2016 no fewer than 14 EPFIs provided finance for the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) in the United States, a project fiercely opposed by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and their allies because of the threat it posed to their water sources - and leading to well-documented human rights violations when these protests were quelled.
If projects such as DAPL can get financed under the Equator Principles, not only will communities and the planet continue to be exposed to major environmental and human rights risks, but also Equator banks themselves will remain exposed to precisely the sort of severe reputational and financial risks that application of the Equator Principles is supposed to prevent.
This month in Singapore, one week before the world meets in Madrid for the 25th Conference of the Parties to the Climate Treaty, your two-year long drafting process for EP4 will come to an end. We do not know what the final proposal will look like, as the final draft of EP4 has not been shared with stakeholders, not even with those that constructively engaged in this two-year discussion.
We do know, however, if the final EP4 closely resembles the draft EP4, it will not put an end to Equator banks’ financing of climate disaster projects; it will not comprehensively ensure the rights of Indigenous Peoples, and it will not deal with other major shortcomings of the Equator Principles that urgently need to be addressed, such as their limited scope and their lack of transparency and accountability. By and large, such an EP4 package would be ‘business as usual’ in the years to come.
Our organisations would consider such an outcome unacceptable.
We strongly believe that at the end of 2019, in a world increasingly prey to an ever- accelerating climate crisis, with forests disappearing at an unprecedented rate, tens of thousands of animal and plant species disappearing with them, with poverty and inequality rising and conflicts over control of land, water and resources deepening, for the Equator Principles to proceed with ‘business as usual’ is not an option.
‘Business as usual’ will see the continued financing by EPFIs of disaster projects that lead to and deepen these many crises. It will not deliver on the central promise of the Equator Principles that ‘negative impacts on project-affected ecosystems, communities, and the climate should be avoided where possible’ (EP3, preamble).
Continuing with ‘business as usual’ will also not help EPFIs operating in our volatile world meet the stated objective of the Principles of adequately managing risk. For this to happen it is necessary that the ‘comprehensive risk management’ concept at the core of the Principles is expanded, so that it no longer only focuses on managing risks posed by external circumstances to a project, but also encompasses all risks that a project will pose to communities, nature and climate, both locally and globally. 
In short, financing coal power plants and other new fossil fuel infrastructure – which pose an immense risk to the world’s climate, and therefore to your future business – can no longer be considered an outcome of adequate risk management; it needs to stop. Financing projects on the lands and territories of Indigenous Peoples against their will, triggering sustained conflicts that also impact your future business, is no longer an option; it needs to stop. Financing projects that will destroy immense swathes of forests, and all life within them, leaving a barren infertile landscape where no future business can thrive is no longer an option; it needs to stop. And so on. 
This is why, right before your Singapore meeting, our organisations once more call upon your institutions to Act, with courage and ambition. 
We call on you to ensure that the EP4 you agree upon in Singapore will not be mere ‘business as usual’, but will contain clear, ambitious and courageous commitments and provisions that no longer allow the financing of projects that pose a direct threat to our world and to your future business, but will steer your investments towards projects that will preserve it and help it thrive for future generations.
Our organisations will carefully monitor the proceedings and outcome of your meeting, and take further action as we deem appropriate.
We wish you a successful meeting!

Nijmegen, the Netherlands ",Environmental groups warn banks against climate and human rights implications of underwriting Saudi Aramco offering,Bank of America ,United States,Saudi Aramco ,oil and gas,Saudi Arabia,"
Saudi Aramco is quickly moving forward with plans to float up to three percent of the national oil company in an Initial Public Offering (IPO). Seven banks have been reported to be joint global coordinators of the offering: Bank of America, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley.
A coalition of environmental groups – Rainforest Action Network, BankTrack, Earthworks, Friends of the Earth U.S., Global Witness, Indigenous Environmental Network, Oil Change International, ShareAction, Sierra Club and 350.org – have written a letter to warn banks away from facilitating capital for the world’s largest corporate emitter of carbon dioxide. Also highlighted are the human rights concerns of banks’ raising billions of dollars for Saudi Arabia given the horrendous human rights record of the Saudi regime.

",Credit Suisse makes a step towards indigenous rights,Credit Suisse ,Switzerland,Dakota Access Pipeline ,energy distribution | oil and gas,United States,"
Today, the Society for Threatened Peoples (STP) and the Swiss bank Credit Suisse concluded a mediation process, facilitated by the Swiss National Contact Point (NCP), in the context of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Credit Suisse has resolved to incorporate the protection of indigenous communities’ rights into its internal guidelines on project financing. The STP welcomes this important step as a clear signal for the entire financial sector. However, it expects CS, as well as the other financial institutions, to extend this policy to all domains, such as company financing and stock broking. In addition, decisive action is expected in the event of breaches.
In April 2017, the STP filed a complaint against the Swiss bank Credit Suisse with the Swiss National Contact Point for the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. This was triggered by the fact that, at the time, CS was maintaining key business relations with the firms that built the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) in the USA. Thousands of indigenous people and water activists were protesting against the project because they feared the pipeline’s ecological risks. Unlike other banks, which partly withdrew from the project, CS never issued a public statement on the violent conflict around Standing Rock between the US authorities, the pipeline operators and the affected indigenous communities. Even the UN criticised the construction of the pipeline and the approval process.
Arbitration proceedings between the STP and CS began in spring 2018. As a result of this process, Credit Suisse agreed to incorporate the UN’s concept of “free, prior and informed consent” (FPIC) into its internal sector-specific guidelines on oil, gas, mining, forestry and agriculture, as well as to mention key components in its public summaries of these policies. In future, when financing projects that may have a negative impact on a region that is used or traditionally claimed by indigenous communities, CS will expect its customers to provide evidence that an amicable solution has been sought by means of active engagement with both the authorities and the affected indigenous communities, along the lines of FPIC.
“We welcome this improvement of the internal guidelines and acknowledge this as the bank’s first steps towards incorporating the rights of indigenous communities,” says Angela Mattli, campaign coordinator at STP. “At the same time, we note that CS is limiting its compliance with FPIC to project financing. Company financing and stock broking are excluded from these guidelines. The extension is therefore only a small step in the right direction when it comes to comprehensive protection of indigenous communities.” The Society for Threatened Peoples will monitor the implementation of the guidelines and expects CS to expand them soon, so as to include other business segments. CS is also expected to take decisive measures if the guidelines are not met.
The STP highly values the NCP as an accessible mechanism for mediating between companies and affected communities. At the same time, it wishes to emphasise that the OECD guidelines are not binding and that the NCP does not dispose of any means to impose measures. It should therefore by no means be understood as an alternative to the Responsible Business Initiative, which seeks to legally oblige companies to incorporate respect for human rights and the environment in all their business activities.

Melbourne, Australia ","NAB, ANZ and Westpac hit with climate risk shareholder resolutions",ANZ ,Australia,,,,"
Market Forces has lodged shareholder resolutions with NAB, ANZ and Westpac, calling on the three major banks to reduce their exposure to coal, oil and gas in line with the climate goals of the Paris Agreement.
The resolutions come after the major banks have continued to lend heavily to the fossil fuel sector, with exposures to coal mining and oil and gas extraction increasing alarmingly recently.
The resolutions ask for the banks to set targets to reduce exposure to fossil fuels in line with the Paris Agreement and will be voted on at the banks’ annual general meetings in December.
Commonwealth Bank did not receive a resolution after it produced an update to its environmental policy this year, committing to:

continue to reduce its thermal coal mining and coal-fired power generation exposures with a view to exiting the sector by 2030, subject to Australia having a secure energy platform. 
only providing banking and financing activity to new oil, gas or metallurgical coal mining projects if they are in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement.

Visit the Market Forces website to take action and to tell ANZ, NAB and Westpac to get out of fossil fuels in line with the Paris Agreement.

Edinburgh, Scotland ",Civil society groups call on new CEO to make RBS banking sector ‘climate leader’,Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS)  ,United Kingdom,,,,"
Thirty-one civil society groups from around the world have sent an open letter to Alison Rose, the newly appointed CEO of the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), calling on her to turn the lender into a climate change leader by formally ending the bank's financial support for the coal, oil and gas sectors.
The groups also welcomed Rose’s appointment as the first woman to lead one of the UK’s ‘big four’ banks. The new RBS CEO is an advocate of gender equality, and has thrown light on the challenges faced by women in the banking sector as well as supporting women into business.
In their letter, the groups lay out the case for Alison Rose to take on another challenge when she takes over from the bank’s outgoing chief executive Ross McEwan on 1 November: to make RBS the “first major bank to formally end its financing for fossil fuels.”
The groups refer to the latest NGO analysis which shows that RBS financing of fossil fuel companies is now negligible, putting the state-owned bank in prime position to show real climate leadership by definitively ending its support for the sector. 
RBS decided in August to rule out financing for oil and gas drilling or exploration in the endangered Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a move which followed earlier announcements from the bank that it would no longer provide finance for coal mine, coal plant and tar sands projects.  However, RBS’s policy restrictions do not close off the possibility of future support for new conventional oil and gas projects or for all coal companies seeking to expand their activities.
RBS is one of 45 international private sector banks to have introduced policy restrictions on their coal financing, and one of a smaller group of banks which has introduced restrictions on tar sands and Arctic oil financing.  NGOs believe that RBS, which this week became a founding signatory of the UN’s Principles for Responsible Banking, can now go further than its peers and lead by example. 
Greig Aitken, Climate campaigner at BankTrack, said:
“RBS fossil fuel lending might be close to nothing in practice, but if this is not translated into necessary policy changes, the bank is keeping its doors open to potential new fossil fuel finance. As the climate crisis intensifies, and with growing global consensus that fossil fuel expansion has to end urgently, we’re hopeful that new CEO Alison Rose will see the business and sustainability case for ending the bank’s fossil fuel financing, and thereby position RBS as the climate leader in the banking sector.
“What’s more, Glasgow’s hosting of the UN Climate Summit in 2020 is the perfect opportunity for RBS to take swift, ambitious and very timely climate action.”
Ric Lander, Friends of the Earth Scotland, said:
“The burning of fossil fuels is the key driver of climate change. By publicly committing to stop financing the businesses who want to extract, produce or sell fossil fuels, RBS would send a clear message that they are serious about responding to the Climate Emergency. This would be a remarkable, positive transformation for an institution that marketed itself as 'the oil and gas bank' just over a decade ago.
“To ensure that we deliver the necessary climate action, we need our financial institutions to end their support for dirty energy and invest in a just transition to a zero carbon economy.”
Notes for editors:
1. The Banking on Climate Change Report 2019 analysed the financing from 33 private sector banks for 1,800 fossil fuel companies. It found RBS support for these companies dropping to $0 in 2018, from $3.7 billion in 2016 and $662 million in 2017. These values are based on the report’s methodology which considers if banks have lead transactions – lending or underwriting – to the fossil fuel companies in question. In 2018, RBS was found not to have led any such transactions, largely linked to the bank’s post-crash global retrenchment which now sees it focusing on customers in the UK and Ireland and western Europe.

Nine Sudanese victims, supported by the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and Project Expedite Justice, have filed a criminal complaint today targeting BNP Paribas for alleged complicity in crimes against humanity, torture, and genocide that took place in Sudan, as well as financial offences. This complaint marks the first attempt to hold the French bank criminally responsible for alleged complicity in international crimes committed in Sudan, and Darfur in particular. Between at least 2002 and 2008, BNP Paribas was considered to be Sudan’s “de facto central bank”. See FIDH for the full report.

","Revealed: major banks and investors including Barclays, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, BlackRock are pouring money into global forest destruction",Banco Santander ,Spain,,,,"


This includes some of the largest names in global finance—Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Santander and Standard Chartered among them— investing tens of billions of dollars into such companies.


In total, Global Witness identified more than 300 banks and investors funding businesses connected to forest destruction.


Money flowing through financial capitals like London, Berlin, Singapore and New York used to fuel companies destroying forests to produce products like palm oil, beef, and rubber. The NGO is urging policy makers to address the systemic failure of the financial system by introducing regulatory measures, including mandatory due diligence and reporting on environmental, social and governance risks, to curb this kind of damage. 


A new investigation reveals for the first time the epic scale of investment into global deforestation, by household name banks and major investment players.
The research, carried out by environmental and anti-corruption NGO Global Witness, reveals how a veritable A to Z of world finance is enabling the destruction of three of the world’s biggest rainforests.
Amongst those identified  are some of the largest names in global finance—Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Santander and Standard Chartered among them—providing tens of billions of dollars in financing between 2013-2019 to companies either directly or indirectly deforesting the largest rainforest regions of the world.
Five of the world’s leading investment banks, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Barclays and Morgan Stanley are also implicated. Global Witness wrote to each bank and received responses, which are referenced in the full report ‘Money to Burn’ available on request.
Six major agribusinesses causing this damage – which these well-known global financial players invest in – produce agricultural commodities like palm oil, beef, and rubber. 
Global Witness investigated these giant companies over six years (2013-2019), operating across the three largest single rainforests on earth – Amazon, Congo Basin and New Guinea - and found they were backed to the tune of $44 billion by over 300 investment firms, banks and pension funds headquartered across the globe.
The revelations in the report ‘Money to Burn’ come after a summer of international outcry over the burning of the Brazilian Amazon, and fresh from a week of strikes and climate action across the globe. Studies have shown that forests and other ecosystems could make up more than a third of the total carbon mitigation by 2030 needed to limit global heating to a 2-degree Celsius rise.
Yet in 2018 alone an area of primary tropical rainforest the size of Belgium was destroyed. About a quarter of forest loss, or as high as 78% in South East Asia and 56% in Latin America, was to make way for agricultural commodities, including beef and palm oil.
Ed Davey, Head of Forest Investigations, Global Witness said:
“The rapid breakdown of our climate is a concern to many – including bank customers – so it’s unsurprising that banks and investors proudly trumpet policies on ethical investment and lending, giving the impression they are not pumping money into companies that would fell and burn precious rainforests.
“But their hypocrisy is clear: the same financial institutions are breaking their own policies at will and in search of profit, make many of their promises barely worth the paper they are printed on.
“Members of the public will be shocked to know that the bank they have a current account with, that manages their pension fund or invests their retirement nest egg are enabling the destruction of the world’s most previous ecosystems.”
“$44 billion is a terrifying sum of money to be ploughing into companies that destroy forests – at a time when we need trees more than ever. These household name banks and iconic investment funds our exposé highlights will be familiar to anyone who has looked at the skyline of Wall Street or Canary Wharf, read a newspaper or opened a current account. But the activity in this report is just the tip of the iceberg.”
They are also urging policy makers to address the systemic failure of the financial system, and the companies it finances or invests in, to tackle deforestation by introducing regulatory measures, strengthening their existing commitments, and take meaningful measures to ensure they are implemented effectively.

New York, USA ",Civil society statement on the new Principles for Responsible Banking,,,,,,"
A statement from civil society organisations to mark the launch of the Principles for Responsible Banking  expresses significant reservations about what these new principles, and the banks signing up to them, are going to concretely deliver for people and planet.
As they launch today at the United Nations headquarters in New York, the Principles for Responsible Banking provide considerable leeway to signatory banks as to what is expected of them, and by when, which risks turning this initiative into yet another greenwashing tool that masks the destruction of the planet and egregious human rights abuses that are currently being fueled by much of the banking sector, including a significant number of the new initiative's signatory banks.
Calling for ""principles to have consequences"", the organisations maintain that:
""In order to truly align business strategies with the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Climate Agreement, we firmly believe that all Principles for Responsible Banking signatory banks must commit to immediately end all financing for fossil fuel expansion and activities driving deforestation or peatland destruction.""
The statement from civil society organisations also calls on all signatory institutions to commit to a 1.5°C compatible phase-out of financing for the fossil fuel industry and forest-risk commodity sectors, based on a comprehensive assessment of their financing impacts and full transparency of the companies and projects being financed. Furthermore, signatory banks must fulfill all requirements of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), including by establishing or participating in UNGP-compatible grievance mechanisms.

Nijmegen ","As the world goes on Climate Strike, private sector banks are urged to end fossil fuel financing",,,,,,"
To:  Fossil Banks, No Thanks! target institutions (namely, ANZ, Agricultural Bank of China, BBVA, BNP Paribas, BPCE/Natixis, Bank of America, Bank of China, Bank of Montreal, Barclays, CIBC, China Construction Bank, Citi, Commonwealth Bank, Credit Suisse, Crédit Agricole, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, ICBC, ING, JPMorgan Chase, KBC, MUFG, Mizuho, Morgan Stanley, NAB, Royal Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Scotland, SMFG, Santander, Scotiabank, Société Générale, Standard Chartered, TD Bank, UBS, UniCredit, Wells Fargo, Westpac)
Concerning:  Fossil fuel financing at your institutions, and its urgent, timely cessation
On September 20 and 27, millions of people will walk out of their workplaces and homes to join young climate strikers on the streets and demand an end to the age of fossil fuels.
Banks are in a unique position to support the youth of the world, whose futures are jeopardised by climate breakdown, and to act on the call from activists and scientists alike for urgent and drastic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.


By turning off the tap on the vast sums of money that currently flow to the fossil fuel industry, which is eating with such ferocity into the world’s remaining carbon budget, banks can send a powerful signal to the industry, to governments, and most importantly to the younger generation, that they will do what it takes to protect people, planet and the stable climate on which we all depend. At this crucial juncture, with emissions continuing, alarmingly, to rise, and climate impacts being felt everywhere but especially by the world’s most vulnerable communities, nothing less will do.

Exiting the fossil fuel industry


Avoiding a multi-degree rise in global average temperatures requires emissions to be halved by 2030 and to drop to zero by 2050. The phase out of fossil fuels must therefore begin immediately. As long as the fossil fuel industry keeps expanding, a full phase out will continue to be a distant prospect while the carbon budget rapidly shrinks. Taking climate change seriously and being committed to the Paris Agreement means that banks can no longer enable fossil fuel expansion. 


The Fossil Banks, No Thanks! campaign urges all banks to immediately end their financial support for new fossil fuel projects and for companies continuing to expand their fossil fuel operations.


But ending finance for fossil fuel expansion is only the first step towards exiting this climate-wrecking industry.
Banks must also plan for their own total phase out of fossil fuels from their portfolios. In June, French bank Crédit Agricole showed how this can be done for thermal coal with a new policy commitment which includes a clear timeline to exit the sector entirely by 2030 for EU and OECD countries, 2040 for China and 2050 for the rest of the world. 


A rapid coal phase out approach must now be adopted by other banks and replicated for the oil and gas sectors.

The Climate Strikes are just the beginning


2019 has seen a dramatic increase in public awareness and concern about the climate crisis. The momentum of the youth climate strikers as well as groups like Extinction Rebellion is growing and spreading around the world. Ever more campaigners and activists are turning their attention to the financial sector as a key factor in determining whether or not the fossil fuel industry can continue its assault on the climate. 
In his historic article for The New Yorker published this week ('Money is the oxygen on which the fire of global warming burns'), American environmentalist, author and journalist Bill McKibben wrote: 
""It’s possible to imagine  industries, given that the world is now in existential danger, quickly jettisoning their fossil-fuel business. It’s not easy to imagine—capitalism is not noted for surrendering sources of revenue. But, then, the Arctic ice sheet is not noted for melting.""


The increasing scrutiny of the relationship between financial institutions and the fossil fuel industry means that banks can no longer tout their green investments while continuing to provide billions of dollars in fossil fuel finance every year. It is the responsibility of banks to keep people’s investments and money safe. As important, however, is for banks to use that money in the long-term interest of their customers, not simply in the short-term interests of shareholders and senior management. 


It is therefore wantonly perverse for banks to hold the money of younger generations, for whom the stakes are increasingly existential, only to allow that money to contribute towards the destruction of their future.


With the 25th UN Climate Summit (COP25) on the horizon, we urge banks to take the ambitious, rapid action to exit the fossil fuel industry as demanded by this crisis.
Sincerely, Johan Frijns, Director, BankTrack

Berlin ",NGOs release updated Global Coal Exit List for finance industry,,,,,,"
The day before the Global Climate Strike, Urgewald and 30 partner NGOs have released a new update of the Global Coal Exit List (GCEL), the world’s most comprehensive database of companies operating along the thermal coal value chain.

NGO research: Majority of coal companies still on expansion course
Many coal plant developers missed by financial institutions’ exclusion policies
Investors representing US$ 10 trillion now using GCEL’s divestment criteria

“Our 2019 data shows that the time for patient engagement with the coal industry has definitely run out,” says Heffa Schuecking, director of Urgewald.
While the world’s leading climate scientists and the United Nations have long warned that coal-based energy production must be rapidly phased out, over 400 of the 746 companies on the GCEL are still planning to expand their coal operations.
“It is high time for banks, insurers, pension funds and other investors to take their money out of the coal industry,” says Schuecking.
The GCEL was first launched in November 2017 and has played an influential role in shaping the coal divestment actions of many large investors, especially in Europe. Over 200 financial institutions are now registered users of the database and investors representing close to US$ 10 trillion in assets are using one or more of the GCEL’s divestment criteria to screen coal companies out of their portfolios.
The database covers the largest coal plant operators and coal producers: companies that generate over 30% of their revenues or power from coal and all companies that are planning to expand coal mining, coal power or coal infrastructure.
According to ET Index research: “The Global Coal Exit List produced by Urgewald is an excellent tool for understanding asset stranding and energy transition risks. The tool provides one of the most comprehensive and in-depth databases for coal generation and expansion.”
And the Insurer Zurich says: “The GCEL is a valuable input to implement our coal policy on the insurance side as it is the only data source that also assesses private companies.”
Overview of the 2019 GCEL
The database provides key statistics on 746 companies and over 1,400 subsidiaries, whose activities range from coal exploration and mining, coal trading and transport, to coal power generation and manufacturing of equipment for coal plants. Most of the information in the database is drawn from original company sources such as annual reports, investor presentations and company websites.
All in all, the companies listed in the GCEL represent 89% of the world’s thermal coal production and almost 87% of the world’s installed coal-fired capacity.
New coal plants totaling over 579 GW in the pipeline
While the global coal plant pipeline shrank by over 50% in the past thre years, new coal plants are still planned or under development in 60 countries around the world. If built, these projects would add over 579 GW to the global coal plant fleet, an increase of almost 29% to the 2,026 GW of coal-fired capacity currently installed globally.
The 2019 GCEL identifies 259 coal plant developers. Over half of these companies are not traditional coal-based utilities, and are therefore often missed by financial institutions’ coal exclusion policies. Typical examples are companies like the Hong Kong based textiles producer Texhong – which plans to build a 2,100 MW coal power station in Vietnam – or very diversified companies, like Japan’s Sumitomo Corporation, which is developing new coal plants in Bangladesh, Vietnam and Indonesia.
Kimiko Hirata from the Japanese NGO Kiko Network notes, “All five of Japan’s largest trading houses are on the Global Coal Exit List as they are still building new coal-fired capacity either at home or abroad.”
One of the most unexpected coal plant developers is the Australian company Shine Energy, which describes its mission as “helping Australia transition to a renewable future.” At the same time, Shine Energy is planning to develop a 1,000 MW coal power station “to return one of North Queensland’s oldest coal mining towns to its former glory,” as reported in the Australian media.
Coal mining and coal infrastructure expansion
Over 200 companies on the GCEL are still expanding their coal mining activities often in the face of enormous resistance by local communities. While some large coal miners such as South32 have begun offloading their thermal coal assets, most of the world’s largest coal producers are still in expansion mode.
Out of the 30 companies which account for half of the world’s thermal coal production, 24 are pursuing plans to still increase their coal production. Glencore, the world’s eigth largest coal producer, was recently applauded by climate-concerned investors for agreeing to set a cap of 150 million tons for its annual coal production. This still leaves plenty of space for a production increase: Glencore’s 2018 coal production was 129 million tons.
In many regions of the world, the development of new coal mines is dependent on the development of new coal transport infrastructure such as railways or coal port terminals. Thirty-four companies on the GCEL are identified as coal infrastructure expansionists. These include the Indian company Essar, which is building a coal export terminal in Mozambique, and Russia’s VostokCoal, which is building two coal port terminals on the fragile Tamyr peninsula in order to begin mining one of the world’s largest hard coal deposits in the Russian Arctic.
The fact that Adani Ports & Special Economic Zones – a subsidiary of the coal-heavy Adani Group – was able to recently raise US$ 750 million through a bond issue, shows that financial institutions still have a blind spot in regards to the role logistics and transport companies play in the expansion of the coal industry.
“Our research shows that the expansion of coal mining, coal transport and coal power all go hand in hand. If we want to avoid throwing more fuel into the fire, the finance industry needs to follow the example set recently by Crédit Agricole,” says Schuecking.
In its new policy announced in June this year, the French bank committed to ending its relationship with all clients that are planning to expand thermal coal mining, coal-fired power capacity, coal transport infrastructure or coal trading.
Conclusion
From Poland to the Philippines and from Mozambique to Myanmar, local communities are challenging new coal projects in the courts and on the streets. And on September 20th, millions of climate strikers from around the world are calling for an end to coal and other fossil fuels.
The Global Coal Exit List shows that the problem of dealing with coal is finite: 746 companies that the finance world needs to leave behind to make the Paris goals achievable.

Interesting facts & stats around the global coal industry
Companies
Out of the 746 parent companies listed on the GCEL, 361 are either running or developing coal power plants, 237 are involved in coal mining and 148 are primarily service companies, which are active in areas such as coal trading, coal processing, coal transport and the provision of specialised equipment for the coal industry. The numbers are based on companies’ primary role in the coal industry. Many companies on the GCEL are active in two or even all three of these categories.
The four countries with the most coal companies are China (164), India (87), the United States (82) and Australia (51).
The world’s largest thermal coal producer is Coal India Limited. Last year, the company produced 534 million tons, accounting for 8% of world thermal coal production (according to the IEA, world thermal coal production was 6,780 Mt in 2018). The second largest coal producer was China Energy Investment Corporation with 510 million tons.
Twenty-seven companies account for half of the world’s installed coal-fired capacity. The largest coal plant operator worldwide is China Energy Investment Corporation with 175,000 MW installed coal-fired capacity.
The world’s largest coal plant developer is India’s National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC). It plans to build 30,541 MW of new coal-fired capacity
One of the largest equipment providers for the coal plant pipeline is General Electric. It is involved in the construction of new coal plants in 18 countries, out of which half are frontier countries, with little or no coal-fired capacity as of yet.
Another important manufacturer and EPC contractor is Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction from South Korea. Doosan Heavy is involved in at least eight coal power plants totalling 10,9 GW under construction in South Korea, Indonesia, Vietnam and Botswana.
Countries
Plans for new coal plants threaten to push 26 “frontier countries” into a cycle of coal-dependency. Out of these 26 countries, 15 have no coal-fired capacity as of yet and 11 have 600 MW or less.
The ten countries with the largest coal plant pipelines are: China (226,229 MW), India (91,540 MW), Turkey (34,436 MW), Vietnam (33,935 MW), Indonesia (29,416 MW), Bangladesh (22,933), Japan (13,105 MW), South Africa (12,744 MW), the Philippines (12,014 MW) and Egypt (8,640 MW).
In the European Union, the country with the largest coal power expansion plans is Poland (6,870 MW). Out of 23 companies, which have coal mining expansion plans in Europe, seven are expanding in Poland and nine in Turkey. In both countries the opposition against new coal projects is strong. Villagers from Turkey’s Muğla region are protesting against the plans of Bereket, IC Holding and Limak Energy to extend the lifetimes of polluting coal plants and expand the area’s lignite mines.
Japan is the country with the highest percentage of coal power expansion projects overseas. Out of 30 GW of coal-fired capacity planned by Japanese companies, 51% are being developed abroad.
The country with the largest absolute coal power expansion plans abroad is, however, China. Chinese companies are planning to build new coal plants totalling 54 GW in 20 countries. These account for 24% of the total coal power capacity being developed by Chinese companies.
Out of 99 coal companies operating in Indonesia, 63 are headquartered overseas.
Financial institutions
In August 2019, Indonesian citizens filed a court case in South Korea, asking for an injunction to prevent South Korea’s financial institutions from financing the construction of two new coal power plants near Jakarta.
In spite of its new “climate speak”, BlackRock is the world’s largest institutional investor in coal plant developers. In December 2018, it held shares and bonds in value of over US$ 11 billion in these companies.
In June 2019, The Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global took a further step down the coal divestment path by excluding all companies, which operate over 10 GW of coal-fired capacity or produce over 20 million tons of coal annually. The Pension Fund now applies two of the three GCEL criteria to its portfolio. Its total coal divestment since 2015 is estimated to be around € 9 billion.
Twenty-six commercial banks have committed to no longer participate in project finance deals for new coal plants. Nine major banks have also committed to ending corporate finance for clients whose coal share of revenue or coal share of power generation is above a designated threshold.
Philippine NGOs have just launched a campaign to move the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) to also stop financing coal.
Sixteen insurers have ended or severely restricted underwriting for coal projects. Reinsurers representing 45% of the global reinsurance market have taken significant coal divestment steps.
The first financial institutions have begun announcing dates for a complete phase-out of coal from their investments. Among these are, for example KLP, Storebrand, Nationale Nederlanden, Allianz, Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Crédit Agricole.

",Massive forest fires and haze in Indonesia create public health and climate crisis,ABN AMRO ,Netherlands,APRIL ,forestry - pulp and paper,Indonesia,"
In Indonesia, massive forest fires have been burning for weeks, and drained peatlands having been smoldering, causing large Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and a toxic haze that spreads as far as Singapore and Malaysia. The causes are complex, but among them are links to the past, present and future of pulp and paper. Analysis of satellite images by Eyes on the Forests of 7,205 hotspots, found that almost nine percent of these were located in APRIL concessions. APRIL is a large Indonesian pulp and paper company. APRIL’s poor progress in implementing Indonesian government regulations on peat protection and restoration exposes its financiers to reputational and financial risk. Among its financiers are ABN AMRO (Singapore), Bank of Shanghai, Bank SinoPac, China CITIC Bank, China Everbright Bank, Chiyu Banking Corporation, DZ Bank Singapore Branch, First Abu Dhabi Bank Singapore, ICBC (ASIA), ICICI Bank - Hong Kong Branch, Industrial & Commercial Bank China, Intesa SanPaolo Spa-HK Branch, KEB Hana Bank, MUFG Bank, National Bank of Kuwait SAK, Shanghai Commercial & Savings, State Bank of India (Singapore), Taishin International Bank, Taiwan Business Bank, Taiwan Cooperative Bank, Land Bank of Taiwan and Yuanta Commercial Bank. These were late last year part of a larger syndicate that provided APRIL with a USD 835 million loan. 
Thousands of schools have been shut across Sumatra and Indonesian Borneo due to air pollution from the forest and peat fires. Indonesian authorities closed an airport on Sumatra island on Friday due to poor visibility caused by smoke. In the province of South Sumatra alone, officials reported 32,000 cases of respiratory tract infections in the last five weeks, almost half of them under the age of five years old. Startling images and videos of the burning of forest and land have been seen around the world.
“The current situation in Riau is sad and depressing,” said Woro Supartinah, a resident of Pekanbaru in Riau Province in Sumatra, and a Steering Committee member of Environmental Paper Network International. Ms. Supartinah reports that the air quality has been extremely unhealthy. Measurements of particulate matter in the air have been drastically above safe levels. Recorded levels in Riau of PM10 (particles with a diameter of 10 micrometers or less, and able to reach deeper in the respiratory tract) have vastly exceeded safe levels of under 150 micrograms per cubic meter, reaching all the way to levels of almost 450 micrograms per cubic meter on 19 September. Estimates are that from January to September 2019 more than 300,000 people have suffered from acute respiratory infection in Riau. “In just my city, 721 schools have delayed learning and activities due to the haze situation, impacting more than 190,000 students in Pekanbaru alone. The ultimate and the most saddening impact of the forest fires and the haze is that it now has been taking lives of young children. It has been reported that a baby just three days old has died from respiratory problems yesterday.”
Fires have reportedly spread into the Padang-Sugihan Wildlife Reserve in South Sumatra, one of the last strongholds of the Sumatran elephant. In Kalimantan, the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation said on Tuesday that the haze was severely affecting hundreds of great apes in its care, as well as the rescuers, at their rescue centres and wildlife re-introduction shelters.
The climate implications are extraordinary. As Mongabay notes, the fires are a disaster for Indonesia’s commitment to curb its carbon emissions. Nearly 3,400 square kilometers of forest have been burned in the first eight months of the year, according to official figures. The burning has resulted in the release of nearly 110 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent into the atmosphere which is equal to almost half of Indonesia’s annual emissions between 2006 and 2016. The fires are affecting international relations with Indonesia’s neighbors. The transboundary haze is once again increasing diplomatic tensions between Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur. Malaysia’s environment minister, Yeo Bee Yin, has shared data publicly challenging her Indonesian counterpart, Siti Nurbaya Bakar, on her denial that the haze in Malaysia is coming from Indonesia.
The Indonesian civil society coalition, Eyes on the Forest, analysed the satellite data from NASA's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite, looking for fires in the categories of nominal and high confidence, finding 7,205 hotspots occurring in the first week of September in Sumatra. While the majority of the hotspots (5,405) were in non-concessions areas, there are still 1,649 hotspot originating from Industrial Timber Plantations concessions (Hutan Tanaman Industri in Bahasa). The pulp and paper industry in Indonesia has extensive tree plantations on drained peatlands. To produce acacia pulpwood or other commodities, water must be drained from the wet peatland soil to a depth of around 70 centimetres using drainage canals. Drained and dried peat is particularly prone to fire, is hard to extinguish and produces massive amounts of haze as it burns. The analysis by Eyes on the Forest found 637 hotspots originating in APRIL's concessions, and 162 in Asia Pulp and Paper's concessions, while further hotspots were located in 850 as area of PT. A number of 151 hotspots were found in palm oil plantations. Most of the hotspots are located in peatlands. For further information, please see this map.


In August, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry said they had put a police line on 19 companies of palm oil plantations and pulp and paper suppliers in five provinces due to their concessions raged by fires. In Riau this includes pulp and paper companies PT RAPP (APRIL), PT AA (APP), PT SRL (APRIL), and the palm oil company, PT GSM. Just recently, the number of sealed off companies has been reported at 30. As reported by ABC News, the law enforcement director at Indonesia’s Forestry and Environment Ministry, Sugeng Riyanto, said the plantation companies, including a Singapore-based company and four firms affiliated with Malaysian corporate groups, are under scrutiny and waiting for decisions on possible punishment. Yeo Bee Yin has expressed support for these investigations, and the Malaysian government is considering a law that allows it to take action against Malaysian companies operating overseas that are found guilty of contributing to the haze.
Could pulp and paper companies and the government be doing more to address the legacy of the industry on peatlands, and its contribution to the fire crisis? After drainage, the peat oxidizes, releasing carbon in the form of CO2 into the atmosphere. Even without fires, the release of CO2 from an acacia plantation on peat has been identified by a scientific field study as around 80 tonnes per year per hectare. As a result, drained peatland contributes more than half of Indonesia’s Greenhouse Gas emissions, which in addition to above-ground deforestation emissions, puts Indonesia among the world’s highest GHG emitters.
A new investigative report by Eyes on the Forest, published in August, found that the government is rewarding paper giants in Indonesia for a lack of action to restore peat in their vast empires. The objective of the monitoring was to evaluate the pulp and paper giants, Asia Pulp & Paper/Sinar Mas Group and APRIL/Royal Golden Eagle Group, and the Ministry of Environment and Forestry’s own compliance with and progress in implementing Indonesian government regulations on peat protection and restoration.
To create transparency on the issue and evaluate the restoration performance by both Hutan Tanaman Industri (HTI) concession holders and government in the country’s top peat province of Riau during the past three years, Eyes on the Forest surveyed HTI concessions with drones and on the ground between July and December 2018. The HTI concessions surveyed covered 12% (149,142 hectares) of the peatlands mapped as Protection Function Peat Ecosystems (FLEG) by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry inside concessions affiliated with APP/SMG and APRIL/RGE. The concessions surveyed also covered six percent (167,810 hectares) of all FLEG areas in Riau Province, which has the largest area of FLEG in the country.
In summary, Eyes on the Forest found:

Poor efforts made by APP/SMG and APRIL/RGE affiliates to restore peatlands zoned for protection by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry and/or Peat Restoration Agency in some of the concessions investigated;
Alleged violation of Minister of Environment and Forestry Regulation P16/2017 by all four APP/SMG and APRIL/RGE affiliated companies in all except one HTI concessions investigated by way of replanting acacia after harvesting the old plantation instead of restoring the peatlands with native species as required;
Alleged violation of Government Regulation number 45 - Year 2004 Article 8.2 on Forest Protection by an APRIL/RGE affiliate (PT Sumatera Riang Lestari) for not protecting the HTI concession area from planting of oil palm plantations by outsiders (the local community, investors, land speculators);
Apparent lack of government supervision of these companies for non-compliance with government regulations;
Lack of restoration efforts by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry in one concession for which the Ministry had revoked a license in 2016.

The impacts of forest and land burning on the climate, public health, endangered wildlife and livelihoods of forest communities in Indonesia is a global tragedy. Fires, exacerbated by what has already been a dry year, are expected to worsen during the peak of the dry season in October. It is clear that much more must be done by government, the pulp and paper industry, and the palm oil industry as well, to restore and protect tropical peatland and to stop burning on the land concessions of companies.

","Advocates urge International Olympic Committee to prioritize climate action, highlight hypocrisy of touting “sustainable” Tokyo Olympics while Japan finances new coal",Mizuho Financial Group ,Japan,,,,"
As leaders of the UNFCCC’s Sports for Climate Action Framework prepare to gather at the International Olympic Committee’s headquarters in Lausanne on September 18th, 25 civil society organizations from 14 countries have written to IOC President Thomas Bach expressing concern over the health and safety of athletes and fans at next year’s Tokyo 2020 Olympics, and urging him to use his platform “to encourage Olympic host cities and governments, such as Japan, to take urgent action to address the climate crisis.” 

“The climate emergency we are in is threatening global health and safety, undermining livelihoods and food supplies and disrupting economies. This crisis is also now endangering the long-term viability of the Olympic Games,” reads the letter.
Groups expressed concern with intense heatwaves in July that hospitalized tens of thousands and killed at least 50 people in Japan, including a worker at an Olympic construction site. This year’s heatwave follows a deadly heat wave in Japan in the summer of 2018, which, according to research by the Japan Meteorological Agency, “would never have happened without anthropogenic global warming.”
The organizations highlight the hypocrisy of promoting a “sustainable” Tokyo 2020 Olympics while the Japanese government and several major Olympic sponsors continue to finance new coal-fired power projects, locking in decades of new emissions. 
Four new coal-fired power plants are expected to begin operation in Japan next year when the Olympics kicks off. 
Internationally, the Japanese government spends $5 billion a year supporting coal mining and coal power production in other countries.  In the past few months, the Japanese government has approved $2.5 billion in loans for the Matarbari coal plant in Bangladesh and for the Van Phong 1 coal plant in Vietnam, which Greenpeace estimates will lead to 2,970 premature deaths due to air pollution. Japan’s continued government support for coal runs counter to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres’ call for an end to new coal-fired power plants after 2020.
Three of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Gold Sponsors are major backers of coal. Japanese megabanks Mizuho and SMBC are among the world’s largest lenders to coal developers globally and are the biggest lenders and underwriters to coal developers in Japan. Olympic sponsor Tokio Marine is one of the world’s leading power and energy sector insurance companies and has recently come under fire for its financial support of coal projects. 
Susanne Wong, Senior Campaigner of Oil Change International, says, “Behind the high-tech veneer of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, the Japanese government and Olympic sponsors like Mizuho, SMBC and Tokio Marine continue to promote dirty and outdated coal technology that is fueling the climate crisis.”
Notes to editors:


Full text of letter to the IOC 


The Sports for Climate Action Framework was launched by the UNFCCC and sports organizations in December 2018 to “raise awareness and action to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.” The IOC was a founding signatory. Tokyo 2020 Olympics joined the initiative the day after it was launched.


Signatories are gathering for the first time in Lausanne on September 18, 2019. Sports for Climate Action signatories will meet once a year to look at the progress made with principles. This first meeting will be used to kick off work to develop roadmaps for adhering to the principles.

",Bank workers: Join the Global Climate Strike! ,,,,,,"
As climate impacts across the world intensify, wrecking our communities with  unprecedented violence, climate change is no longer a threat the financial sector can ignore. The continued extraction and burning of fossil fuels is driving us further into climate breakdown, and our governments and institutions are failing to take the required level of action to address the crisis.
Banks are playing a massive role in fueling the climate crisis, with over $1.9 trillion poured into climate-wrecking fossil fuel projects and companies by 33 big banks across the world since the signing of the Paris Agreement. This support for the fossil fuel industry by banks must stop.
In the midst of this inaction, young people across the world have been organising and building a strong movement calling on decision-makers to do much, much better to address runaway climate change. BankTrack has been deeply inspired by the energy, dedication and passion shown by young people across the world taking a stand for climate justice. This September we want to stand in solidarity with the Youth Strikers and support their actions.
This is why from September 20 to 27, BankTrack will be joining and supporting events organised and led by the Youth Strikers.
We call on all bank workers who see the crisis we are in, whose children may already be climate activists, to join the Global Climate Strike or support it in whatever way they can. Bank employees, by disrupting business as usual, can show decision-makers at banks that there is support among their workforce for strong climate action, and for banks to play their role in ending the age of fossil fuels.
We further call upon all banks that are genuinely committed to the fight against climate change to follow the example of German ethical bank GLS, and close their doors on September 20 to allow their workers to join the strike and demand climate justice. 
It is clear that continued bank support for the fossil fuel industry is incompatible with reversing the climate catastrophe. Banks must take action to stop this support, starting with ruling out all new lending for new oil, gas and coal projects. Our house is on fire, and the Global Climate Strike provides bank workers with an ideal opportunity to demand their employers stop adding fuel to the fire.

Many of the same groups behind the call for a ""Global Day of Action for the Amazon"" on September 5th have issued a set of demands for the private sector to take responsibility for its pivotal role in the forest destruction unfolding across South America that has captured the attention of the world.
The rapidly growing coalition of groups, which includes Friends of the Earth, Amazon Watch, Rainforest Action Network, and others, issued the following statement about the corporate actors involved in Amazon rainforest destruction:
""Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro certainly deserves the primary blame for the fires currently burning in the Amazon, given his violent, regressive, and racist policies and his explicit encouragement to ‘open the Amazon for business'.
""But multinational corporations helped create these conditions for profiteering at the expense of the lungs of the earth – and these same companies are poised to profit further as today's fires open up the door for tomorrow's plantations and ranches.""

In a communique titled An Open Letter from Civil Society to the Global Finance Community, (also signed by BankTrack), we declare ""The fate of the Amazon is the fate of the world. Today we call on you, the banks and institutional investors that provide debt and equity financing, to use your money, which in many cases is our money, to directly challenge Bolsonaro's destructive agenda in Brazil. We call on you to immediately suspend all financing to agribusiness firms active in the Brazilian Amazon and the Cerrado until and unless you can take longer term, systemic actions to…"" resolve this crisis.
""Global commodity traders like Cargill, JBS and Mafrig are the key drivers of deforestation in the Amazon. Their products are then sold by retailers like Leclerc, Stop Shop, Walmart and Costco. And behind the commodity traders stand the banks and institutional investors providing the credit and equity financing that enables their expansion into the Amazon: firms like BlackRock, JPMorgan Chase, Santander, BNP Paribas, HSBC and others. These financiers not only enable the destruction of our forests – they profit from it.
""The crises facing the Amazon require innovative solutions that address the root of the problem. The stakes are simply too high to accept half measures or surface-level solutions. It is time to name names: to identify the worst actors operating in the Brazilian Amazon, as well as the global companies and financial institutions that enable them, and to demand immediate reform and accountability on the part of the Bolsonaro regime.
""Global solidarity with Brazil's movement for social and environmental justice is more critical now than ever. While we acknowledge the North's role in environmental mismanagement, human rights abuses, and climate change, we believe that through informed choices, the European and North American private sector and engaged citizens in the region can considerably influence the destructive agenda of the Bolsonaro government.""

",Civil society groups call for an accountability mechanism for the Equator Principles,,,,,,"
Seventy-nine civil society organisations and partners have submitted a joint statement to the Equator Principles Association (EPA) and signatory banks expressing disappointment that the current review process of the Equator Principles does not go far enough to strengthen accountability and ensure access to remedy. With the EPA currently revising the fourth iteration of the Equator Principles, the “EP4” review should be a moment of ambition for advancing accountability in project finance.
The Equator Principles is a risk management framework for determining, assessing, and managing environmental and social risks in project finance. It is currently adopted by 97 financial institutions, including private sector banks and several national export credit agencies, known as Equator Principles Financial Institutions (EPFIs). Currently, there is no requirement for EPFIs to establish accountability offices themselves or for the EPA to create a centralized accountability office to address grievances and harms relating to EPFI financing.
The joint statement calls upon the EPA to launch a formal process to develop an EPA-level accountability office to which project-affected people and other legitimate stakeholders can raise instances of alleged non-compliance with the Equator Principles. Establishing a central and independent accountability office at the initiative level is not only necessary for the Equator Principles to meet the standards laid out in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, but also to effectuate the Equator Principles’ intended role as a tool for improved due diligence, risk management, and continuous institutional learning.
The joint statement, coordinated by Accountability Counsel and BankTrack, was signed by 79 partners including Amazon Watch, BIC Europe, CEE Bankwatch, Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL), Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (SOMO), Greenpeace, Global Witness, Fair Finance Guide International, Inclusive Development International (IDI), International Corporate Accountability Roundtable (ICAR), International Rivers, Oxfam, Sierra Club, and Women's Earth and Climate Action Network International (WECAN).
The joint statement is a culmination of years of persistent advocacy by civil society groups to urge the EPA to recognize the importance of accountability for harm caused by EPFIs. As the Equator Principles is now undergoing a review process, the EPA has an opportunity to heed the calls of civil society and effectively ensure that problematic projects financed by EPFIs that result in environmental and human rights issues can be addressed through the creation of an accessible, centralized, independent accountability office at the EPA.

",Rio Grande Valley: Big banks urged not to back high risk fracked-gas export terminals,Bank of America ,United States,Rio Grande LNG Terminal ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,United States,"
More than 100 NGOs have written to a string of potential financiers of three fracked gas export terminals and related infrastructure projects proposed for the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas, calling on the institutions to turn down financing for Rio Grande LNG, the Rio Bravo Pipeline, Annova LNG and Texas LNG.
The institutions contacted include JPMorgan Chase, Société Générale, SMBC Group, Citi, Morgan Stanley, Mizuho, MUFG and Bank of America.
The projects in question, currently in their final permitting stages, but yet to reach Final Investment Decisions, would impact on local populations, violate Indigenous rights, wreck ecosystems and lock in decades of climate-killing greenhouse gas emissions.
Here we take a brief look at why these massive hydrocarbon export projects are stirring such opposition from South Texas communities and internationally. For a more detailed overview of these problems, see this July 2019 briefing.
The same amount of climate damage as 61 coal plants
If built, these LNG projects would liquefy and export 5.1 billion cubic feet of shale gas every day. This contradicts the goal of keeping global warming well below 2°C, and to aim for 1.5°C. Recent scientific research published in the journal Nature has concluded that a 1.5°C carbon budget does not allow for any new carbon-emitting infrastructure.
And yet, these three proposed terminals are poised to become major new sources of carbon emissions. Taking into account potential methane leakage and the energy-intensity of liquefying and shipping gas, the Rio Grande Valley’s LNG terminals would be doing the same annual climate damage as 61 coal plants. In addition, the construction of new export terminals provides a direct incentive to produce more shale gas through hydraulic fracturing across the state, which is also linked to widespread water contamination and community health impacts, in addition to the incompatibility of this production with a stable climate. 
Should any bank decide to support these projects, they would be flying in the face of any meaningful pledge to participate in the fight against climate change and in the transition to a low-carbon economy.
Habitats and wildlife under threat
The terminal sites would altogether cover 2,340 acres, including paving over hundreds of acres of wetlands and irreplaceable clay hills — called Lomas — surrounded by tidal flats which provide thickly vegetated wildlife habitat. Fourteen liquefaction trains, eight storage tanks, and hundreds of miles of new pipeline would be built for these three projects.
Moreover, the development and operation of the gas infrastructure, as well as the constant navigation of tankers shipping the gas across the ocean, would irrevocably scar an international wildlife corridor that includes the Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge and the Bahia Grande, one of the largest wetlands restoration projects in North America.
This development also threatens the endangered ocelot. A report published in May 2019 by the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services warned that one million species may be pushed to extinction in the next few years; supporting these projects would go against the common effort to tackle biodiversity issues.
Dire economic impacts
The proposed terminals would also have irreversible impacts on the local economy, degrading the fishing, shrimping and ecotourism industries, and threatening the livelihoods of thousands of people. In the Rio Grande Valley, nature tourism alone leads to 6,600 part- and full-time jobs.
An LNG terminal, on the other hand, creates mostly temporary construction jobs, and typically only a few hundred permanent jobs. The largest terminal proposed for the Rio Grande Valley would in comparison create only about 200 permanent jobs.
Serious violations of Indigenous rights 
Texas LNG would bulldoze the Garcia Pasture, a federally-recognised Indigenous site that is home to burial grounds and artifacts – and no archeological studies in the immediate construction sites of the other two terminals have been conducted. More archaeological and cultural data needs to be collected and assessed before any construction permits are granted.
These lands are sacred to the Carrizo Comecrudo Tribe, also known as the Esto’k Gna, who are the original people of the region, and who not only did not give their Free, Prior and Informed Consent for these projects to move ahead, but have not even been part of the companies’ consultation processes.
Local communities are rising up
Local people have made it clear that they oppose these destructive projects. Every community that would be impacted – South Padre Island, Port Isabel, Laguna Vista and Long Island Village – has passed anti-LNG resolutions. The school board has sided with the community and rejected tax breaks for the Rio Grande LNG and Annova LNG projects. Locals are challenging the permitting process every step of the way by taking legal action, sending thousands of comments to regulators and packing public hearings.
Major risks for banks 
All three of these proposed projects are subject to the Equator Principles, by virtue of their capital costs being well above  USD 10 million each. In light of the diverse and irreversible impacts detailed above, they appear to each be Category A projects – the highest risk category – and Equator Principles Financial Institutions should be aware that there is a strong argument that none of the three proposed terminals is compliant with the Equator Principles at all.
In the past years, two international investment banks have withdrawn from fracked gas LNG export terminals in the Rio Grande Valley: Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group ended its advisory mandate for the Rio Grande LNG terminal in 2016, and BNP Paribas ended its advisory mandate for the Texas LNG terminal in 2017.
Banks which choose to become involved in these fracked gas export projects face strong opposition and pressure from civil society, and any bank that chooses to get further involved must be ready to face the same reputational risks.
The institutions addressed by 105 NGOs from around the world must now refuse direct or indirect involvement in advising, investing, financing, arranging or otherwise facilitating the development of these projects in South Texas.

Berlin ","Occupied, annexed and cashed up",Commerzbank ,Germany,,,,"

German banks maintain financial relations with companies operating in occupied and annexed territories in the amount of € 44 billion.
Companies and banks neglect their human rights responsibilities and run the risk of participating in and benefiting from illegal settlement activities, from the destruction of infrastructure or from the exploitation of resources in occupied and annexed territories.
Deutsche Bank alone accounts for 45% of these financial relations, KfW is also concerned.
Only a few banks strictly exclude companies operating in occupied and annexed territories from their financial relations.
German companies such as Siemens, HeidelbergCement and DHL also attract negative attention in the study

A study published today in Berlin by the NGO Facing Finance documents 27 companies that operated in occupied and annexed territories (Western Sahara, Crimea and the Occupied Palestinian Territory) and thereby risk supporting acts that violate international law. In addition, the report identifies 15 German financial service providers and associated asset managers that provide €11.8 billion in loans, issued bonds in the order of €12.4 billion, holding shares worth €19 billion and bonds worth €1 billion in these companies. The supply of finance accounts for around 55% of the identified financial relationships, which demonstrates that German financial service providers do not only profit from business activities in occupied and annexed territories that contravene international law, but also foster them.
Deutsche Bank alone maintains financial relationships with the investigated companies amounting to more than € 20 billion, which accounts for more than 45% of all identified financial relationships (€ 44.4 billion) of German banks. The second largest lender of the companies surveyed is Commerzbank and the second largest investor is the state-owned KfW Bankengruppe, which, through the privatisation of Deutsche Post AG has become the largest shareholder in the companies surveyed. A glance at German banks’ guidelines shows that companies are often not subject to far-reaching requirements when it comes to their economic activities in occupied and annexed territories. To a certain extent, there are some exceptions to this for the EthikBank, GLS Bank, KD Bank, LBBW, Triodos Investment Management and Pax Bank.
“Not only enterprises but also their financial service providers must take international humanitarian law standards relative to the protection of people living in occupied and annexed areas into account”, claims Thomas Küchenmeister, Managing Director of Facing Finance, publisher and co-author of the study.
Violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights standards in this context include, amongst others, settlement activities, land grabbing, environmental pollution, the destruction of the occupied population’s dwellings, the exploitation of resources for the own benefit and to the disadvantage of the local population, as well as the incomplete fulfilment by an occupying power of its duties under international law to maintain order and provide for supplies. Collective penalties and the construction of barriers that restrict the freedom of movement of the population in occupied territories also consist of illegal activities.
The study concludes that companies and financial service providers that support such activities through their own business operations or through financings are complicit in these violations.
For example, numerous construction companies and manufacturers of construction machinery were implicated in the building of Israeli settlement structures in the occupied West Bank, in the construction of an illegal separation barrier, and in the destruction of Palestinian housing and other physical structures. The exploitation of natural resources in the West Bank and Western Sahara as well as the expansion of infrastructure in occupied territories are also considered violations of international law. Companies such as HeidelbergCement, Hyundai Heavy Industries, Caterpillar, Volvo Group, Siemens and Bombardier are complicit in these violations.
The study also criticises tourist activities such as “Caliber 3”, which can be booked via the TripAdvisor travel platform. There, a private Israeli “security academy” located in an illegal settlement in the West Bank trains and teaches tourists about their counter-terrorism fight against their Palestinian neighbours during a two-hour shooting experience.
In Western Sahara, which is occupied by Morocco, numerous international corporations also benefit from the exploitation of natural resources, mostly at the expense of the Sahrawi population. Siemens or Siemens Gamesa is for example participating in Moroccan wind power projects that take place in this region. International companies also import phosphate mined by Moroccan companies (e.g. Nutrien). Tourism companies (e.g. Booking.com) benefit from bookings on their travel portals of Moroccan offers in Western Sahara as well.
Despite international sanctions on the Crimean Peninsula, companies such as DHL and METRO have not completely discontinued their business activities according to current information available. With their services, they are undermining the sense and effectiveness of the sanctions imposed following Russia’s illegal annexation of the peninsula.
“Financial service providers must cease all financial relations with companies which, as part of their business activities, contribute to the development, maintenance and expansion of settlements in the occupied and annexed territories or participate in the exploitation and destruction of land and property,” says Thomas Küchenmeister. He points out that companies and their financial service providers even run the risk of criminal prosecution for complicity in war crimes.

Washington D.C. ","Ignoring Public Opposition and Significant Risk, Morgan Stanley Fails to Rule Out Support for Arctic Refuge Destruction",Morgan Stanley ,United States,,,,"
In a new policy statement released today, Morgan Stanley made minor updates to its criteria for financing fossil fuel projects but failed to rule out funding for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
Home to more than 200 species of wildlife, the coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge is one of the world’s last truly wild places. It is considered sacred to the Gwich’in Nation, who rely on the Porcupine caribou herd that migrates there for their food security and way of life. The Trump administration has pursued drilling on an accelerated schedule and plans to hold a lease sale in the coastal plain as soon as the end of this year. 
Earlier this week, Royal Bank of Scotland released updates to their own environmental policy explicitly ruling out support for the destruction of the Arctic Refuge, following similar commitments from other international banks including Barclays and National Australia Bank. Some of the world’s most significant institutional investors have also raised concernsabout the risks associated with Arctic Refuge drilling and urged companies and financial institutions not to invest there.
“Financial institutions around the world are recognizing the financial and reputational damage in store for any company involved in drilling in the Arctic Refuge, but Morgan Stanley has opted to leave themselves open to that backlash,” said Sierra Club Campaign Representative Ben Cushing. “Drilling in the Arctic Refuge would be a disaster for wildlife, the climate, and the human rights of the Gwich’in Nation, and any bank that supports this destructive activity will have the American public and major investors to answer to.” 
“It's disappointing that, despite hearing from the Gwich'in people about the existential threat drilling in the Arctic Refuge coastal plain poses to my people, Morgan Stanley refuses to commit not to fund the destruction of our sacred lands,” said Bernadette Demientieff, Executive Director of the Gwich'in Steering Committee. “Any bank that supports this destruction will have to answer to the Gwich’in and to the millions of Americans who stand with us. These are our homelands, and we will continue to stand against anyone who provides funding for the companies that would violate our human rights. We will not give up until this place is permanently protected.”

Melbourne, Australia ",Commonwealth Bank of Australia out of thermal coal by 2030,Commonwealth Bank ,Australia,,,,"
In today’s commitment, made in the bank’s new Environmental and Social Framework, to exit thermal coal by 2030, Commonwealth Bank has issued a stark warning to industry and policy-makers that coal has no place in Australia’s future.
Commonwealth Bank’s announcement follows recent commitments by insurers QBE and Suncorp to exit the thermal coal sector by 2030 and 2025, respectively. 
“Anyone planning to run a thermal coal mine or coal power station in Australia beyond 2030 must now contend with not being able to get finance from Australia’s largest financial institution or insurance from our two main underwriters,” said Market Forces Executive Director, Julien Vincent. 
“The exit of Australia’s largest company from coal should be a signal loud enough to be heard by the industry bosses and politicians who have their fingers in their ears over the need to decarbonise the economy,” said Vincent. “Now Australia’s other big banks need to step up and show the same kind of intent to get out of coal.”
Commonwealth Bank’s commitment means the bank will:

Continue to reduce its thermal coal mining and coal-fired power generation exposures with a view to exiting the sector by 2030, subject to Australia having a secure energy platform. 
Only finance new oil, gas or metallurgical coal mining projects if they are demonstrated to be compatible with the goals of the Paris Agreement. 
Not provide project finance for the mining, exploration, or development of oil sands, or for oil and gas exploration and development in the Arctic.

Commonwealth Bank’s policy reflects a dramatic turnaround from a bank that has lagged behind its peers on policy to restrict fossil fuel lending, and been one of the heaviest lenders to coal, oil and gas. 
In the two years following the Paris Agreement being signed, Commonwealth Bank loaned at least $7.2 billion to coal, oil and gas companies and projects. Many of these projects were new or expansionary, and would add another 2.9 billion tonnes of CO2 to the atmosphere over their lifetimes, enough to cancel out the gains made by Australia’s carbon reduction commitments three times over. 
More recently, Commonwealth Bank has issued loans to Australia’s three big coal power station operators Energy Australia, AGL and Origin, all of which intend to keep running coal power plants beyond 2030 and the latter having plans to massively expand gas extraction. 
“There is no doubting the significance of this announcement,” said Vincent. “Commonwealth Bank’s clients will need to think twice about whether they are going to have the support of the financial sector to run their businesses in a way that undermines the Paris Agreement on climate change.”
Market Forces is, however, calling on Commonwealth Bank to eliminate potential loopholes over financing new coal, oil and gas projects.
“The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states oil, coal and gas need to decline to meet the goals of Paris, and International Energy Agency (IEA) head, Fatih Birol, has said we can not afford to build any new CO2 emitting infrastructure,” said Vincent. 
“There’s no wiggle room. Commonwealth Bank should publicly recognise that under the Paris Agreement, there is simply no space to expand the fossil fuel industry, full stop.”

Edinburgh, Scotland ",Royal Bank of Scotland joins growing number of financial institutions rejecting Arctic Refuge drilling,Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS)  ,United Kingdom,,,,"
Today, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) released an updated Environmental, Social and Ethical (ESE) risk management framework that rules out financing for oil and gas drilling or exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
The new framework prohibits project-specific lending for “projects involving oil exploration and production operations in Arctic (including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge),” and restricts lending to any company that engages in these activities.  
This critical update to the bank’s lending policy follows similar announcements from other major international financial institutions including Barclays and National Australia Bank. Some of the world’s most significant institutional investors have also raised concerns about the risks associated with Arctic Refuge drilling and urged companies and financial institutions not to invest there. Over the last year, leaders from the Gwich’in Steering Committee and the Sierra Club have met with representatives from RBS to discuss the threats fossil fuel operations pose to the Arctic Refuge and why action by the financial industry is necessary. 
“As the Trump administration races to auction off the Arctic Refuge, major financial institutions are sending a clear message that companies should think twice before bidding,” said Lena Moffitt, Senior Director of the Sierra Club’s Our Wild America campaign.
“Drilling in the Arctic Refuge would be a disaster for wildlife, the climate, and the human rights of the Gwich’in Nation, and any company associated with this destruction will suffer long-lasting damage to their reputation. It’s no surprise that a growing number of banks want to stay as far away from this debacle as possible.” 
“Drilling in the Arctic Refuge would permanently destroy the primary food source of the Gwich’in people, our culture, and our way of life. The Trump administration may have made up their minds about selling off our sacred lands, but the fight is far from over,” said Bernadette Demientieff, Executive Director of the Gwich’in Steering Committee.
“We’re glad to see RBS recognize that the Arctic Refuge is no place for drilling and we hope that other banks, and the oil companies they finance, will follow their lead.”

Bangkok ","One year later, backers of collapsed Laos dam must be held accountable ",Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) ,Japan,,,,"
One year after the devastating collapse of saddle dam D of the Xe Pian-Xe Namnoy hydropower project in southern Laos, none of the entities backing and profiting from the project have been held accountable, according to a joint reportreleased today by International Rivers and Inclusive Development International.
“Reckless Endangerment: Assessing Responsibility for the Xe Pian-Xe Namnoy Dam Collapse” identifies the governments, corporations, banks and insurers that have backed the $1.02 billion project. The report sets out the responsibilities of these entities – from Korea, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and the United States – to ensure that the victims receive a fair and just remedy, as required under international human rights law.
The collapse on July 23, 2018, unleashed a wall of water that killed an estimated 71 people, displaced some 7,000, and damaged the homes and property of thousands more across the border in Cambodia. Nearly 5,000 Lao villagers made homeless by the disaster continue to live hand to mouth in squalid camps, their futures uncertain, according to field research conducted for the report. Survivors of the disaster are yet to receive any compensation for their lost villages, homes, land and property.
“We miss our homes, we miss our loved ones, and know we have lost everything. My body is tired. My mind is tired. I don’t know who will take responsibility for our loss,” said a woman who was swept away by the floodwaters and is now struggling to cope with the living conditions at the temporary camp.
A growing body of evidence suggests that the dam’s lead developer and builder, the Korean firm SK Engineering & Construction, may have caused the collapse. A Lao government-commissioned investigation has ruled out force majeure, or an unforeseeable “act of god,” as the cause of the disaster. A Stanford University researcher found that the dam’s reservoir was built on a sinkhole, while a document revealed by the Korean media indicates that SK Engineering & Construction lowered the height of the dam walls in order to save money and maximize profit.
The report reveals that the dam’s developers took out $50 million in liability insurance that affected people may be entitled to claim. This insurance is provided by the U.S. firm AIG and the Korean insurers Samsung Fire & Marine and Korean Re. Inclusive Development International and International Rivers are calling upon the developers and insurers to establish a compensation fund and claims process that is appropriate for Laos, which is a politically restrictive environment and lacks an independent and effective judicial system.
“It is outrageous that one year after the dam collapsed and unleashed so much destruction and suffering, the victims have still not been compensated. Meanwhile, there’s a $50 million pot of liability insurance that should be used for this exact purpose,” said David Pred, Executive Director of Inclusive Development International. “Each and every one of the State and corporate actors named in our report that enabled this disaster have a responsibility to repair the harm and help the affected families rebuild their lives.”
The joint venture that is developing the dam is composed of SK Engineering & Construction, Korea Western Power Company, Ratchaburi Electricity Generating Holding of Thailand, and the Lao government-owned Lao State Holding Enterprise. Ratchaburi was also the project’s construction supervisor, making it responsible for oversight of SK Engineering & Construction’s work. Four Thai banks provided approximately $714 million to finance the project: Krung Thai Bank, Ayudhya Bank (majority owned by Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group), Thanachart Bank and the Thai government’s Export-Import Bank of Thailand.
Construction of the 410-megawatt Xe Pian-Xe Namnoy project was 90% complete when one of the five auxiliary dams that reinforce the dam’s reservoir collapsed. Work on the project is reportedly again underway, despite ongoing safety concerns. 90% of the electricity generated by the project is intended for sale to Thailand.
The project is one of 352 hydropower dams under construction or planned for development in Laos, as the government seeks to transform the country’s economy through extensive hydropower development for export to neighboring countries. Scientists warn that these projects will cause enormous damage to the region’s rivers and ecosystems – and the people who depend on them for food and livelihoods.
“The dam collapse and its aftermath expose in stark terms the way in which projects like Xe Pian-Xe Namnoy are developed to benefit the companies that build and finance them, at the expense of the local people placed in harm’s way” said Maureen Harris, Southeast Asia Program Director at International Rivers. “This tragedy demands an end to business-as-usual and a commitment to building a development model that is just and sustainable for all.”

",New Report: Banks and Investors Should Avoid Supporting Rio Grande Valley LNG Projects,,,Rio Grande LNG Terminal ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,United States,"
Brownsville, TX — A new report released today highlights the reputational damage that would plague any bank or investor that supports three fracked gas export terminals proposed for Texas’ Rio Grande Valley.
Rio Grande LNG, Texas LNG, and Annova LNG and the Rio Bravo pipeline would liquefy fracked gas from the Eagle Ford and Permian shale basins for export through the Port of Brownsville. The combined impact of these three proposed projects would be devastating for the region, threatening Indigenous rights, community health, endangered species, and the global climate.
Already, pressure from activists raising these concerns convinced leading international bank BNP Paribas to step away from Texas LNG, and ultimately all fracked gas export terminals and pipelines. The report, released today by the Sierra Club, Rainforest Action Network, Friends of the Earth France, Save RGV from LNG, and the Carrizo Comecrudo Tribe, “Rio Grande Valley: At Risk From Fracked-Gas Export Terminals,” details the harms these proposed projects would do to the climate and local communities, and makes the case that other financial institutions should follow BNP Paribas’ lead and stay away or risk lasting reputational damage.
“These proposed LNG terminals have faced massive resistance from local residents because they would be an environmental disaster for our region, threaten local businesses, and trample Indigenous rights,” said Sierra Club Brownsville Organizer Rebekah Hinojosa. “The local movement fighting to protect our communities isn’t going away, and banks should think twice before being associated with these toxic projects.”
“At a time when science calls us to immediately and drastically reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, the fossil fuel industry plans to sacrifice a critical ecosystem to build a new climate bomb. This total nonsense has already been acknowledged by the second biggest European bank, BNP Paribas. We today ask all banks to do the same and commit not to support this disaster in the making,” said Lorette Philippot, Private Finance Campaigner with Friends of the Earth France.
“The proposed Rio Grande Valley fracked-gas export terminals would abuse Indigenous rights, threaten endangered species, hurt the local economy and help light the fuse to a massive carbon bomb. If built, they would be vulnerable to the very storms and sea-level rise they would exacerbate,” said Jason Opeña Disterhoft, Climate and Energy Senior Campaigner at Rainforest Action Network. “This report sends a clear warning to banks and investors of the risks they’re running if they support these projects. We urge them to stay away.”
“Texas LNG plans to destroy a pre-Columbian archaeological site called Garcia Pasture with the remains of our ancestors and villages. These pristine lands where the Rio Grande LNG, Texas LNG, and Annova LNG companies plan to bulldoze and spew toxic pollution are sacred to the Carrizo Comecrudo Tribe, and the companies did not consult with us,” said Juan Mancias, Chairman of the Carrizo Comecrudo Tribe of Texas.
“Our communities have time and time again told regulators we oppose the three LNG projects. We know we can’t count on FERC to protect the health and future of Rio Grande Valley communities, but banks and investors still have an opportunity to do the right thing. We’re calling on them to side with our communities and not support the Rio Grande LNG, Texas LNG, and Annova LNG projects,” said Josette Cruz, Save RGV from LNG Coalition.
All three projects are awaiting approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and local agencies. One of the three proposed projects, Texas LNG, has been set back at least a year by opposition from the city of Port Isabel.
Note: This report is being distributed to 37 top global bankers of LNG, and 31 top LNG investors:
Banks: JPMorgan Chase, Société Générale, SMBC Group, Citi, Morgan Stanley, Mizuho, MUFG, Bank of America, BNP Paribas, RBC, HSBC, Crédit Agricole, Goldman Sachs, ING, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Scotiabank, ICBC, Bank of China, Santander, BBVA, Unicredit, Deutsche Bank, UBS, BPCE/Natixis, Standard Chartered, Wells Fargo, China Construction Bank, CIBC, Bank of Montreal, Agricultural Bank of China, TD, RBS, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac, ANZ, and NAB (in order of amount of global LNG financing in 2016-8, per Banking on Climate Change 2019).
Investors: Bank of America, Bardin Hill, Blackrock, Capital Group, Crédit Agricole GRoup, Daiwa Securities, Deutsche Bank, Dimensional Fund Advisors, FMR, Franklin Resources, Geode Capital Management, Government Pension Investment Fund (Japan), Hanwha General Chemical, Invesco, JPMorgan Chase, Lyxor Asset Management, MUFG, Morgan Stanley, Nikko Asset Management, Nippon Life Insurance, Nomura, Norges Bank, Northern Trust, Schroders, State Street, T.

",SumOfUs Report Exposes French Insurer's Complicity in War Crimes,Bank Hapoalim ,Israel,i illegal settlements ,Construction | transport and infrastructure,Israel,"


International consumer advocacy group SumOfUs released a new report titled “AXA: Financing War Crimes” based on findings that the global insurer finances companies involved in the illegal Israeli occupation of the Palestinian Territory and the production of banned weapons. AXA previously stated that it does not finance activities nor companies subject to international sanctions, yet SumOfUs discovered that together, AXA and its affiliate AXA Equitable Holdings invests more than $91 million in the weapons manufacturer Elbit Systems and five of the largest Israeli banks, which all finance illegal Israeli settlements. 
On December 31, 2018, after several months of SumOfUs campaigning to pressure the global company, AXA Investment Managers (AXA IM) – AXA's subsidiary – sold all its shares in the arms manufacturer. Yet despite the sale, AXA remains linked to Elbit Systems through another affiliate AXA Equitable Holdings (AXA EQH). SumOfUs argues these investments may expose the company to criminal prosecution for complicity in gross human rights violations, including war crimes under both French and international law.
SumOfUs believes these investments put AXA at risk for several reasons. The insurer’s investments contradict its strict “Group Policy on Controversial Weapons ” that specifies it has taken steps to terminate business ties with manufacturers of cluster bombs, cluster munitions, chemical and biological weapons and/or key components thereof. Furthermore, the French government officially condemns “any knowing financial assistance, directly or indirectly, in the production or trading of cluster munitions” – and therefore French companies like AXA are beholden to adhere to the law. And finally, the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions bans the use, production, and financing of cluster munitions. 
The report by consumer watchdog SumOfUs also reveals AXA’s investments in Israeli banks directly finance illegal Israeli settlements. Reports by several NGOs confirm that all Israeli banks are involved in the Israeli settlement industry because they provide special loans for companies, governmental or individual projects in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.
“AXA can no longer continue to sweep the issue under the rug. The legal aspects, the figures, are accessible to all in this report,” said Leyla Larbi, Campaigner at SumOfUs. “Today, AXA must assume its responsibilities and adopt the appropriate behavior of a company that claims to be ‘proud of its responsible investment policy’” said Leyla Larbi. “The job of an insurer is to protect families, their homes and their property from life’s risks -- not to put people and homes at risk themselves.”

SumOfUs is a global movement of consumers, investors, and workers all around the world, standing together to hold corporations accountable for their actions and forge a new, sustainable and just path for our global economy.

Amsterdam ",Friends of the Earth groups and supporters file OECD complaint against ING for financing palm oil abuses,ING ,Netherlands,Socfin ,agriculture - non-food crops | agriculture - palm oil ,Luxembourg,"
Today, Friends of the Earth groups Milieudefensie (Netherlands), Sustainable Development Institute - SDI (Liberia) and Wahana Lingkungan Hidup Indonesia (Indonesia) filed a complaint at the Netherlands National Contact Point for the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises against the Dutch bank ING Group. The complaint concerns financing the palm oil companies Noble Group, Bolloré Group/Socfin and Wilmar International related to large-scale deforestation of tropical rainforest (Noble Group), land grabbing (Bolloré Group/Socfin) and child labor (Wilmar International).


The complainants demand that ING divest from these palm oil companies and the industrial palm oil sector as a whole. In addition, the organizations want the Dutch authorities to acknowledge that whilst the bank was aware of the harms, it did not act properly to address them and therefore contributed to the harms. They also call on the Dutch government to implement binding regulations for the financial sector. Dutch citizens are requested to support the campaign and reconsider banking with ING because of the environmental harm and abuse of human rights.
""We have been informing ING of the abuses in the industrial palm oil sector since the beginning of this century,"" said Evert Hassink, policy officer at Milieudefensie. ""But ING continued to finance these palm oil companies. The bank wants to engage with these companies and in this way seduce them into more sustainable choices. But after all these years it has become clear that this dialogue has yielded nothing substantial,"" said Hassink.
Oslan Purba, head of programmes at WALHI, says: “The industrial palm oil sector has been one of the main drivers of deforestation in Indonesia. The palm oil sector is using influence over the Indonesian government to protect their interests. Every Euro European financiers have been putting into rogue companies meant further expansion of plantations onto people’s lands and into forests. Illegalities in the palm oil sector undermine the impact of the Indonesian moratorium on the expansion of industrial activities into primary forests and peat areas.”
James Otto, programme manager at SDI, says that “Liberia is at the frontier of industrial palm oil developments in West Africa and our people are suffering from human rights violations. Workers’ rights and child labor are two of our concerns, and violations are systemic in the exploitative model of industrial palm oil production. The largest remaining forest areas of the Upper Guinea Forest face depletion if these companies continue to do business as usual.”

Misconduct

The complaint is supported by evidence on misconduct by three customers of ING:

The Noble Group is responsible for the deforestation of thousands of hectares of tropical rainforest in Indonesia.
Research and interviews with local communities in Indonesia and Liberia indicate that Wilmar International is involved in violations of labor rights, including child labor.
On Bolloré/Socfin plantations, various abuses have been documented in the area of human rights in Cameroon and Sierra Leone, including violations of land rights and the right to safety and privacy.


Consequences for ING

If the Dutch contact point upholds the allegations, this can have consequences for ING. It can be excluded from trade missions, subsidies and government support abroad. More importantly, it sets a precedent for other banks on how to comply with the OECD Guidelines and increases the chances that communities get redress. The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises clarify what governments expect from companies in the field of corporate social responsibility. They indicate how companies should deal with human rights, child labor, the environment and corruption.

Guidelines

The French and Belgium contact points for the OECD Guidelines have already established that ING customer, Socfin, did not comply with the Guidelines. Several other financial institutions have terminated their relationships with controversial palm oil companies, including the Noble Group. The Norwegian Government Pension Fund, for example, stopped financing no fewer than 33 different palm oil companies.  In the Netherlands insurance company Aegon divested completely from the palm oil sector.  Various other civil society organisations, including ReAct, Brot für alle, FIAN Belgium, CNCD-11.11.11 and FERN, support the filing of this complaint against ING by the Friends of the Earth groups.

",Duty of Care: Total served formal notice for its activities in Uganda,Standard Bank ,South Africa,East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,Uganda,"
This week four Ugandan campaign groups – AFIEGO, CRED, NAPE / Friends of the Earth Uganda and NAVODA – along with Friends of the Earth France and Survie filed a legal notification with the French oil and gas multinational Total concerning its oil extraction and infrastructure activities in Uganda. These activities include the USD 3.5 billion East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) which the company is developing, with financial assistance from commercial banks Sumitomo Mitsui of Japan and a Ugandan subsidiary of South Africa’s Standard Bank (see BankTrack’s Dodgy Deal profile of EACOP).
The groups have taken this first legal step following their assessment that Total has failed to address the human and environmental impact of its Ugandan operations as required by France’s Corporate Duty of Corporate Vigilance regulation. This is the first case in which this regulation, established in 2017, has been invoked in relation to the foreign activities of a subsidiary of a major French business group, and may lead to a formal court summons.
Total has been asked to:

Fill the gaps in its vigilance plan, which currently does not include any identification of risks or specific measures concerning its activities in Uganda, specifically the 1,445 kilometre EACOP project planned to run from Hoima in Uganda to the port of Tanga in Tanzania;
Implement effectively this vigilance plan, including the measures that Total already provides in documents related to its activities in Uganda.

As a result of this legal notification being served, Total has a maximum period of three months to comply with the requests of the organisations. If it fails to meet its obligations under the Corporate Duty of Corporate Vigilance regulation, victims can then bring the issue before a judge. 
A field survey into the EACOP project, carried out by the six organisations, has revealed that this mega project involves:


The expropriation of tens of thousands of people who have already lost their homes, their agricultural lands and their crops, in return for clearly insufficient compensation that they have been forced to accept often under pressure and intimidation;
Considerable risk to biodiversity and water resources, as the project is located largely within the Murchison Falls Nature Park, and includes a network of pipelines that will pass under the Nile and cross ecologically sensitive areas in a region with high seismic risk;
A clear impact on the climate, with a production of about 200,000 barrels per day, and the world's longest heated (electrified) pipeline for transporting oil over 1445 kilometres to the Tanga port in Tanzania.

Dickens Kamugisha, director of AFIEGO and present in Paris as the legal notification was issued, commented:
""The situation on the ground is dramatic, with thousands of people already deprived of access to their livelihood, and also tens of thousands of other people soon to be affected. It is very difficult for us to defend the rights of the people in the face of the injustices created by oil companies like Total who continue to associate with our government. Our judicial system does not allow us to oppose a giant like Total. The remedies we filed in Uganda against the state and other oil companies are failing, and NGOs like ours who challenge these economic interests have been attacked and threatened with closure by the government.""
The four Ugandan organisations which have taken part in the issuing of this formal notice to Total are keen to seize the opportunity granted under French law to defend their rights. For the groups involved, the challenge is to put an end to the impunity allowed until now due to the lack of a link of legal responsibility between a parent company and its subsidiaries, subcontractors and suppliers.
Further challenges have been experienced by the groups while conducting research (collection of information and testimonies) in Uganda. Those involved in the field investigations into the EACOP project, including a French national, have been harassed to prevent them from accessing the area concerned and to make contact with the affected populations. 
Nevertheless, the six organisations are determined to lead this legal battle and have asked for global support via a website launched for the occasion, totalautribunal.org.
Pauline Tétillon, co-president of Survie, explained: 
""Total, no stranger to exploitation in many African countries, hopes to develop a mega-oil project which would result in the eviction of tens of thousands of people and threaten serious environmental impacts in a natural park in the heart of the Great Lakes region. For us, it is absolutely clear that we have to try to prevent it.”
Juliette Renaud, Lead campaigner at Friends of the Earth France on multinational regulation, concluded: ""We have fought for years to achieve this binding law on multinationals in order to defend affected communities. Today a new judicial battle begins: Total must answer for its actions. This first case will be a real test to see if this law finally allows us to prevent human and environmental catastrophes.""

Nijmegen ",BankTrack 2019 Human Rights Benchmark: criteria and scope announced,ABN AMRO ,Netherlands,,,,"
BankTrack has written to 50 of the largest commercial banks around the world to give notice of its next human rights benchmark. In the coming months these 50 banks will be assessed on their implementation of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs).
The UNGPs were unanimously endorsed by the UN Human Rights Council in June 2011 and provide the clearest expression yet of the international community’s expectations of the human rights responsibilities of business. The Human Rights Benchmark aims to put a spotlight on whether banks are fulfilling theses responsibilities and to encourage progress towards their full implementation with the aim of preventing and mitigating adverse impacts to people.  
Banks will be assessed against 14 criteria across four categories assessing their human rights policies; due diligence processes; their reporting on human rights impacts; and approach to remedying adverse impacts. They will receive a full score (1), half score (0.5) or no score (0) for each category, leading to a total score of between 0 and 14.
The last time BankTrack produced the benchmark, in June 2016, over half of the 45 banks assessed were categorised as ‘laggards’, showing little or no evidence of conducting human rights due diligence. The report also highlighted eight banks as front runners, but identified several gaps that all banks were failing to address.
The 2019 update will expand the report’s geographic reach to include the largest banks in Africa, Russia and India. It will also include new criteria on whether banks report human rights indicators and whether they have a process in place to identify situations when they have caused or contributed to a human rights impact and have a responsibility to remedy the problem.
An overview of the assessment criteria and a list of the banks to be assessed is published here. The results will be published in November. 
Bank representatives from these 50 banks that have not heard from us are invited to contact us.

San Francisco, CA ",Citigroup cancels financing of Indonesian food giant Indofood over palm oil labor abuses,Citi ,United States,Indofood ,agriculture - palm oil ,Indonesia,"
Citigroup has canceled all financing to Indonesian food giant and agribusiness company Indofood (INDF:IJ) following the company’s ousting from the leading palm oil certification scheme, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). Indofood’s palm oil subsidiaries were dropped from the RSPO after failing to address over 20 violations of the RSPO standard, as well as 10 violations of Indonesian labor law, both of which were found on Indofood-owned palm oil plantations. Citigroup’s cancellation of US$140 million represents the loss of Indofood’s second largest source of funds from a Western bank. However, major Japanese, Indonesian, and European banks, as well as US brands such as Pepsico, continue to do business with Indofood.
“We are glad to see Citigroup enforce its policy and cut ties with Indofood, as this company has been flouting Indonesian laws, certification standards and international business norms for far too long,” said Hana Heineken, Senior Campaigner on Responsible Finance with Rainforest Action Network (RAN). “This should send a strong signal to Indofood’s remaining financiers and business partners that Indofood is a bad investment.”
The largest food company in Indonesia, Indofood has a market cap of 4 billion USD and is a core company of the Salim Group, which has the second largest oil palm land bank in Indonesia. The RSPO investigation of palm oil plantations operated by Indofood’s subsidiaries was sparked by a complaint against the company, brought by Rainforest Action Network (RAN), International Labor Rights Forum (ILRF) and Indonesian labor rights organization OPPUK in October 2016. Multiple investigations by RAN, OPPUK, and ILRF, as well as the RSPO and its accreditation body, confirmed the presence of exploitative labor practices –– including cases of child labor, unpaid workers, precarious employment, gender discrimination, and toxic working conditions.
“Indofood has allowed systemic labor exploitation to continue by ignoring RSPO’s warning. In fact, since the company left the RSPO, instances of intimidation and attacks against the independent union have escalated,” said Herwin Nasution, OPPUK Executive Director.
Japanese banks Mizuho Financial Group, SMBC Group, and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) are among Indofood’s largest lenders after Indonesian banks Bank Mandiri and Bank Central Asia. While the Indonesian bank policies are lacking, all three Japanese lenders recently adopted palm oil sector policies and have explicit prohibitions against financing illegal activity. Rabobank and Standard Chartered go further and require clients to be RSPO members, but both continue to finance Indofood. Rabobank recently announced its decision to pull financing from Indofood’s palm oil operations, but Indofood’s CEO Anthoni Salim continues to sit on the Food & Agribusiness Advisory Board of Rabobank Asia. Indofood’s top investors include Dimensional Fund Advisors, BlackRock, Vanguard, and the Government Pension Investment Fund of Japan, despite their claims to be responsible investors.
In April, 56 investors with approximately US$7.9 trillion in assets under management highlighted their support for the RSPO and called for all companies across the palm oil value chain, including banks, to adopt and implement a publicly available No Deforestation, No Peat and No Exploitation (NDPE) policy. The Japanese and Indonesian banks lack NDPE policies, and Indofood’s policy still falls short of the NDPE standard as well.
In the past 2 years, Indofood and its parent company First Pacific have lost 15 business partners due to Indofood’s controversial palm oil practices. These include Nestle, Musim Mas, Cargill, Fuji Oil, Hershey’s, Kellogg’s, General Mills, Unilever, and Mars. However, many companies still do business with Indofood and remain connected to its labor abuses, including joint venture partner PepsiCo and franchising partner Yum! Brands.
RAN, ILRF, and OPPUK continue to call on Indofood to address its ongoing labor violations, and adopt a comprehensive ‘No Deforestation, No Peatland, and No Exploitation’ policy that applies to Indofood, the entire Salim Group, and all third-party suppliers.
Indofood and its palm oil subsidiary Indofood Agri Resources were given an opportunity to comment on Citigroup’s cancellation of finance, but they declined to comment.

Paris, France ","Crédit Agricole gets real on coal, but oil & gas restrictions must follow, says BankTrack",Crédit Agricole ,France,,,,"
Today’s announcement by Crédit Agricole of a new climate strategy sees the bank introducing a significantly tougher and more restrictive approach to thermal coal financing and investing. The move has been welcomed by the commercial banking sector watchdog BankTrack, which has also called for other commercial banks to match or better Crédit Agricole’s improved approach to coal, and for the French bank to now start making urgent improvements to its financing policies for oil and gas.
Included in a range of new policy measures, to be applied across the entire Crédit Agricole group (financing, investments and asset management), Crédit Agricole has committed to stop all financing to companies still expanding their activities across the coal sector as a whole, covering producers, extractors, coal power plants and coal-related transport infrastructure.
Further, the bank has also laid out how it will now require its existing coal clients to provide by 2021 detailed plans for the closure of mines and power plants by 2030 in EU and OECD countries, by 2040 in China and by 2050 in the rest of the world.
Greig Aitken, coal campaigner at BankTrack, said:
“It has taken Crédit Agricole a few years to evolve its approach to coal and get it in line with the demands of the Paris Agreement, but this is an important step which the bank has taken today and introduces some urgently needed coal realism into the commercial banking sector.
“Too many banks are still unwilling to decouple themselves from the industry which is the number one biggest threat to the climate globally and which is now on economic life support. Crédit Agricole is to be congratulated for no longer messing about, and the stipulation that its coal clients must spell out how they intend to actually close their operations is crucial here.”
Claire Hamlett, leading the Fossil Banks, No Thanks! campaign on behalf of BankTrack, said:
“Crédit Agricole’s crack down on coal expansion and its insistence on meaningful coal phase out plans from clients is very encouraging. It’s a welcome first step from a bank in line with our Fossil Banks, No Thanks! demands that the commercial banking sector around the world has to introduce these measures not just for coal but also for oil and gas, otherwise the Paris Agreement will be up in smoke inside the next decade.
“However our research for the latest Fossil Fuel Finance Report Card shows that Crédit Agricole is still deeply involved in financing fossil fuels, including as one of the ten biggest financiers of dangerous Arctic and ultra-deepwater oil and gas drilling. Having made this positive step today on coal, we hope to see Crédit Agricole keeping up this momentum by similarly clamping down on its heavy oil and gas portfolios in the very near future.”

Nijmegen ","We seek Commitments, not just more Principles",,,,,,"
Forty-five civil society organisations from fourteen countries call on the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) to reformulate the proposed ‘Principles for Responsible Banking’ (PRBs) so that banks aspiring to adopt the principles must make concrete, ambitious and timebound commitments upfront on how they will contribute to solving the world’s many pressing social and environmental problems.
The joint civil society submission  was coordinated by BankTrack and endorsed by 350.org, Amazon Watch, Greenpeace International, Indigenous Environmental Network, Inclusive Development International, Fair Finance Guide International, Global Witness, Future in our Hands, International Rivers and Rainforest Action Network, amongst others.
The submission was presented today to UNEP FI which, together with 28 founding banks, took the initiative for the PRBs.  The PRBs were first announced in Paris in November 2018  and are to be formally launched on September 22nd at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Over 100 banks are expected to have adopted the Principles by the launch in September. 
According to UNEP FI, the PRBs represent the “most significant mechanism ever jointly created by the UN and the global finance industry”, and will be “a framework for a sustainable banking system in which a bank’s business strategy is aligned with society’s goals and guide banks in demonstrating how they are making a positive contribution to society”. They address Alignment; Impact; Clients & Customers; Governance & Target Setting; and Transparency & Accountability.
BankTrack and the co-signing organizations insist that they would like to welcome the PRBs, but they consider the requirements contained in the draft PRBs wholly inadequate for them to be an effective and credible response from the banking sector to today’s massive challenges on poverty, wildlife loss, climate breakdown and human rights violations globally.
The submission, which addresses both the general PRBs framework and each of the six Principles, recommends that UNEP FI reformulate the PRBs to require banks to indeed set public targets in line with the Paris Climate Agreement, Sustainable Development Goals, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and other relevant frameworks, but to invert the adoption process so that such commitments precede rather than follow entry to the initiative. Banks would first need to set public, concrete, and timebound targets that commit them to the PRBs, and only on the basis of a public assessment by UNEP FI would they be admitted to join the initiative as a ‘PRB bank’.
In the current framework, entry into the PRBs only requires that bank CEOs issue a public statement endorsing and signing their bank onto the initiative. Depending on their self-categorization as a starter, intermediate or advanced bank, they may then take up to four years to deliver on their self-defined goals, all the while reaping publicity benefits from being a ‘PRB bank’.
The proposed assessment process would also require that UNEP FI establish firm baselines that all banks will be required to meet for eligibility for admission, rather than inviting any bank to sign on regardless of its level of ambition. This should include baselines around such issues as ending the financing of fossil fuel projects completely, rejecting all financing for projects threatening pristine and intact forests, respecting livelihoods and community interests when considering finance for business activities and respecting the rights of Indigenous people to give or withhold free, prior, and informed consent regarding projects that affect them, to name a few.
Finally, the submission expresses the expectation of civil society that adoption of the PRBs will lead to fundamental changes in business practices throughout the adopting bank, notably on community and stakeholder engagement, transparency and reporting, and across the board accountability.
Johan Frijns, Director of BankTrack, stated: “This is 2019; we are facing widespread poverty, complete climate breakdown, mass extinction of animal and plant species and ongoing human rights violations all over the world, with many banks having a lot to explain on their role in exacerbating these crises. In such an outright emergency situation we expect a bank initiative that meets these challenges head on, not something that allows banks to spend years pondering their next steps without making concrete commitment upfront, all the while publicly posing as UNEP-certified responsible bank. Without fundamental changes in the adoption process the very credibility of the PRBs is at risk right from the start”.
Alison Kirsch, of Rainforest Action Network, stated: “We welcome banks' public commitments to 'align their businesses with the Paris Climate Agreement goals', but these must include an immediate end to financing for fossil fuel expansion and a plan to rapidly phase out fossil fuel financing overall. We can accept no less from banks signing on to the PRBs — especially given the billions of dollars still flowing from many endorsing banks to the fossil fuel industry”.
Anja B. Riise, Director of Framtiden i våre hender, stated: “While this is a welcome initiative by  UNEP FI, the framework needs to be substantially strengthened in order to be fit-for-purpose. What banks lack most is translating all these nice principles into policies that will impact their daily business at the necessary pace. The scale of climate and wildlife crises, unacceptable levels of economic inequality and unmet basic needs of the majority of world population leave no room for yet another set of nice words without substantially changing investment practices. We need banks to stop harmful investments and increase sustainable ones, and urge UNEP FI to fundamentally revise the PRB framework so as to help them do so”.
With this submission BankTrack and endorsing organisations urge UNEP FI and founding banks to adapt the proposed PRB framework, so that it will indeed deliver on the ambition level expressed by UNEP FI, and extend a hand to work together in order to strengthen the PRBs before they are launched in September.

Nijmegen ",International Call on Banks: Don’t finance the East Africa Crude Oil Pipeline,Standard Bank ,South Africa,East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,Uganda,"
A coalition of African and international organisations is today calling on South Africa’s Standard Bank and Japan’s Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp (SMBC) to withdraw from their role as lead arrangers for a massive oil pipeline under construction in Uganda and Tanzania. Download the letter here.


The East Africa Crude Oil Pipeline is being developed as part of a push to open oil fields around Uganda’s Lake Albert to international markets, linking them with the port of Tanga in Tanzania. The pipeline is projected to require an investment of US$3.5 billion, and at 1,443 kilometres it will be the longest heated pipeline in the world. Standard Bank and SMBC are playing key roles advising the governments of Uganda and Tanzania and one of the lead project sponsors, the French oil company Total, and are in the process of arranging US$2.5 billion in project finance loans for the completion of the project.


Local civil society organisations have previously called for fair compensation of communities along the pipeline’s route, but this is the first time that local groups have come together to voice outright opposition to the project.  Twenty environmental and social justice groups from Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya and South Africa joined ten international groups in writing to the banks, drawing attention to grave risks from the pipeline’s construction.


The risks highlighted in the letter include displacement of entire communities in the oil extraction zone and pipeline corridor, impacting up to 14,500 farms in the Tanzanian stretch of the pipeline corridor alone; risks to fresh water sources including Lake Victoria, which supports the livelihoods of more than 30 million people in the region; and severe degradation of habitats of African elephants, eastern chimpanzees and lions. The project is also being developed in a political climate in which human rights defenders and journalists expressing criticism of the project and associated facilities face harassment and threats of retaliation. 


The letter also emphasises the significant climate impact of the pipeline, noting that the 216,000 barrels of crude oil expected to be carried by the pipeline daily can be expected to result in CO2 emissions of over 33 million tonnes each year, significantly greater than the combined emissions of Uganda and Tanzania.  Reserves in currently operating oil and gas fields alone are already enough to send the world beyond 1.5°C of warming, the target agreed at the 2015 UN Climate Summit in Paris, meaning there is no room for the development of new fossil fuel pipelines like EACOP if this is to be met.


The role of Standard Bank as lead arranger is remarkable given that it is acting as the current chair of the Equator Principles Association, the governing body of the banking sector’s premium initiative on environmental and social risk management for project finance. SMBC is also an Equator Principles signatory bank. As chair, Standard Bank is currently overseeing a thorough revision of the Equator Principles, aimed at aligning the Principles with the Paris Climate Agreement goals, amongst others, this following protests of campaigners drawing attention to a series of ‘disaster projects’ financed under the Equator Principles. 

Landry Ninteretse of 350.org Africa stated: “At 350.org Africa, we fully support the ongoing local organising and mobilising efforts to stop the EACOP. At a time when our planet has reached the unprecedented level of 415 of CO2 in the atmosphere, which means more frequent and more intense weather events for the world and Africa where the adaptation and response capacity is very limited, pursuing investment in such a project is economically unviable, ecologically disastrous, and morally unjustifiable. The rapid transition away from fossil fuels is already underway globally and should not exclude African nations.”

Natalie Bugalski of Inclusive Development International said: “There is no greater danger facing humanity than climate change. Given the urgency of this crisis, Standard Bank and SMBC should be doing all they can to help realize the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. Equator Banks like these should be leading the transition to a low-carbon economy, not financing fossil fuel projects that imperil the planet.”

Johan Frijns, director of BankTrack said: “By acting as lead arranger for the EACOP while simultaneously leading the revision process of the Equator Principles, Standard Bank is sending the signal that also under the new EPs projects such as EACOP will continue to be perfectly eligible for financing. This does not bode well for the future relevance of what is supposed to be a prime sustainability standard for the banking industry. It is high time that the Equator Principles categorically exclude financing for all projects that pose high risks to the world’s climate.”

Tokyo ",Mizuho’s new policy on coal-fired power generation financing falls behind Mitsubishi UFJ policy revisions,Mizuho Financial Group ,Japan,,,,"
Joint NGO statement by 350.org Japan, Japan Center for a Sustainable Environment and Society (JACSES), Rainforest Action Network (RAN), KIKO Network, Friends of the Earth Japan, Greenpeace Japan
On May 22, Mizuho Financial Group (hereinafter, Mizuho) announced revisions to its policies for investing in coal-fired power generation in a press release (*1) titled “Strengthening of the promotion system for our approach to sustainability.”
The press release indicates that “Investment and financing for construction of new coal-fired power projects will be provided consistent with international guidelines (such as OECD Official Export Credit Guidelines), energy policies and climate change measures in host countries, and Japan’s energy policy. In principle, financing will be limited to the world’s most advanced ultra-supercritical pressure and higher efficiency projects. (That said, this change will not impact projects for which declarations of support have been made before the enactment of this policy.)”
Among Japan’s three megabanks, Mizuho’s policy falls behind even the standard set by Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group’s (hereinafter MUFG) May 15 policy announcement, in which MUFG declared that it would not provide financing for new coal-fired power projects in principle. (*2) In fact, the policy announcement only aligns Mizuho’s policy with the policy Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation announced in June 2018 (*3), demonstrating just how far behind Mizuho is compared to its peer companies in Japan.
In the three years following the conclusion of the Paris Agreement, 2016-2018, Mizuho ranked among the ten largest fossil-fuel sector funders in terms of loans and underwriting according to the Fossil Fuel Financeing Report Card 2019 (*4), published by Rainforest Action Network (RAN) and other NGOs earlier this year. In the area of coal-fired power generation, Mizuho’s loans and underwriting make it the eighth largest funder for that sector. It is clear that new construction of coal-fired power plants is not in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement, and Mizuho’s policy puts the company far behind major non-Japanese financial institutions in efforts to adjust financial policies appropriately.
We urge Mizuho to put in place a policy to discontinue financing for new coal-fired power operations and withdraw from all investment in companies that are highly dependent on coal-fired power generation and coal mining, including loans, underwriting, and holding of stocks and bonds.
Japan’s three megabanks’ policies are not consistent with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, in part because of their continued support for coal-fired power projects to which they committed before the enactment of those policies. Simply disclosing these projects is not enough. We call on all three banks to further strengthen their policies, including through a prompt review of their support for all coal-fired power generation projects currently being planned or under construction, both domestically and in such recipient countries as Vietnam and Indonesia.

Frankfurt am Main ",Dirty Profits 7 - Out of Control: Irresponsible weapons transfers and future weapon systems,Banco Santander ,Spain,BAE Systems ,arms industry and trade,United Kingdom,"
The DIRTY Profits 7 report presented today in Frankfurt am Main by the NGO Facing Finance highlights the ten European banks with some of the highest investments in 11 global arms companies, companies that have since 2015 been exporting to unstable/crisis-affected countries in the MENA region (Middle East and North Africa) and countries involved in the war in Yemen.
The results: Ten European banks have provided roughly €24.2 billion in finance, and hold some €10 billion in investments in 11 arms companies exporting to Saudi Arabia, the UAE and other countries leading a military campaign in Yemen, and to other controversial, crisis-affected, and politically unstable countries in the MENA region. The results show that Lloyds and UniCredit were the largest financiers (approximately €4 billion each) of the arms companies and Crédit Agricole and Deutsche Bank the largest investors. All of the banks in this report lack a suitably strong definition of what they consider a controversial country for arms export.
Based on the findings of the report, the NGOs Facing Finance, Mwatana (Yemen), and urgewald will assemble at the Deutsche Bank AGM on the 23.05.2019 in Frankfurt to protest the financing of controversial weapon exports. Deutsche Bank has investments in all of the 11 arms companies (to the value of €2.6 billion) and over the period Nov 2015 – Jan 2019 directly provided finance to 7 of the 11 arms companies (€1.8 billion).
Raytheon is a large weapons exporter to Saudi-Arabia, the company has exported thousands of missiles, the use of which have been implicated in the death of civilians in Yemen. Deutsche Bank provided €57 million in loans to Raytheon and, as at January 2019, had €418 million in investments. Additionally, Deutsche Bank provided about €730 million in finance to Leonardo, BAE Systems and Airbus which are all part of the joint venture MBDA, a company that has exported over a thousand Brimstone and Storm Shadow missiles to Saudi Arabia. Deutsche Bank provided loans to BAE Systems as recently as 2018.
“Weapons from the US and Europe have contributed to some of the war’s worst horrors, killing civilians, hitting homes, and helping destroy my country,” said Ali Jameel of the Yemeni NGO Mwatana, who lives in Sana’a. “The Saudi and UAE-led coalition have carried out countless unlawful attacks, many likely war crimes, and those exporting arms risk complicity,” said Jameel.
“Large European Banks, with their financial backing for arms exporters who have been providing weapons for the Yemen war for years, share responsibility for the largest humanitarian disaster on the planet today,” complains Thomas Küchenmeister, Managing Director of Facing Finance and publisher of the DIRTY Profits report. “Banks should no longer finance arms exporters and should adjust their policies to comply with the guidelines of the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) which prohibits the export of weapons which would knowingly be used in war crimes, attacks on civilian objects and civilians, or crimes against humanity, “said Küchenmeister and argues for comprehensive ESG regulation by the Bafin or the legislature.
“Deutsche Bank must comprehensively sharpen its arms policies immediately, especially since the Federal Government has imposed initial export restrictions on Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Their customers and shareholders do not want to benefit from the deadly business models of defense exporters,” summarises Barbara Happe of the human rights organization urgewald.
Dirty Profits 7 also highlights the extent to which the 11 companies are involved in the manufacture and production of nuclear weapons, cluster munitions and landmines – the report takes the opportunity to document the rapid technological rise of Autonomous Weapon Systems. Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems (killer robots) are emerging as key technologies of future warfare and are part of a current global high-tech arms race. The report calls on banks to closely monitor this process and to develop policies which would prevent them financing weapons that operate without human intervention.
The companies researched in the report are Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Raytheon, BAE Systems, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, Airbus, Leonardo, Thales and the German companies Rheinmetall and ThyssenKrupp.
The ten European banks (those with the largest finance provision for the selected companies) include Deutsche Bank und Commerzbank, as well as Lloyds, Barclays, Crédit Agricole, BNP Paribas, BBVA, Banco Santander, Credit Suisse and Unicredit.

Berlin ",Fool’s Gold – €16bn for Europe’s biggest climate polluters,Banco Santander ,Spain,CEZ Group ,energy plants - coal | energy plants - nuclear | mining - coal ,Czech Republic,"
Eight financial institutions have handed Europe’s most polluting utilities almost €16 billion in support since the Paris Agreement was signed in December 2015, a new briefing by Europe Beyond Coal and its partners BankTrack, Foundation Development YES – Open-Pit Mines NO, Friends of the Earth France, IIDMA, Re:Common and urgewald has found.

 
Fool’s Gold – the Financial Institutions Bankrolling Europe’s Most Coal-dependent Utilities ranks European financial institutions for their exposure to coal, and shows that the Norwegian Government Pension Fund is the most exposed to coal assets with €2.29 billion in shares and bonds, followed by Crédit Agricole with €1.04 billion, Deutsche Bank with €0.69 billion and Standard Life Aberdeen with €0.58 billion. On the creditor side, UniCredit was the largest bank providing €3.13 billion in loans and underwriting services. Santander follows with € 2.99 billion, Barclays with €2.71 billion and BNP Paribas with €2.57 billion. Combined these “exposed eight” have handed the coal industry as much financial support in the last three years as the European Union has allocated to its space programme for 2021-2027.

 
Kaarina Kolle, Finance and Utility Coordinator at Europe Beyond Coal, said: “After the Paris Agreement you would have to be living on another planet to think that investing any money in coal is a good idea. Some financial institutions apparently think they do operate in a different world, and are willing to risk their reputations and financial returns on it. In reality here on Earth: any financial ties to polluting utilities that aren’t being used to push for a coal phase out are a problem for everyone. Financial institutions have a responsibility to help secure a 2030 coal phase out in Europe from utilities, and if they cannot then to cut all financial ties with them.""

 

Coal utilities enjoying continued support from these financial institutions include RWE, PGE, EPH, Fortum/Uniper, ČEZ and Enel/Endesa. Together they are responsible for more than half of all EU coal-based CO2 emissions and health impacts from polluted air. Shutting down their coal plants by 2030 at the absolute latest is necessary to fulfill Europe’s climate commitments.

 
Katrin Ganswindt, urgewald Climate Campaigner, said: “The amount of capital that is still being directed to maintain coal in the European power mix is staggering. But not a single investor or creditor in their right mind should think that coal has a future. The reality is: what was once considered to be a golden investment is now a foolhardy one. Those sticking to coal will be left with nothing but stranded assets.”

Report methodology  The research on supporters of Europe’s most polluting utilities has been commissioned by Europe Beyond Coal and was conducted by Profundo. Data was extracted from the Bloomberg Terminal and Thomson EIKON, both accessed February 2019.  The research resulted in a ranking of banks for their financing activities, loans and underwriting, and a ranking of institutional investors with their exposure to shares and bonds.  Exempted from the research are non-financial-corporate, individual, government or municipal owners. The timeframe is 2016-2018, though for shares and bonds only the  recent filings were included.

",Green bonds used to finance damaging industrial tree plantations,,,,,,"
Green Bonds are used to finance business-as-usual tree plantations and operations of the paper & pulp industry and claiming exaggerated CO2 savings, a new briefing by the Environmental Paper Network (EPN) shows. The briefing presents a case study of a Green Bond issued by the Brazilian pulp & paper giant Fibria, even though the company has not engaged in any kind of environmental reorientation of its business activities. Instead, its Green Bond was used to finance expansions of monoculture industrial tree plantations.
The briefing argues that bonds for industrial tree plantations should not be eligible for a “green” label, as these do not provide additional ecological nor financial benefits. In addition to the negative ecological impacts such as reduction of water availability and pollution by pesticides and fertilizers, plantations have also caused numerous social and land conflicts with traditional communities in Brazil. In order to be beneficial for the climate, tree plantations should maintain and increase the amount of carbon stored in them over time, rather than have the trees quickly harvested and used for short lived products.
Fibria launched a Bond of USD 700 million in 2017 which according to research by EPN has been mostly used to plant eucalyptus plantations and to purchase certified wood for its pulp mills. To a large extent these purchases are part of the everyday business of Fibria.
Green Bonds are supposed to be bonds earmarked for the financing of climate and environmental projects. Issuers of bonds like Fibria usually label bonds ‘green’ themselves, sometimes backed by different kinds of voluntary standards. However, the generally weak criteria of these standards and the poor disclosure requirements allow many business-as-usual projects to be labelled as “green”.
“The example of bonds by Fibria to finance business-as-usual industrial plantations raises the question of whether these self-labelled bonds and weak standards can credibly guarantee that money invested in these bonds will have a positive impact on the environmental and the climate”, said Merel van der Mark, coordinator of pulp finance work at the Environmental Paper Network.
“Green Bonds are an excellent opportunity to put together the growing demand for ethical investment for the huge environmental challenges the world is facing. They can attract resources otherwise unavailable and finance the implementation of projects that contribute to a better environment and climate. But this can only work if the green bonds can provide additional benefits, both financially and ecologically”, said Wolfgang Kuhlmann, the author of the briefing.

",Banks and investors must have shipping on their radar to be true climate leaders - Share Action,,,,,,"
Banks and investors have been challenged to up their game in the battle to decarbonise the shipping industry, as International Maritime Organisation (IMO) meetings continue this week in London.
In a new report, responsible investment organisation ShareAction calls on banks to align their shipping portfolios with the Paris Agreement and end financing for companies dependent on coal transportation. With shipping emissions set to rise 50-250% by 2050 if left unchecked, ShareAction argues that investor engagement with banks on this issue needs to be a priority.
A number of climate-related risks are identified in the report. As regulation aims at lowering greenhouse gas emissions, the industry is likely to face rising costs, with the IMO 2020 sulphur cap already weighing on companies. Another key risk identified is the industry’s dependence on fossil fuels as a driver of seaborne trade. By 2035, as a result of the energy transition, the transportation of oil and coal by sea could fall 33% and 50% respectively, according to research cited in the report.
ShareAction recommends that banks incorporate climate-related risks into financial analysis to manage these extra headwinds. The industry is already struggling with a surplus of ships and rising debt levels. Energy efficient ships do not just reduce carbon emissions but also have a higher resale value, allowing companies to better repay bank debts in the event of default.
In December 2018, the IMO announced its strategy to reduce GHG emissions, targeting a 50% absolute reduction by 2050. Maersk, the world’s largest container shipping company, then raised the bar, announcing its own target of net-zero emissions by 2050 and aligning with the Paris Agreement. ShareAction is now calling on banks and investors to push others in the industry to match Maersk’s level of ambition or, at a minimum, match the IMO’s target.
ShareAction makes four key recommendations to banks:

Set and disclose targets for the climate alignment of shipping loan portfolios, aiming for alignment with the Paris Agreement.
Incorporate climate-related risks into credit risk assessment when lending to shipping companies.
Require that clients have a strategy and targets to reduce GHG emissions which, at a minimum, meet the IMO 2050 50% reduction target. Banks should engage with clients on alignment with the Paris Agreement, requiring net-zero emissions by 2050.
Require that clients are not highly dependent on revenues from coal transportation, aligned with or going beyond any existing bank coal policies.

Christian Wilson, senior research officer at ShareAction and author of the report, says: “The shipping industry frequently slips under the radar in the climate change debate and warrants closer scrutiny. To help change the course of the industry from runaway emissions to decarbonisation, banks need to step up and push clients to cut carbon emissions. Institutional investors, who have been instrumental in engaging with banks on fossil fuel financing, now need to use their influence to press banks on this issue, ensuring that their investments have a positive impact on our world.”

",Warning issued to investors: Forest biomass is risky business,,,,,,"
The Environmental Paper Network, Global Forest Coalition and Biofuelwatch have today issued a Briefing to investors that highlights the serious reputational, regulatory, legal, and financial risks associated with bioenergy projects that rely on wood from forests and tree plantations.
The briefing highlights that installations that burn forest biomass are almost always dependent on public subsidies and thus highly vulnerable to policy change. In several cases, larger projects have failed to return a profit even with generous subsidies in place.
The publication further summarises the adverse climate and environmental impacts associated with bioenergy from forest wood, pointing to the scientific evidence that shows that it is a high-carbon source of energy, and to a civil society statement signed by 136 organisations, which calls for an end to subsidies for forest biomass. It points out that failure to fully disclose all of the environmental, social and governance risks associated with bioenergy would leave investors open to regulatory and legal challenges.
The briefing for investors also highlights additional financial risks specific to biomass energy, illustrated by the experiences of several companies which have invested in such projects. These include a significant risk of fires and explosions linked to woodchip and especially pellet storage and handling, and technical failure of numerous ‘state of the art’ or ‘advanced’ biomass technology projects.
Almuth Ernsting, Biofuelwatch, states: “Investment in biomass energy is neither green nor a safe investment. By comparison, investing in wind and solar power not only helps to reduce carbon emissions and therefore the impacts of climate change, but it also offers immediate economic benefits when compared to bioenergy.”
Oliver Munnion, Global Forest Coalition, adds: “Many investors who are rightly looking to move funds away from fossil fuels have been misled into thinking that burning wood for energy is low-carbon. They need to wake up to the fact that such investments are causing more destructive logging and worsening climate change. As awareness of the true impacts of biomass energy projects grows, so too do the risks of investments in them”
Merel van der Mark, Environmental Paper Network, says: “Investing in a sector that is so highly dependent on subsidies, knowing that these subsidies are likely to end soon due to regulatory changes, is a very risky business.”

Nijmegen ",BankTrack publishes its 2018 Annual Report,,,,,,"
Today BankTrack is pleased to present its 2018 Annual Report, detailing our work to stop banks from financing harmful business activities, promote a banking sector that respects human rights and contributes to just societies and a healthy planet, and to support others in civil society who share these aims.
For BankTrack, 2018 was first and foremost the year to drastically up our game on climate change. Together with allies around the world we launched our new flagship ‘Fossil Banks, No Thanks!’ campaign. Recognising we can no longer be satisfied with incremental and in-adequate policy steps like quitting coal, we demand urgent and drastic action from banks to immediately end financing for new fossil fuel projects, and rapidly phase out their financing of existing clients.
We have no illusions here. Our latest research has shown that, since the signing of the Paris Agreement, banks have poured at least US$ 1.9 trillion into the fossil fuel sector, and it will take long and sustained pressure from many sides to force banks out. What gives us confidence that we will eventually succeed is that we are now part of a strong and exponentially growing global movement involving a wide range of actors, including this year a growing and inspiring movement of schoolchildren striking for our future.
Stopping banks from financing climate change is a central plank of our efforts to hold banks accountable for the impact of their finance, but not the only one. We also kept a close eye on the Equator Principles review process, instigated a year earlier by our 'Equator Banks, Act!' campaign and still ongoing. Our messages to bankers here have also emphasized that the time for small incremental change is over, and that an end to new fossil fuel finance needs to be part of the outcome.
That same message we also conveyed to the group of banks that launched the draft Principles for Responsible Banking in November. Banks cannot be content with the modest goals and lenient timelines incorporated in these Principles. Urgency and high ambition are required!
Linked to all these developments, we also reported on the dire state of accountability in the banking sector, urging banks to get on with developing their own accountability mechanisms (including as part of the Equator Principles review), and set out what these grievance mechanisms should look like in practice.
And last but not least, in October, we celebrated our 15th anniversary with a grandiose dance party in Nijmegen’s old soup factory turned creative hotspot. We celebrated together with guests and allies from all over the world, who had come to our home town to attend our bi-annual Bank Campaigners Gathering, a three-day event where we exchange experiences, plot campaign strategies for the future and above all renew our commitment to one another to together continue to push banks forward, now and for the next fifteen years at least. The task is daunting, but our spirit is high.
With gratitude for your support for our efforts,
Johan Frijns, Director, BankTrack

Zürich ",Mozambique’s hidden debt: Public Eye files a criminal complaint against Credit Suisse,Credit Suisse ,Switzerland,,,,"
The public debt of Mozambique, one of the poorest countries in the world, has skyrocketed due to loans totalling over two billion dollars that have been subject to large-scale embezzlement. Half of this sum was granted by Credit Suisse’s UK subsidiary. There are sufficient indications to justify the opening of criminal proceedings in Switzerland to determine the responsibility of the Zurich-based parent company in the granting of the loans and in relation to payments suspected of being corrupt. For this reason, Public Eye has filed a criminal complaint with the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) in Bern, Switzerland.
 

In early 2016, the press revealed that Mozambique had significantly increased its public debt by accepting loans, some of which it kept secret. Over the course of 2013 and 2014, Credit Suisse International, the UK subsidiary of Credit Suisse Group AG, granted loans totalling over a billion dollars to two Mozambican state-owned enterprises via the maritime company Privinvest, based in the United Arab Emirates. The funds were supposed to be used to purchase speedboats for the coast guard and allegedly to construct a float for tuna fishing in the high seas. The estimated cost of the purchases was hugely inflated, and certain vessels were not operational. In addition to Credit Suisse, the Russian investment bank VTB Capital also lent approx. one billion dollars to the same two state-owned firms as well as a third entity. Immediately after the new debt was announced, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and numerous donor countries – including Switzerland – suspended their direct budgetary support to Mozambique. The rampant inflation that resulted and the budget cuts adopted by the government took a heavy toll on one of the poorest populations in the world.
On 19 December 2018, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) indicted eight people in connection with the case, notably for their involvement in the corruption and money laundering scheme. Alongside Mozambique’s former minister of finance, who has been arrested for these acts, three former senior managers of Credit Suisse International who made the preparations for the loans to be granted are being investigated in the same case. The DoJ alleges that they jointly organised corrupt payments to Mozambican officials totalling up to 200 million dollars, and of personally benefitting from kickbacks. The three bankers are accused of circumventing numerous internal controls within the bank by making false statements to the compliance department, which was tasked with ensuring that reasonable due diligence has been conducted prior to the granting of loans. The bank did in fact impose special requirements for the loans to be approved: authorisation of the loan agreement by the central bank of Mozambique, approval from the Administrative Court and notification thereof to the IMF. In reality none of these conditions were fulfilled. According to the US indictment, the compliance department did indeed ask critical questions but failed to check the answers provided and ‘to pursue its inquiry further’.
To date, the Swiss Attorney General has simply confirmed that no criminal proceedings have been opened in Switzerland. In response to an article in the Swiss press, Credit Suisse Group AG argued that the loan transaction had been conducted by the UK subsidiary Credit Suisse International in line with ‘clearly regulated’ company guidelines. Nevertheless, the publicly available documents pertaining to the case provide sufficient information to clarify the responsibility of the Swiss parent company. With its criminal complaint, Public Eye is calling on the Office of the Attorney General to investigate whether Credit Suisse Group AG fulfilled its corporate responsibility to oversee its subsidiary and prevent unlawful conduct as required of companies by the Swiss criminal code.

","DBS gambles on coal, as scrutiny arrives at its AGM",DBS ,Singapore,Vung Ang II coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Vietnam,"
At the annual general meeting of DBS today, the Singaporean bank was challenged over its plans to excuse several proposed projects from its policy to stop funding new coal power.
Last Thursday DBS released what, in all fairness, was a pretty good policy on coal power plants. They simply said the bank would not lend to any new coal power plants, regardless of technology type. It made DBS the third major lender in ASEAN in the last seven months to rule out new coal, following Standard Chartered and OCBC.
But like the other two banks, DBS’ policy had a catch. It allowed the bank to continue with projects it was already involved with at the time the policy was announced. These included the Vung Ang 2 and Van Phong 1 power stations in Vietnam (the latter of which was financed the very next day), and Java 9 and 10 in Indonesia.
Adhityani Putri, a representative from Indonesia, attended the AGM to specifically ask about the bank’s involvement in the Java 9 and 10 project, a 2,000 MW power station.
Java 9 and 10 would be built about 100km from Jakarta and, in Adhityani’s words, contribute to making the city unlivable from air pollution that would vastly exceed the World Health Organisation’s standards.
She asked DBS whether they were aware of the full extent of the health impacts that would be caused by Java 9 and 10 and, as financial adviser, whether DBS would communicate these risks to other banks that might join a syndicate, an undertaking DBS CEO Piyush Gupta didn’t make.
Meeting the goals of Paris while building new coal power plants?
Market Forces’ Executive Director Julien Vincent then challenged DBS over its decision to finance new coal power stations, while claiming its policy was consistent with meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement.
He asked whether DBS agreed with the chief executive of the International Energy Agency (IEA), Fatih Birol, who said last year that “We have no room to build anything that emits CO2 emissions” if we want to stay below 2°C.
Mr Gupta responded citing the IEA’s Sustainable Development Scenario, which is claimed to be consistent with meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. But in its announcement DBS made clear it relied on two competing scenarios to determine its policy; the IEA’s and the IPCC’s. The IPCC scenarios to keep global warming to 1.5ºC with no or little overshoot see a fall in coal power of nearly 80% by 2030, hardly the kind of scenario that allows for new coal power plants.
But the IEA’s Sustainable Development Scenario, which only goes out 20 years and targets a mere 50% chance of constraining warming to 2°C (rather than 1.5°C), relies heavily on unproven technologies and concepts in charting a course for reaching net zero emissions in the second half of the century.
It’s worth noting that the IEA doesn’t currently produce scenarios consistent with 1.5°C and has recently been requested to do so by over 40 business leaders, investors, and energy experts (not including DBS).
Ultimately, while there is a solid scientific basis for not financing new coal power plants based on the IPCC’s 1.5ºC scenario, and a highly risky and assumption-laden basis for using the IEA to justify new coal power of any kind, the decision to exclude several new coal power plants from the policy has nothing to do with science, and everything to do with the number of projects that DBS happened to be involved in at the time the policy was announced. If they were involved in one, three, five or ten new deals, that’s the number of projects DBS would attempt to grandfather through, regardless of the impact on greenhouse gas emissions.
Julien went on to ask how the bank managed the stranded asset risk that would be embedded in coal power plants that wouldn’t be able to see out their expected operating lives under a Paris-aligned scenario. Mr Gupta said that the banks were covered because of the backing of Export Credit Agencies, and power purchase agreements guaranteed by the coal power plant’s host government.
Mr Gupta agreed when Julien asked if that just transferred all of the risk onto the state.

Download the report here 
As the world's largest rainforest, the Amazon provides 20% of our oxygen, houses 10% of the planet's biodiversity, and helps stabilize the global climate. The world needs it to survive. None understand this better than the indigenous peoples and traditional communities who call it home, and are proven to be its best stewards.
Despite their importance, the Brazilian Amazon and its peoples are suffering the worst assault in a generation. Deforestation is mounting dramatically while hard-fought environmental and human rights protections, critical to the future of the rainforest, are under serious attack. Indigenous peoples and traditional communities themselves suffer disproportionate violence and repression for defending their rights and forests.
The ascension of the extreme right-wing politician Jair Bolsonaro to Brazil's presidency profoundly exacerbates the country's environmental and human rights crisis. Since taking power, his government has slashed socio- environmental standards that are fundamental to preserving the Amazon's ecological integrity and the well-being of forest peoples. Bolsonaro's severe policy rollbacks are occurring in the context of a generalized attack on the country's democratic principles and institutions.
A dominant, conservative faction of the country's powerful agroindustrial sector known as the “ruralistas” is helping drive Bolsonaro's Amazon agenda. Working from within Bolsonaro's government, industry representatives are stripping protections for forests and land rights in order to gain unfettered access to areas currently safeguarded from industrial activity. Their success would spell disaster for Brazil's Amazonian forests and the indigenous and traditional peoples who call them home, while jeopardizing the global climate.
The political and economic power that sustains these retrograde actors is provided in large part by global market actors: commodity traders, financiers and consumers. European and North American businesses that finance and source from Brazilian businesses connected with today's rollbacks therefore enable Brazil's socio-environmental landscape to be reshaped to our collective detriment.
The crises facing the Amazon require innovative solutions that address the root of the problem. By identifying the worst actors operating in the Brazilian Amazon and the global companies and financial institutions that enable them, we can build new forms of leverage over these actors and press for reform and accountability on the part of the Bolsonaro regime.
To challenge adversaries in the federal government and private sector, Brazil's National Indigenous Mobilization (MNI) has called for a global boycott of Brazilian commodities associated with human rights abuses and environmental destruction. The MNI requests solidarity from international community to support these efforts, which aim to leverage global markets in order to moderate the behavior of the agroindustrial sector, as a means to halt Bolsonaro's assault, ultimately protecting and restoring environmental safeguards and human rights.
Global solidarity with Brazil's movement for social and environmental justice is more critical now than ever. While we acknowledge the North's oversize role in environmental mismanagement, human rights abuses, and climate change, we believe that through informed choices, the European and North American private sector and engaged citizens in the region can considerably influence the destructive agenda of the Bolsonaro government.

Amsterdam, the Netherlands ",Dutch bank ING challenged over finance for fossil gas expansion,ING ,Netherlands,Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) ,oil and gas,- international -,"
Today interventions inside and outside the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of ING, a Dutch multinational banking corporation, raised the pressure on shareholders to end the bank’s practice of financing fossil fuel and demanded that it pulls out of projects like the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP). TAP is the €5 billion western extension of the Southern Gas Corridor (SGC), a carbon bomb that will transport an initial 10 billion cubic metres of fossil gas per year from the Caspian Sea to Europe.
ING shareholder Serena Fiorentino, also a member of the ‘NoTAP mums’, one of the many diverse local groups forming the bedrock of the regional NoTAP movement, spoke out during the AGM. She challenged the assumption made by the bank and other TAP shareholders (a group largely comprised of oil and gas companies) that burning gas is a safer, cleaner alternative to other fossil fuels and emphasised the social and economic impacts that pipeline construction has on local communities.
“I know firsthand the physical and psychological destruction this pipeline is inflicting on the communities in its path. I imagined that my children would inherit the beauty of the same place where I grew up. Instead they are inheriting a legacy of reinforced concrete, barbed wire, expropriated land, denied rights, destroyed local economies, and a southern Italy once again exploited and succumbed to the interests of the strongest and most powerful,” says Fiorentino.
Fiorentino asked what plans the bank has in place to assess the reputational risk of investing in dangerous fossil fuel infrastructure rather than renewable energy. Just last week the OECD demanded that ING formulates concrete climate goals for its financial services, in line with the Paris Climate Agreement, and in 2018 the bank was embroiled in a money laundering scandal. She finished by calling on the bank to commit to a review of its lending policies in light of the negative impacts TAP is having now and will continue to do so decades into the future.
Outside the AGM conference campaigners staged an action showing that the public don’t want their banks funding fossil fuels and climate chaos, further challenging shareholders to tackle their bank’s regressive fossil fuel financing practices. ING is one of 17 banks supporting the TAP with a lucrative €635 million loan facility, the bank’s financing of fossil fuels is increasing year on year despite the need to rapidly cut greenhouse gas emissions.
Claire Hamlett at BankTrack, one of the organisers of the action, explains: “Climate change is already bringing disaster and suffering to many parts of the world. Banks that support the climate-wrecking fossil fuel industry must rapidly change course. ING has made good moves on coal but has few restrictions on its oil and gas financing, leading it to be involved in projects like TAP which will lock Europe into decades more of fossil fuel dependence. ING must get as ambitious on cutting oil and gas from its portfolio as it has been on coal.”
Across Europe the climate movement is growing - interest in the issue is soaring as impacts hit home and the next generation strike from school to save their future from climate chaos. People are gearing up over the AGM season to demand that private financiers like RBS, Credit Suisse, Barclays, Standard Chartered, Société Générale, Crédit Agricole, BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, and Natixis drop their support for fossil fuel expansion. Public institutions like the European Investment Bank (EIB), that have spent billions of taxpayers money on dangerous new infrastructure like TAP, will also face a challenge to their impunity and unethical financing.
The message is clear, communities will no longer stand by and let banks finance dangerous new fossil fuel projects that are driving climate change as well as local social and economic

Nijmegen ",Dutch NCP on OECD Guidelines: Banks must publish climate targets in line with Paris Climate Agreement,ING ,Netherlands,,,,"
The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises demand that Dutch bank ING formulates concrete climate goals for its financial services, in line with the Paris Climate Agreement, concludes the Dutch National Contact Point for OECD Guidelines in its final statement following a complaint lodged against ING in May 2017 by Oxfam Novib, Greenpeace NL, BankTrack and Friends of the Earth Netherlands (Milieudefensie).
Peter Ras, senior policy advisor at Oxfam Novib: “We are happy about this well-considered decision by the National Contact Point, making it clear that banks – in order to adhere to the OECD Guidelines – must formulate concrete climate goals for their financial services that are in line with the Paris Climate Agreement. This means that banks in the Netherlands and abroad will have to work hard on this. It’s also very good to see that for the first time the OECD Contact Point takes a clear position on climate goals.”
The four organisations that lodged this complaint welcome the fact that ING has agreed in 2018 to bring its portfolio in line with the Paris Climate Agreement and that ING is also prepared to publish interim goals for doing so. They urge ING to bring its lending portfolio in line with the goal of limiting average global temperature rise to below 1.5 degrees Celsius as soon as possible. Remaining below 1.5 degrees will make all the difference to inhabitants of island nations and deltas such as Bangladesh, as to them this is literally the difference between continuing their lives in their homes or having to flee due to rising sea levels, according to the four NGOs.
Kees Kodde, campaigner at Greenpeace: “It is crucial that ING publishes its interim goals as soon as possible. The financial sector justifies loans to fossil fuel companies with scenarios of the International Energy Agency (IEA) that are overly reliant on unproven technologies such as Carbon Capture and Storage. A better approach would be to completely phase out all financing of fossil fuels as quickly as possible. In this respect, ING is setting the right example with coal.”
Johan Frijns, director at BankTrack: “We appreciate that ING is prepared to finance the much-needed technology transition for a range of business sectors with a large impact on our climate. However, this approach does not offer a solution for the oil and gas industry, currently the main drivers of climate change, together with coal. ING must completely phase out its investments in oil and gas, which were worth 25.5 billion dollars between 2015 and 2018, just as it did with coal already.”
In May 2017, Oxfam Novib, Greenpeace, BankTrack and Friends of the Earth NL lodged a complaint against ING at the National Contact Point for OECD Guidelines, claiming that ING did not adhere to the OECD Guidelines with regards to its climate policy. In November 2017 the complaint was declared eligible by the National Contact Point of OECD. It was the first time that a climate-related complaint was declared eligible by an OECD Contact Point.
After the complaint was lodged, ING in December 2017 published its decision to almost completely phase out its investments in the coal industry by the year 2025 and refrain from investing in new coal-fired power stations. In September 2018, ING publicly announced that it will begin steering its lending portfolio towards meeting the Paris Agreement’s goal of keeping global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius. In its final statement, the National Contact Point does not establish whether in 2017 ING was in violation of the OECD Guidelines.
NGOs and ING have agreed to jointly call upon the Dutch government to request the IEA to as soon as possible develop two scenarios, with and without relying on Carbon Capture and Storage, that provide a 66% chance of limiting average global temperature rise to below 1.5 degrees Celsius. This follows a similar call on IEA made last month by a group of institutional investors. Having such new scenarios in place that aim for 1,5 degrees rather than 2 degrees maximum temperature rise will allow banks and other financial institutions to adjust their loans and investments accordingly.

Santander, Spain ",Santander’s deep support for fossil fuel industry challenged at bank’s AGM,Banco Santander ,Spain,Polska Grupa Energetyczna (PGE) ,energy plants - coal | energy plants - nuclear | mining - coal ,Poland,"
Today at Banco Santander’s annual shareholders’ meeting environmental campaigners from across Europe challenged the bank’s board of directors to take action to cut the institution’s multi-billion dollar support for the fossil fuel industry.
Outside the AGM, in Santander, Spain, campaigners from Ecologistas en Acción hung large banners from a sailing boat with the combined messages aimed at Spain’s biggest bank of ‘Fossil Banks, No Thanks!’ and ‘By 2020 We Rise Up’.
Inside the AGM, Polish NGO Foundation ""Development YES - Open-Pit Mines NO"" raised the issue of Santander’s ongoing support for the coal expansion activities of one of Europe’s top polluters, Poland’s state-owned PGE. 
In September 2018, Santander participated in a four bank consortium which provided PGE with EUR 950 million in general company financing which campaigners maintain is being ploughed into the state-owned utility’s coal power plant expansion programme. 
Kuba Gogolewski, of Foundation ""Development YES - Open-Pit Mines NO"" and present at today’s AGM, said:
“Santander can show real, positive climate leadership by turning off its financing tap for PGE, one of Europe’s worst polluters. As PGE continues to plan new lignite mines and coal plants, it’s crunch time for the financially vulnerable company. When it comes knocking on Santander’s door in the coming few weeks for another financial lifeline, we expect the bank to put public health and the climate ahead of profits and say no to PGE’s alarming coal expansion plans.”
Santander’s $15 billion financial support for the fossil fuel industry over the last three years was revealed in a recent report.
Samuel Martin-Sosa, of Ecologistas en Acción, said:
“There is an emerging social mobilisation all over the world demanding immediate and effective climate action from governments and corporations. If fossil banks like Santander do not understand this message clearly they will face increasing social discontent. There are many people committing to rise up for climate justice by 2020 if things do not change now.”
Greig Aitken, of BankTrack which is coordinating the global Fossil Banks, No Thanks! campaign with the support of over 200 organisations around the world, said: 
“Throwing $15 billion at the fossil fuel industry in the three years since the Paris agreement was signed is not a very hot look for Santander, but the bank’s finance is clearly contributing to ever hotter temperatures. Today’s action is the fifth Fossil Banks, No Thanks! protest outside a bank AGM in a week, following other protests at the AGMs of TD Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, Unicredit and also HSBC today, with many further AGM actions to follow in the weeks to come.  
“Instead of undermining global efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions to keep the rise in average temperature no higher than 1.5 degrees, Santander and other big banks have to cut out the excuse-making and instead start cutting fossil fuel companies from their portfolios, starting right now.”

Rome, Italy ",UniCredit: Out of Turkish Coal!,UniCredit ,Italy,,,,"
Re:Common on the occasion of today's shareholders' meeting of Unicredit launches its latest report ""An Ash Country - the Italian responsibilities in the devastating coal race in Turkey"".


Unicredit is the foreign bank most involved in the Turkish coal business. In 2014, the most important Italian credit institution through its Turkish subsidiary Yapi Kredi and its partner Koc Financial Services granted two loans of 417 million dollars each to the Turkish companies Limak and IC Ictas. The loans were for the acquisition of the newly privatised Yenikoy and Kemerkoy coal-fired power plants in the Mugla region (north-west Turkey), with a total capacity of 1,050 MW. In the following years Unicredit further supported Limak with loans for 135 million dollars. The two plants have been exempted from environmental legislation and have caused serious impacts on human health, agriculture and the environment. The Milas-Sekkoy lignite mine, which powers the facilities, is expanding and 21 villages are at risk of resettlement.


Since 1983, the plants in the Mugla region (three out of a total of 26 in Turkey) have been responsible for the emission of 9.5 million tonnes of sulphur dioxide, 890 thousand tonnes of nitrogen oxide, 65 thousand tonnes of fine dust, 28 thousand kg of mercury (discharged into the Mediterranean) and 360 million tonnes of CO2. According to a report drawn up by CAN Europe from a health point of view, in three decades about 45 thousand premature deaths have been recorded, the hospitalization of about 46 thousand people due to respiratory problems and cardiovascular diseases, and the loss of about 12 million days of work.


""Unicredit lends billions for coal throughout Europe and is the only major European bank that still has no exclusion policy for direct financing of coal projects,"" said Antonio Tricarico of Re:Common, who spoke at the meeting. ""That's why we are asking the top management of the bank to stop financing any project or coal company in Turkey and to adopt a new coal policy, but also to stop supporting the entire fossil fuel industry, responsible for climate change,"" concluded Tricarico.


""We believe that Unicredit should follow the virtuous example of Assicurazioni Generali, which at the end of last year published its new policy on climate change, which provides for a large divestment from coal,"" said Alessandro Runci of Re:Common, who is also present in Milan.


Re:Common is a member of the European campaign Europe Beyond Coal represented in Milan by finance and utility coordinator Jiri Jerabek who asked UniCredit to adopt a policy that immediately excludes any financing to projects and companies for the expansion of coal and the retrofitting of existing plants, and then to gradually stop any relationship with existing coal customers, such as EPH of the Czech Republic, by 2025, when Italy decided to close all its coal plants (EBC briefing on UniCredit).


Re:Common's requests are supported by more than 200 global civil society organizations, gathered in the Fossil Banks, No Thanks!, campaign. BankTrack’s climate campaigner Claire Hamlett, who is coordinating the campaign, is in Milan to present data from the recent Banking on Climate Change 2019 report and to call on Unicredit to end its fossil fuel finance in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement (Banking on Climate Change 2019).

Nijmegen, the Netherlands ","UBS quietly improves its coal exclusion policy – a bit too weak, a bit too late  ",Credit Suisse ,Switzerland,,,,"
In reaction to UBS updating its coal exclusion policy last week, Katya Nikitenko, Greenpeace Finance Campaign Lead, said:
“If this were 2008, such an announcement would have earned UBS a lot of plaudits. Unfortunately, in 2019, we are ten years away from being swept away by irreversible climate change, and we all need to take brave and big steps to decarbonise the world.
“UBS has provided close to USD 25 billion in funding to fossil fuels over the 3 years since the Paris Agreement was signed. Most of it is going via corporate lending. While UBS has now decided to not do business with coal-fired operators which have more than 30% coal reliance and which don’t have a proper transition strategy in place, they have unfortunately held back from imposing a similar restriction criteria for their clients such as Glencore active in coal mining, although they do restrict finance to clients active in mountain top removal. Vague wording about severely restricting lending and capital raising has been used instead, which is impossible for regulators, investors, or civil society to measure.
“Moreover, the bank has made no pledges to restrict lending or capital raising for clients active in the exploration, production or transportation of tar sands and shale oil, and other extreme fossil fuels. This is very disappointing given that, over the past two years, three separate delegations of indigenous leaders from North America – all women whose tribes are directly affected by the operations of banks’ clients – have met and urged UBS to issue a public policy excluding funding to such clients and activities.”
Greig Aitken, climate campaigner at BankTrack, said:
“UBS’s decision to end support for power companies with more than 30% reliance on coal is welcome and, two years on from the announcement of its last coal power finance restriction, sees the bank pulling its socks up a bit further.
“However, fossil fuel financing at UBS runs deep. Data from the recently released ‘Banking on Climate Change 2019’ report shows that UBS’s total financing to 1,800 fossil fuel companies across all sectors has grown every year since the Paris Agreement was adopted, from USD 7.6 billion in 2016 to USD 10 billion in 2018. This is a huge slap in the face to global efforts aimed at catalysing the clean energy transition and to indigenous communities struggling against rapacious pipeline companies.
“The global Fossil Banks, No Thanks! Campaign is calling for banks to end their support for all new fossil fuel projects and to phase out support for all existing fossil fuel projects and companies. UBS has to step up.”
Katya Nikitenko continued:
“In its annual report, UBS prides itself on ‘protecting its clients’ assets’, and strives to be the provider of choice for clients looking to align their portfolios to benefit from the transition to a low carbon economy. However, less than 3% of all UBS client’s assets are invested in ‘climate-related sustainable investments’, which raises the question – if the bank is serious about protecting its client’s assets, why not make sure that all of its clients’ investments are climate optimised and free of stranded assets?
“UBS also claims to be the most sustainable bank in Switzerland. This is not a difficult feat when the main competition is Credit Suisse. Credit Suisse, which has also recently issued its annual report for 2018, has not updated any of its policies covering banks’ lending to fossil fuels, and is yet to report any concrete details and numbers related to its climate financial risks disclosure, or measures that it says it took to integrate climate risks into its market and credit risk cycle.
“Once again, both of Switzerland’s big two banks are failing to make any brave and concrete steps and show true global leadership on climate action.”

Nijmegen ",World’s biggest banks routinely hide links to human rights and environmental abuses behind client confidentiality – study,,,,,,"
Some of the world’s biggest banks are routinely hiding behind client confidentiality to conceal investments in companies and projects that infringe human and environmental rights, the first study of its kind reveals today.
BankTrack, which campaigns to hold commercial banks accountable, today publishes analysis of five years of correspondence with 31 major international banks regarding problematic projects they finance. It finds that in nearly half of all responses (70 of 150), banks said they could not comment on whether they had a relationship with a particular customer or project. Half of those responses cited client confidentiality as the reason.
The study also finds no legal obstacles to banks disclosing information about their clients in high-risk industries like mining, oil and gas or palm oil, provided they obtain client consent. In almost all major banking centres, client confidentiality is written into bank contracts but is not a statutory requirement. Even where it is, in countries such as Switzerland and Singapore, the report finds disclosure is clearly possible with client consent. 
“When big banks hide links to companies that use child labour, trash rainforests or displace indigenous people, they make accountability for those abuses impossible. Banks routinely claim that they are prevented from disclosing their finance for these companies, but we’ve found that this is a choice banks make. It doesn’t have to be this way. Banks can – and do – write the right to disclose into their contracts when it suits their interests. They must do so when it comes to basic human rights,” said Johan Frijns, Director at BankTrack.
In BankTrack’s analysis, HSBC was the bank found most often to cite client confidentiality as an obstacle to disclosing its clients, representing a total of 7 per cent of all responses audited (11 of 150). The research finds that banks based in the UK, Canada and Asia are the least likely to disclose their clients, with those in mainland Europe the most transparent. Transparency varies significantly across banks in both the USA and Australia.
The findings of the report point to the huge importance of transparency commitments being part and parcel of every sustainability commitment. The ongoing revision of the Equator Principles, a risk management framework adopted by financial institutions to assess and manage environmental and social risk, and UN’s Principles for Responsible Banking, which are currently being drafted, both provide opportunity for the banking sector to strengthen such commitments. 
“Victims cannot engage with the banks backing companies that have abused them if those banks will not even confirm whether they are involved. More transparency is critical if industry standards to assess and manage environmental and social risk are to function. As revision of the Equator Principles is currently underway, banks have the opportunity to affect a step change in transparency by making public disclosure of all transactions a condition of all their future lending,” said Johan Frijns.
Responding to the report’s findings, Christian Donaldson, IFI Economic Justice Policy Advisor at Oxfam, said: “Development finance is increasingly being delivered via financial intermediaries such as commercial banks. For vulnerable and marginalized communities, the need for transparency and disclosure of such transactions including project-related information is real and urgent. But bank confidentiality practices represent the first major challenge to this approach for development finance.  In Oxfam’s view, it is an impossible situation for the banks to make sustainability and human rights commitments and then fail to provide the necessary and relevant information for these commitments to be assessed or monitored in practice by communities, investors, or CSOs alike.”

Nijmegen, the Netherlands ",Banking on Climate Change – Fossil Fuel Finance Report Card 2019 ,Agricultural Bank of  ,China,RWE ,energy plants - coal | energy plants - nuclear | mining - coal ,Germany,"
A report released today by BankTrack, Rainforest Action Network, Indigenous Environmental Network, Oil Change International, Sierra Club and Honor the Earth, and endorsed by 163 organisations around the world, reveals that 33 global banks have provided $1.9 trillion to fossil fuel companies since the adoption of the Paris climate accord at the end of 2015. The amount of financing has risen in each of the past two years. 

 

Of this $1.9 trillion total, $600 billion went to 100 companies that are most aggressively expanding fossil fuels. Alarmingly, these findings reveal that the business practices of the world’s major banks continue to be aligned with climate disaster and stand in sharp contrast to the recent IPCC special report on global warming. That report, Global Warming of 1.5 °C, clearly outlined the critical need for a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels and estimates that the world's clean energy investment needs are $2.4 trillion per year up to 2035.

 
Banking on Climate Change 2019 is the tenth annual fossil fuel report card and the first ever analysis of funding from the world’s major private banks for the fossil fuel sector as a whole.

 

Expanded in scope, the report adds up lending and underwriting to 1,800 companies across the coal, oil and gas sectors globally over the past three years. The report also tracks fossil fuel expansion by aggregating data on which banks are financing the 100 companies most aggressively expanding fossil fuels.

 
Banking on Climate Change 2019 reveals that the four biggest global bankers of fossil fuels are all U.S. banks – JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citi and Bank of America. Barclays of England, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) of Japan and RBC of Canada are also massive funders in this sector.  Notably, JPMorgan Chase is by far the worst banker of fossil fuels and fossil fuel expansion – and therefore the world’s worst banker of climate change. Since the Paris Agreement, JPMorgan Chase has provided $196 billion in finance for fossil fuels, 10% of all fossil fuel finance from the 33 major global banks.

 

JPMorgan’s volume of finance for fossil fuels 2016-2018 is a shocking 29% higher than the second placed bank, Wells Fargo. The bank stands out even more from its peers in its volume of financing for the top companies expanding fossil fuel extraction and infrastructure: since the Paris climate agreement, JPMorgan Chase’s $67 billion in finance for the expanders is fully 68% higher than that of Citi, in distant second place.

 

With Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs in 11th and 12th places respectively in the fossil fuel financing league table, all of the big six U.S. banking giants are in the top dirty dozen bankers of climate change. Together, U.S. banks account for 37% of all global fossil fuel financing. Collectively, the U.S. banks are the biggest source of funding for fossil fuel expansion since the Paris Agreement was adopted.

 

Barclays, the top European banker of fracking and coal, leads as the worst European bank, with $85 billion poured into fossil fuels and $24 billion into expansion. Japan’s worst fossil fuel bank, MUFG, funded $80 billion in fossil fuels overall and $25 billion in fossil fuel expansion. RBC, the world’s top banker of tar sands, leads in Canada, banking fossil fuels at $101 billion. The world’s top banker of coal power, Bank of China, qualifies as China’s worst banker of fossil fuels, with $17 billion funneled into expansion from 2016-2018.

 

The report also grades banks' future-facing policies regarding specific fossil fuel sectors and fossil fuels overall. In assessing restrictions on financing for fossil fuel expansion, no banks scored above a C-range grade, and most bank grades were in the D range. No banks have made commitments to phase-out fossil fuel financing in alignment with a 1.5°C-aligned Paris-compliant trajectory, despite the fact that numerous banks and bankers – including JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon – have declared their support for the Paris Agreement.

 

The report also analyzes the banks’ unacceptably poor performance on human rights, particularly Indigenous rights, as it relates to the impacts of specific fossil fuel projects, and climate change in general.

 

The case studies detailed in the report – from the Indigenous-led opposition to each of the three major proposed tar sands oil pipelines in North America, to the fragile Arctic National Wildlife Refuge under threat from drilling, to German utility RWE’s plans to expand an open-pit lignite coal mine while destroying the 12,000-year-old Hambach Forest – all highlight that banks lack effective energy and human rights policies to prevent them from financing these highly problematic projects and the companies behind them.

Statements

 
Alison Kirsch, Climate and Energy Lead Researcher at Rainforest Action Network:

""Alarming is an understatement. This report is a red alert. The massive scale at which global banks continue to pump billions of dollars into fossil fuels is flatly incompatible with a liveable future. It's an insult to logic, to science and to humanity that since the groundbreaking Paris Climate Agreement, financing for fossil fuels continues to rise. If banks don't rapidly phase out their support for dirty energy, planetary collapse from man-made climate change is not just probable – it is imminent.""

 
Johan Frijns, Director of BankTrack:

""We’re faced with ever worsening climate change impacts worldwide, and the latest IPCC report provides a stark 2030 deadline for the deep cuts in global CO2 emissions needed to avoid full climate breakdown. Yet banks continue to throw their billions at the fossil fuel industry, while announcing minor policy tweaks here and endorsements of the latest toothless ‘responsible finance’ initiative there. One wonders what on earth it will take for banks to finally change course and fully abandon the fossil fuel sector. Campaigners will be demanding exactly this at this year’s upcoming bank AGMs, armed with this report’s shocking new findings.”

 
Tom Goldtooth, Executive Director of Indigenous Environmental Network:

""These banks are funding a future that will cost the well-being of the next seven generations of life and beyond. Indigenous prophecy now meets scientific prediction. Mother Earth and Father Sky is out of balance. Indigenous knowledge and western science both clearly demand that we must rapidly divest from fossil fuels in order to avoid complete climate disaster. Any financial institution that refuses to take action should be stripped of its social license to operate and be held accountable for its investments.""

 
Stephen Kretzmann, Executive Director of Oil Change International:

""We’re deep in a hole on climate. There are people making ladders, and they think we can make it to the top, but there are also people making shovels, and every day they dig the hole deeper. The people with the ladders don’t think they’ll be able to reach the top if the hole gets much deeper. The banks in this report are funding the people with shovels, devoting billions to the expansion of fossil fuel reserves which, when burned, will ensure the failure of the Paris Climate Agreement. Financing the expansion of any part of the oil, gas, or coal industry is now clearly climate denial, and we demand that it stop.""

 
Ben Cushing, Sierra Club Beyond Dirty Fuels Campaign Representative: 

""At a time when science tells us we need to rapidly transition to clean energy, major American banks are placing themselves on the wrong side of history by continuing to offer a blank check to the fossil fuel industry. The global outcry for financial institutions to stop financing climate destruction will only grow louder and more powerful until these banks get the message and pull their support for dirty fossil fuels once and for all.""

 
Tara Houska, Campaigns Director of Honor The Earth:

""Financial institutions are funding the destruction of our planet. Climate crisis is a reality that will be shared by every living being – we need change, we need it now. It is a question of our shared survival that banks must respond to. We cannot drink money.""

Conakry ",Thirteen Guinean villages lodge complaint against World Bank for financing destructive bauxite mine,BNP Paribas ,France,Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinée (CBG) ,mining - non coal,Guinea,"
Residents of 13 villages in western Guinea have filed a formal complaint against the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the World Bank’s private-sector arm, for funding the expansion of a harmful bauxite mine. The 540 complainants allege that the IFC-financed project, Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinée, has grabbed their land, destroyed their livelihoods and damaged the local environment.
The complaint, filed with the IFC’s independent watchdog, the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman, details violations of the IFC’s environmental and social Performance Standards and international law. Most of the world’s development banks have established such grievance mechanisms to monitor compliance with their environmental and social policies and address complaints from impacted communities.
The complainants are seeking full and fair redress for the harms they have suffered, along with protection from future violations. They have asked the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman to facilitate mediations with the IFC and Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinée to address their grievances.
“The lands on which we and our ancestors have lived and farmed for centuries have been almost totally consumed by CBG,” said Mamadou Lamarana Bah, one of the complainants.  “With no more land, no more forests, no more water, how are we going to survive?
The villagers have lost agricultural land, which has led to a significant decline in their incomes and quality of life, and access to their water resources, which have been polluted, among other harmful impacts. The situation is especially perilous for the residents of Hamdallaye village, who have been told by the company that they will be imminently resettled, without their consent, in a former mining area that was not properly rehabilitated.
The complainants are being represented by two Guinean organizations, Centre du Commerce International pour le Developpement (CECIDE) and Association pour le développement rural et l’entraide mutuelle en Guinée (ADREMGUI), and the U.S. human rights organization Inclusive Development International.
The impoverished nation of Guinea is home to the world’s largest bauxite reserves. Mining companies have flooded the country in recent years, despite serious social and environmental concerns raised by Human Rights Watch and others. Bauxite mined by Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinée is processed into aluminum that is used by major consumer brands to make cars, beverage cans and technology. Yet few Guineans benefit from such projects.
“International mining companies have been making a fortune off of Guinea’s rich mineral resources, while the communities impacted by mining have quite literally been left in the dust,"" said Mathilde Chiffert, West Africa Legal Coordinator for Inclusive Development International.  “It’s high time for local communities to get a fair share of the benefits from mineral extraction.”
Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinée is a joint venture between the Guinean government; the U.S. aluminum corporation Alcoa; the Anglo-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto; and the Guernsey-registered Dadco. In 2016, the IFC provided a $200 million loan to expand the venture’s mining operations, with the U.S. government’s Overseas Private Investment Corporation providing an additional $150 million.
A further $473 million came from a syndicate of commercial banks: France’s Société Générale, BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole and Natixis; the German affiliate of ING bank, ING-DiBa; and two Guinean banks, Société Générale de Banques en Guinée and Banque Internationale pour le Commerce et l’Industrie de la Guinée, a member of the BNP Paribas group.
The German government guaranteed a portion of the financing through its Untied Loan Guarantees program.
Since it began operations in 1973, Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinée has mined large areas of land in the area surrounding the town of Sangaredi, located in the lush Boké region. For years, the joint venture has denied the land rights of local communities, creating immense frustration among the population.
“We look forward to engaging in an equitable dialogue process with CBG, facilitated by an independent mediator to resolve the long-standing grievances of the complainants,” said Tenguiano Pascal, Executive Director of CECIDE.
The complaint is available at:

",Global Witness celebrates significant agreement and shift in mind-set from the EU on investor due diligence,,,,,,"



The European Parliament and Council have today reached a provisional political agreement on a new set of rules requiring European investors such as banks, pension funds and insurers, to carry out due diligence.
This means investors will need to disclose the steps they have taken to address the adverse impact of their investment decisions on people and planet.
The agreement, which was reached in the early hours of this morning, also fundamentally redefines the risks that investors must consider when decision making – moving away from pure financial risk to their profits, and towards risks to human rights and our global environment.
Global Witness, who have been long campaigning for a more ethical and sustainable financial sector in the EU, today celebrated the historic agreement.
The anti-corruption NGO has previously highlighted how Europeans’ money – and EU-based investors – far too often play a key role in funding projects linked to human rights abuses, land grabs and large-scale environmental destruction. They have highlighted examples from oil exploration in Africa’s oldest national park to a mining project in India which sparked violent protests.
Investors across Europe play a powerful role in improving the overseas and European operations of the companies they invest in. By using their significant leverage, they can insist on higher environmental, social and governance standards in the companies and projects they invest in.
Richard Gardiner, EU Campaigner, Global Witness said:
“This agreement is an important step forward in ensuring EU investors can no longer be blind to the environmental and human rights abuses carried out by the companies they invest in. It will lead to greater investor accountability and understanding of the impact that investors have on climate change and human rights abuses.”
The NGO pointed towards the recent Brumadinho dam burst in Brazil, which left over a hundred people dead and hundreds missing. Following the disaster, Brazilian regulators have ordered mining company Vale, who operated the dam, to suspend activity in this and two more of its mines. On Friday Vale’s CEO also resigned. 

This example makes it clear that voluntary mechanisms are not enough to tackle the corporate damage done to communities, and our environment, is no longer cost-free.- Rachel Owens, Head of EU Advocacy, Global Witness







Rachel Owens, Head of EU Advocacy, Global Witness said: 
“80% of investors in Vale, the company at the heart of this devastating mining dam disaster, were signed up to the UN’s Principles for Responsible Investing – but missed major red flags such as concerns around the land being secured illegally. The EU has today agreed to rules for investors to ensure they no longer bankroll projects and companies who cause harm to people and planet.”
""It is also especially encouraging to see pension funds in scope - which huge amounts of ordinary people's funds flow through.
“What's more, this EU decision sets a global example for other governments to follow suit. For the UK, to remain competitive in a post-Brexit landscape it must implement similar or more stringent rules for investors.”
The rules still however, the NGO said, have weaknesses. 
On top of this, investors will initially only be subject to a ‘comply or explain’ compliance mechanism, although it will become mandatory for large investors after 18 months. This means that investors themselves will need to determine whether they consider the adverse impacts of the investment decisions or not.
‘There is a real risk that investors intent on putting profit before people could continue to ignore the substantial environmental, social and governance risks as regulators will have fewer tools to challenge those investors that do not comply with the rules. The Commission and Regulators must strictly enforce these rules, and challenge those investors that do not comply, and do not satisfactorily justify why their investments are not contributing to human rights or environmental abuses. Only through strict enforcement can the goals of these rules be fully achieved,” Owens confirmed.
The new rules are a cornerstone of the EU’s Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth which was launched in March last year. The EU is currently leading the way on ensuring finance is re-orientated towards sustainable economic activity.

",Investors hold HSBC’s feet to the fire on coal,HSBC ,United Kingdom,,,,"
Major HSBC shareholders are today calling on the global bank to restrict its dangerous and excessive financing of the coal industry.
In an action coordinated by responsible investment charity ShareAction, a group of HSBC shareholders with over $1tr in assets either under management or stewardship* have sent a letter to the CEO of the global bank, John Flint. The group – which includes Schroders and Hermes EOS, a leading stewardship provider – are asking the bank to strengthen its coal policy by ending finance to coal-reliant companies and by excluding future financing of coal projects in certain emerging markets.  
Investors could face the knock-on effects of investing in banks still tied up in coal, as legislation clamps down on fossil fuels and the energy mix moves towards cleaner energy sources.  
Unlike many of its peers, such as Standard Chartered and Barclays, HSBC has failed to institute a global exclusion policy for coal power project finance. Instead, HSBC’s policy allows it to continue financing coal power projects in Bangladesh, Vietnam and Indonesia. ShareAction has been campaigning on this since HSBC’s AGM last year. 
Similarly, HSBC has so far failed to take a prudent stance on corporate finance – for example, in the form of general loans to companies – enabling the bank to continue indirectly financing and underwriting companies that are highly reliant on coal.  
As such, the group, which also includes EdenTree, has written to HSBC asking that they adopt:  

A prohibition of project finance to new coal mines and coal-fired power plants anywhere in the world, including Indonesia, Bangladesh and Vietnam; 
A prohibition of general corporate financing, underwriting and advisory services to companies that are highly dependent on coal mining or coal power; 
A clear, timebound plan to phase out existing exposure to coal-related assets. 

Extensive research has shown that there is a clear path to renewables in Indonesia, Vietnam and Bangladesh. Yet by financing coal power sector expansion in these three countries, HSBC is facilitating the lock-in of high-carbon infrastructure and avoidable emissions; and failing to support these countries in the transition to a low-carbon economy. 
It is widely acknowledged that no new coal plants can be built anywhere to keep temperature rises to well below two degrees of warming. 
This action follows several successful investor engagements on climate change, which saw Glencore most recently agreeing to limit its coal production. 
Sonia Hierzig, Senior Projects Manager at ShareAction, said: “Coal’s time is up. The time for forceful investor action on climate change is now. Whether targeted at high-carbon companies or at the financial institutions keeping them alive, investor engagement is working. It is time HSBC listened to its shareholders and faced the facts: coal poses a climatic and financial risk too great to bear.” 
Roland Bosch, Associate Director at Hermes EOS, said: “We expect that financing new coal-fired power will prove to be highly risky, given the increasing competitiveness of renewables, and is incompatible with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Although HSBC has not financed any new coal-fired power plants since the release of its new energy policy, we want to see the bank evolve its policy to rule out all investment in coal and instead to focus on financing low-carbon energy across emerging markets.” 
Esmé van Herwijnen, Responsible Investment Analyst – Climate Change Lead at Edentree, said: “We support urgent moves that lead to HSBC strengthening its policy on new coal investments. Alongside some of its peers such as Barclays and ING, we believe the time has come for HSBC to institute a global coal exclusion policy that makes a firm commitment to end the financing of coal reliant projects within a clearly defined time frame. The IPCC has made it clear that there can be no future for coal in a 1.5-degree scenario and, as shareholders, we are urging HSBC to show leadership in this vital area” 
Jack Bertolus, Research Coordinator at Market Forces, said: “Harvard University researchers project that by 2030, pollution from coal-fired power plants could result in 43,620 excess deaths in Indonesia and Vietnam every year. The Executive Director of the International Energy Agency has warned that ‘we have no room to build anything that emits CO2 emissions.’ Yet HSBC continues to actively support pollution, from a controversial coal port in Bangladesh to coal-fired power stations in Vietnam. The bank must recognise that developing countries have as much as right as their developed counterparts to clean energy and clean air. HSBC should immediately rule out all funding to new coal, no matter the location.”

","Every two weeks a bank, insurer or lender announces new coal restrictions",ABN AMRO ,Netherlands,,,,"
New research from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) today reveals over 100 major global financial institutions have introduced policies restricting coal funding.
The report 'Over 100 Global Financial Institutions Are Exiting Coal, With More to Come' finds global capital is fleeing the coal sector at an electrifying rate.
Since 2013, coal exit announcements have occurred at a rate of over one per month from globally significant banks and insurers holding more than US$10bn worth of assets under management.
The report found that since the start of 2018, there have been 34 new or significantly improved announcements from global financial institutions restricting coal.
On average, there is one new announcement every two weeks. 
The World Bank announced the first ever restrictions in 2013, with the 100th announcement in December 2018 coming from the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) removing three country exceptions to its coal finance ban.
A further five policies have been announced since the beginning of 2019 with moves coming from Nedbank of South Africa, Barclays Bank UK, Export Development Canada, and Varma of Finland. The latest move announced just last week was from Austria’s Vienna Insurance Group saying it will no longer insure new coal plants and mines.
Report author Tim Buckley, Director of Energy Finance Studies, IEEFA, says when globally significant investors act, global momentum increases.
“For environmental, reputational and financial reasons, thermal coal is a toxic asset for global investors increasingly announcing new and improved policies responding to climate change,” said Buckley.
“The strong leadership of a few globally significant institutions five years ago is increasingly turning into capital flight by the many, with one new announcement every two weeks in recent years.
“The pattern of tightening existing policies combined with new lending restrictions is creating a domino effect within the global financial industry while resulting in a progressive strangulation of the thermal coal industry.
“Stranded assets are a clear financial risk for any institutions left funding the coal sector.
“With investors understandably focused on cheaper, sustainable, domestic renewables - which are clearly becoming the backbone technology of choice for energy systems going forward, an emerging theme is coal companies’ inability to access capital markets for expansions, mergers or acquisitions.
“The pace of change is electrifying.""
The 100+ financial institutions restricting coal lending includes 40% of the top 40 global banks and as of last week, at least 20 globally significant insurers with more than $6 trillion of investments – 20% of the industry’s global assets – who are excluding coal from their portfolios. 
Financial institutions' coal restrictions are coupled with the withdrawal of other essential support. Eight insurers and reinsurers, including industry giants like AXA, Allianz, Swiss Re and Munich Re, have ended or restricted their insurance for coal projects, making it increasingly challenging for companies to find cover.
Since the beginning of 2018 there have been 34 coal restriction policies announced, with 25 being new and another nine building on earlier coal-related commitments. Notably, these restrictions are beginning to come from Asian financial institutions led by Dai-ichi Life of Japan and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, which are rapidly aligning with their European and U.S. counterparts.
Meanwhile, some institutions in Europe and the U.S. have some catching up to do. Whilst New York City’s pension funds have pledged to divest from fossil fuels, the New York State Common Retirement Fund, the third largest pension fund in the U.S., has so far failed to act.
“Our report shows that coal finance restrictions are increasingly emerging across the globe, from New York to South Africa, Brazil to Japan,” said Buckley.
“While initial measures vary in effectiveness, we found that the trend is for financial institutions to ratchet up the strength of policies once they are in place.
“With environmental and reputational concerns certainly driving factors for capital fleeing coal, investors are also increasingly aware that coal industry forecasts are increasingly dour.”
The unexpected US$18bn collapse into bankruptcy of Peabody Energy in 2016 and more recently the US$150bn collapse in value of General Electric shows the magnitude of capital destruction for investors who continue to ignore the energy system transformation. The ongoing financial distress at Wiggins Island Coal Export Terminal (WICET) in Queensland for most of this decade has bankrupted four Australian coal mining firms and cost banks and investors billions.
“With the energy transition to cheaper technologies gathering pace, the likelihood of investors having to wear billions of dollars in additional stranded assets is impossible to ignore,” said Buckley.
“The smart money is jumping ship. The only question now is, who’s next?”

Geneva, Switzerland ",Credit Suisse and UBS financing massive greenhouse gas emissions – new report,Credit Suisse ,Switzerland,,,,"
A report commissioned by Greenpeace Switzerland has revealed the level of greenhouse gas emissions which Credit Suisse and UBS have been responsible for between 2015 and 2017. By financing companies active in extreme fossil fuels, the top two Swiss banks are responsible for the emission of 182.9 million tonnes of greenhouse gases. In 2017 alone, Credit Suisse and UBS financed 93.9 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions, double the level of Switzerland’s annual emissions. The bulk of these emissions have been financed by Credit Suisse, finds the new report. 
Credit Suisse and UBS remain heavily involved in companies active in fossil fuels. Research commissioned by Greenpeace Switzerland last year shows that, between 2015 and 2017, the two banks made available USD 12.3 billion for 47 companies exploiting fossil fuels deemed extreme, namely coal, oil from tar sands, the Arctic and deep seabed, and liquefied natural gas. 
Greenpeace Switzerland commissioned both ISS-Ethix in Zurich to calculate the emissions resulting from this financing and right.based on science in Frankfurt to evaluate them. The report shows that in 2015, 2016 and 2017 the two major Swiss banks financed the emission of 182.9 million tonnes of greenhouse gases via USD 12.3 billion. Credit Suisse was found to be responsible for more than two thirds of these emissions. Between 2015 and 2017, the bank trebled its financed emissions, as a result in particular of its support for coal. At UBS, a steady decline in financed emissions was found over the period.
Two years after the signing of the Paris Climate Agreement, 2017 saw Credit Suisse and UBS deliver the greatest climate damage via financed emissions of 93.9 million tonnes of greenhouse gases from the 47 companies studied. This amounts to approximately double the annual emissions of Switzerland.  Responsible for 82.6 million tonnes, Credit Suisse was the most implicated in this climate-damaging financing.
Eleven of the companies financed by Credit Suisse and UBS, among them Duke Energy, BP, American Electric Power and RWE, are known to be active in the climate-sceptic lobby, the goal of which is to prevent or hinder climate protection legislation. 
Risks for companies and banks
With their financing, Credit Suisse and UBS are not only harming the climate, they are taking major risks themselves. The new report analysed the extent to which 34 of the 47 companies are subject to physical climate-related risks – for example, extreme weather events such as heavy rainfalls, storms and heatwaves – and how soon these risks may occur. Among other things it is evident that, compared to UBS, Credit Suisse is channelling more resources at companies exposed to high weather risks in the short term. 
Katya Nikitenko, Finance specialist at Greenpeace Switzerland, commented: 
""As climate risks become reality, from both a physical and regulatory point of view, banks risk losing a lot of their investments. This is why more and more investors and banks are viewing climate change to be a financial risk and not just a risk to their reputation.
""This report shows once again that Credit Suisse and UBS are fueling climate change. They should be playing an active and leading role in the transition to a low-carbon economy.""
Greenpeace is calling on the two big banks to show the public concretely how they intend to align their financial flows with the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. There is also a need for an immediate exit from the financing of companies involved in the coal and tar sands sectors.

A summary is also available at: https://www.greenpeace.ch/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Greenpeace_FactSheet_EN.pdf
It should be noted that between 2015 and 2017 the ecological footprint of the two banks is likely to have been much higher than shown in this report. It takes into account the effects on the climate of the banks’ financing of a limited number of only 47 companies active in extreme fossil energies. 
2. See the 2018 report ‘Swiss Banks at the End of the Fossil Fuel Age’
This report was based on the ‘Banking on Climate Change: Fossil Fuel Finance Report Card 2018’, produced by Rainforest Action Network, BankTrack, Indigenous Environmental Network, Oil Change International, Sierra Club and Honor The Earth, and supported by more than 50 organisations around the globe including Greenpeace USA. 
Extreme fossil fuels are unconventional hydrocarbons such as extreme oils (oil sands, oil extracted from the Arctic and the seabed, liquefied natural gas (LNG), coal mining and coal-fired power plants. This categorisation of fossil fuels is based on reports from the Carbon Tracker Initiative, which identifies oil and gas projects with the highest financial risks when it comes to limiting global warming to well below 2°C. The coal sector is implicated because of its incompatibility with climate stability and its severe effects on the environment, health and human rights.

Paris, France ",Trans Adriatic Pipeline: France provides massive financial support to controversial gas project,Bank of  ,China,Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) ,oil and gas,- international -,"
The European Investment Bank (EIB) has announced that the required financing of € 3.9 billion for the development of the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) project was finally put in place in December 2018.  Among the list of project supporters are the public investment bank BpiFrance, the credit insurance company Euler Hermes, and the commercial banks Société Générale, BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole and Natixis. 
Friends of the Earth France has criticised this scandalous, blanket support from France’s public and private sectors for a useless project, which flies in the face of the climate emergency and also threatens local communities.
Seventeen commercial banks in total are taking part in this loan alongside the EIB and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). Among them, four French banks: Société Générale (the financial adviser for the project), BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole and Natixis. The TAP project is also benefitting from direct support from the French government, through guarantees granted by the public investment bank Bpifrance of 450 million euros and the credit insurance company Euler Hermes – part owned by the French state – of 280 million euros.  
The TAP gas project is controversial for various reasons. The benefits it will bring in terms of security of supply for Europe - the main justification for the project – have been called into question due to the development of other gas projects on the continent.  In Italy, one of the transit countries, an investigation is currently under way focused on 15 industry representatives alleged to have been involved in environmental and administrative violations.  Friends of the Earth France denounces the European strategy of proliferating gas infrastructures, which is acting as a brake on the clean energy transition.
Lorette Philippot, private finance campaigner at Friends of the Earth France, said: 
""For months, we have been questioning the public and private banks, asking them not to support this mega gas pipeline which is completely at odds with the fight against climate change and is already producing serious social and economic impacts on communities in the vicinity of the project."" 
However, the banks have made every effort to make TAP possible. Société Générale advises the consortium on the development of the project, the loans from the EIB and the EBRD provide a political guarantee to the project, the guarantees from Bpifrance and Euler Hermes limit the project risks for commercial banks, and the latter ultimately provide the bulk of the capital.
Cécile Marchand, campaigner on climate and public actors at Friends of the Earth France, commented: 
""There is no good reason for the French government to justify its direct support for the TAP gas project. Throwing out the Paris Agreement to help French companies export is intolerable. It is high time for France to reflect on its support for fossil fuels via its export credit agency.""
According to Friends of the Earth France’s calculations based on Bpifrance Assurance Export publications, the public institution has provided approximately €1.4 billion to the fossil fuel sector since 2017.  Friends of the Earth France is calling on the government of Edouard Philippe to go further than the commitments made by the previous government and exclude all fossil fuels from export credit agency support, and not just coal.
Notes for editors:

Nijmegen ","Barclays’ energy policy review: ‘Half measures’ not good enough, says BankTrack",Barclays ,United Kingdom,Keystone XL pipeline ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,United States,"
A new energy and climate change statement from Barclays, described by the bank as “supporting the transition to a low carbon economy, while also ensuring that global energy needs continue to be met responsibly,” is shot through with ‘half measures’, according to BankTrack. 
Greig Aitken, Coal campaigner at BankTrack, said:
“Despite Barclays’ claims, the new policy measures lack the necessary ambition to adequately contribute to combating climate change or to safeguard the health and rights of communities around the world directly affected by fossil fuel projects. These are disappointing half measures when the worsening climate crisis now demands that banks end their financial support for fossil fuels completely.”  
BankTrack’s assessment of the measures introduced by Barclays, to cover its “necessary financing” going forward for carbon intensive and high impact sources of energy, finds the bank failing most starkly on its approach towards financing for tar sands.
Barclays has committed to introducing ‘enhanced due diligence’ for clients and transactions in both the tar sands and Arctic oil sectors. Yet while 13 European banks now have some form of exclusion or restriction on financing for tar sands projects,  and 11 European banks have done the same for Arctic oil and/or gas projects,  Barclays’ new statement contains no form of exclusion or restriction on financing to these sectors.
Barclays has provided regular financing in recent years to TransCanada, the company behind the controversial Keystone XL tar sands pipeline, and its overall financing to tar sands companies rose in 2017 to $1.84 billion, making it the largest private sector bank supporter of tar sands outside north America.   
Claire Hamlett, Climate campaigner at BankTrack, said:
“Barclays lags behind even the partial policies of its British peers on tar sands. For example, HSBC, Standard Chartered and RBS have all at least excluded project finance for some tar sands projects.
“But the big money supporting tar sands expansion is coming in the form of corporate finance. By lending to companies like TransCanada, Barclays is supporting massive fossil fuel expansion projects that the climate cannot afford and that Indigenous communities do not want. These new policy measures will do nothing for the transition to a low carbon economy and clearly do not represent a responsible, sustainable approach, as the bank is claiming.”
More positively, Barclays’ new energy and climate change statement sees the bank committing to no longer provide project finance for coal mining and coal power globally. These policy changes make Barclays the twenty-second major international bank to commit to ending project finance for new thermal coal mines, and the twentieth to do the same for new coal plants worldwide. 
The new statement, however, places no definitive restrictions on Barclays continuing to “provide general corporate financing for current corporate clients that own and operate existing thermal coal mines and coal-fired power stations.”
Greig Aitken, Coal campaigner at BankTrack, said:
“Three years on from the ink on the Paris Agreement drying, it is good to see Barclays take a meaningful step forward by ending its direct finance for coal mining and coal power projects globally. In terms of responsible climate action, this move takes it beyond HSBC, which is regrettably still open to financing coal power projects in Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam.
“However, these new policy prescriptions on coal financing do not address the reason Barclays last year became Europe’s third biggest private sector bank supporter of companies planning coal power expansion around the world. Our recently published research shows that this was driven by Barclays’ issuing of bonds via underwriting for these companies. In 2018, the beneficiaries of Barclays’ underwriting services included Adani, National Thermal Power Company of India and RWE, companies which are involved in destructive, highly controversial coal development activities in Australia, Bangladesh and Germany.   
“At a time when no finance should be going to new fossil fuels, as demanded by the ‘Fossil Banks, No Thanks!’ campaign, it’s alarming that Barclays remains a heavy supporter of new coal development via its underwriting business. It has taken three years for Barclays to make a meaningful policy move on coal. Campaigners will be upping the pressure to get Barclays out of coal quickly and for good.”
Research published by BankTrack and partner organisations in December shows that while Barclays’ lending for the top 120 coal plant developer companies has been in sharp decline over the last three years, its mobilisation of capital for these companies via underwriting services has more than doubled since 2016 to $1.32 billion for the first nine months of 2018.

",Ten of the best – BankTrack's 2018 end-of-year round-up,,,,,,"
Welcome to our end-of-year round-up, in which we look back at BankTrack's biggest moments of 2018, our fifteenth anniversary year.


Thank you for reading! If you support BankTrack's work and would like to help us do more, please consider a one-off gift, or even better, a monthly donation - see our Donate page for details.






10. Judge dismisses case against BankTrack in full

			Last year, Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the Dakota Access Pipeline, served BankTrack with a lawsuit claiming millions of US dollars that, lets face it, we don't have, based on spurious claims about our supposed involvement in directing acts of “radical ecoterrorism”. In June, a North Dakota district judge threw the company's claim out of court. A victory for common sense and a strong rebuke to the tactic of 'strategic lawsuits against public participation'.




9. Standard Chartered and RBS pass first coal tests - but HSBC must try harder

			2018 saw some of the British banks finally get the message on coal. HSBC disappointed in April, however, with a new policy that allowed continued finance for coal power projects in Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam – some of its most important growth markets. RBS, Lloyds and Standard Chartered did better by stopping direct finance for new coal plants worldwide, with no exceptions. A full-page NGO ad in FT Asia helped make the case to Standard Chartered.




8. Our Campaigners' Gathering and 15th birthday

			In the first week of October we held our second Campaigners' Gathering, welcoming over 50 campaigners from some 35 different organisations to Kleve in Germany to discuss strategies, learn from each others' experiences and make plans for driving the banking sector forward – and out of fossil fuels! At the end of the week we returned over the border to BankTrack's home town of Nijmegen to celebrate our 15th Birthday Party with music, stories and much dancing.




7. Tracking Dutch banks on human rights 

			In August, making up for lost time, the Dutch Banking Sector Agreement on Human Rights published three reports at once: its first Annual Report and papers on Increasing Leverage and the cocoa value chain. These are the first substantial output since the agreement was signed in October 2016. We've been busy evaluating these outputs in a series of articles. Amid delays and mixed results, some progress has been made but much more needs to be done to deliver concrete improvements on the ground.




6. Kick-starting debate on banks and grievance mechanisms

			Banks to date have made precious little progress towards meeting their responsibilities to ensure communities can get justice from banks through grievance mechanisms. In July we released a briefing paper with Oxfam Australia to set out banks' responsibilities and examine what such mechanisms could look like in practice. We also held two webinars in September to promote the report. In November an Australian government body ordered ANZ to establish a grievance mechanism, and more look set to follow.


P

5. Report Card shows surge in finance for extreme fossil fuels
In March we were part of the coalition which released the ninth edition of the Fossil Fuel Finance Report Card, showing an alarming surge in finance for 'extreme' fossil fuels including tar sands, Arctic and ultra-deepwater oil, LNG export, and coal. Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto Dominion Bank and JPMorgan Chase passed the coal-heavy Chinese banks to become the biggest bankers of extreme fossil fuels. The report was covered in the FT, Guardian, Bloombergand Huffington Post.





4. Calling for commitments at Principles for Responsible Banking launch in Paris

			November saw UNEP launch the first draft Principles for Responsible Banking in Paris, with 28 banks signed up so far. We were there at the launch to point out that the Principles – under which banks promise to align their business strategies with the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals – lack any specific, timed commitments to make sure that alignment actually happens. Read our reaction to the Principles here.




3. Indigenous leaders meet Equator banks in Downtown DC

			After BankTrack's 'Equator Banks, Act!'campaign in 2017 helped prompt an update to the Equator Principles (project finance guidelines followed by 98 banks), we made sure our presence was felt at the annual meeting of Principles signatories in Washington DC in October, convening a side-meeting between the Indigenous Women's Divestment Delegation, civil society activists and Equator banks. (Image: Sierra Club via Twitter).




2. New data on banks financing coal power expansion released at COP24

			While the IPCC and the UN issued their latest stark warnings on the need for an accelerated phase-out of coal power, the global coal plant fleet is still expanding. At the UN Climate Summit in Katowice, Poland in December, BankTrack and Urgewald released updated data on the banks and investors supporting the frightening pipeline of new coal projects. The research revealed that the list of the largest lenders is led by Japanese banks Mizuho and Mitsubishi, with Citi, HSBC, Standard Chartered and ING joining them in the top 10. 




1. 'Fossil Banks, No Thanks!' Global Call launched

			Climate change is running faster than we are, as UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned in Katowice recently, and avoiding climate breakdown requires a complete stop to new fossil fuel projects and a rapid shift to green energy. It's time for banks to get on board with this, and end their financing for fossil fuels. October saw BankTrack launch Fossil Banks, No Thanks!, fast becoming a global rallying cry for activists and concerned citizens everywhere. Stay tuned for more in 2019!

London ",Banking giant HSBC divests from Israeli arms manufacturer following pressure from human rights campaigners,HSBC ,United Kingdom,Elbit Systems ,arms industry and trade | aviation | security and surveillance systems,Israel,"

HSBC confirmed to campaigners that it has fully divested from Israeli drone manufacturer Elbit Systems, which sells weapons to the Israeli military used in attacks on Palestinians.
Over 24,000 people emailed HSBC with concern over its investments in Elbit Systems and other companies selling weapons to Israel’s military, and 40 HSBC branches across the UK were picketed monthly for the same reason.
Campaigners vow to continue the campaign, as HSBC maintains business relations with more than a dozen other companies selling weapons and technology to the Israeli military.

Human rights campaigners have declared a victory as global banking giant HSBC confirmed that it has divested completely from Israeli weapons manufacturer Elbit Systems after a year of campaign pressure.
Elbit Systems is one of Israel’s largest arms manufacturers, notorious for its deadly drones used in attacks on Palestinian civilians, and marketed abroad as ‘combat proven’. The company has also manufactured white phosphorous and artillery systems that can be used for cluster munitions.
Elbit Systems has been excluded from pension and investment funds around the world over the company’s involvement in supplying surveillance systems and other technology to Israel’s Separation Wall and settlements in the West Bank. Elbit has also supplied surveillance technology for use along the U.S.-Mexico’s border.
HSBC’s link with Elbit Systems was first exposed in 2017 in a War on Want report on UK banks’ business dealings with companies selling military equipment and technology to Israel. The campaign calling on HSBC to divest from complicit companies received a critical boost when the Palestine Solidarity Campaign and other groups joined, picketing bank branches across the UK over its connections to Elbit and other companies.
HSBC has a ‘Defence Equipment Sector Policy’ which specifies that the bank would not provide financial services to companies involved in the production or selling of cluster munitions. Campaigners pointed out that its involvement with Elbit Systems, even if ‘on behalf of clients’ as the bank long claimed, violated this policy as well as the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
Elbit Systems is rumoured to be on a list currently being compiled by the UN Human Rights Commissioner of companies that are violating international law by providing support for Israel’s illegal settlement enterprise.
Ryvka Barnard, War on Want’s senior campaigner on militarism and security said:

“HSBC has taken a positive first step in divesting from Elbit Systems, the notorious manufacturer of drones, chemical weapons, cluster bomb artillery systems, and other technology used in attacks against Palestinian civilians, and to militarise walls and borders around the world. Doing business with companies like Elbit means profiting from violence and human rights violation, which is both immoral and a contravention of international law.”


“However, HSBC continues to do business with over a dozen companies selling military equipment and technology used in human rights violation, including Caterpillar, whose bulldozers are used in demolition of Palestinian homes and properties, and BAE Systems, whose weapons are used in war crimes by Israel, Saudi Arabia, and other repressive regimes.”

Ben Jamal, director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) said:

“This announcement is proof positive that collective campaigning works. Hundreds of people around the UK, including many PSC members and branches, were involved in pushing HSBC to divest from Elbit through pickets, email campaigns, and other actions designed to pressure the company. HSBC’s announcement demonstrates the effectiveness of Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions as a tactic against Israel’s continued flouting of international law and human rights. We now call on HSBC to stay true to the principle of ethical investment by cutting links to all companies which support Israel’s military regime.”

Notes:
- HSBC confirmed its decision and informed War on Want and the Palestine Solidarity Campaign via email on 23 December 2018.
- HSBC’s shareholdings in Elbit Systems were first revealed in War on Want’s ‘Deadly Investments’ report in July 2017, and followed up in a letter to the company, detailing Elbit’s complicity in violence and demanding divestment in September 2018.
- For more info on Elbit Systems and exclusion of Elbit by pension and investments funds, see the ‘Investigate’ database.
- Members of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign and other campaigners have held monthly pickets at HSBC branches around the UK, calling for HSBC to divest from Elbit and other companies arming Israel as part of the “Stop Arming Israel” campaign.
- For more on the UN Human Rights Commissioner’s list of companies involved in Israel’s illegal settlements, and rumours of Elbit’s appearance on the list, see this article and this updated Q and A on the list.
- HSBC follows other companies and organisations which have sought to minimise or get rid of ties to war crimes and other violations of Palestinian rights this year, including Airbnb, Quakers in Britain, and Leeds University.

",ANZ Declines to ‘Do the Right Thing’ for Displaced Cambodian Farmers,ANZ ,Australia,,,,"
ANZ Banking Group violated its own policies and international human rights standards by financing a Cambodian sugar company that seized land from local farmers, according to a report released by an Australian government body that monitors corporate behavior overseas. In a rare rebuke of a commercial bank, the Australian National Contact Point (AusNCP) found it “difficult to reconcile” ANZ’s decision to finance Phnom Penh Sugar with the bank’s internal rules and the OECD Guidelines, an ethical business code that the Australian government has endorsed.


Despite CEO Shayne Elliott’s comments to an Australian Parliamentary Standing Committee in response to the report that the bank should do the right the thing, ANZ has decided to keep the profits it earned from the human rights violations in Cambodia, deprive the victims of badly needed redress, and continue to mislead the public about the situation.


In 2011, ANZ provided a $40 million loan to Phnom Penh Sugar, which had forcibly displaced hundreds of local farming families and employed school-aged children in dangerous conditions at its sugarcane plantation in southern Cambodia. The human rights risks of doing business with the sugar company “would likely have been readily apparent” to ANZ, according to the findings. English-language media had regularly reported on the company’s role in land seizures and forced evictions prior to the loan.


Below are four misleading statements made by Shayne Elliott in a letter to interested stakeholders justifying the decision not to provide redress:

Shayne Elliott wrongly claims that the AusNCP report “confirms that ANZ did not fund PPS’ acquisition of land or plantation development, which is at the core of ‘land grab’ claims for compensation.”

AusNCP confirms no such thing.  ANZ never supplied any evidence that its loan to PPS was ring-fenced for the refinery. ANZ merely made this assertion and the AusNCP took it on face value and did not in any way suggest that this somehow mitigated the bank’s responsibility. ANZ is evidently seeking to mislead the public about this distinction. Even if ANZ’s claims are true, the plantation and refinery are two components of a single interdependent project that caused the illegal forced evictions of Cambodian farming families, along with a raft of other human rights violations.

Shayne Elliott wrongly claims that the AusNCP report “confirms that PPS was not a customer of the bank at the time it acquired land for the plantation development.”

ANZ is seeking to mislead stakeholders with this statement. What AusNCP actually confirmed is that at the time ANZ approved the loan to PPS there were regular media reports about land conflicts and illegal forced evictions carried out by PPS. The AusNCP states (para 37-38):


“…there was publicly available information at the time (in 2010) that suggested the existence of risks associated with ANZ’s former client and its project – including the well publicised dispute between PPS and the affected community at around the time that ANZ commenced financing the sugar refinery and factory. For instance, villagers were protesting against the project early in 2010... When its human rights standards were applied to ANZ’s commercial relationship with its former client PPS, it is arguable that most (if not all) of them would not be satisfactorily met.”


Indeed, forced evictions and ongoing human rights violations, including child labour and worker deaths, continued while PPS was a client of ANZ, and ANZ was well aware of this.

Shayne Elliott wrongly claims that the European Union (EU) is involved in a process to attempt to resolve the matter and that this is a viable option available to the claimants to obtain redress.

Despite our repeated communications to ANZ that this is untrue, the bank continues to hide behind this false information. In fact, the EU has taken the unprecedented step of triggering a formal process to withdraw Cambodia’s preferential tariff status because of the government’s failure to address land conflicts among other rights violations.
ANZ is not only misleading the public, but also giving credence to the claims of a corrupt, authoritarian government about a sham remediation process. The government-led process to which ANZ refers is beset by intimidation with take-it-or-leave-it offers to a small fraction of affected households of US$300 for land and property stolen from them.  The vast majority of people affected by sugarcane land grabs across Cambodia have been excluded from the government process.  Shayne Elliott’s assertion that “settlements have been reached with farmers in three of four affected provinces” is simply not true.

Shayne Elliott claims that ANZ has committed to ‘zero tolerance’ for improper land acquisition and has made significant changes to seek to improve its human rights due diligence and commitments, but recent major corporate loan deals show otherwise.

Here are five other recent cases in which ANZ has financed companies implicated in land grabbing and other serious human rights violations:

In October 2018, ANZ arranged and co-financed a $1.4 billion revolving credit facility for AngloGold Ashanti, a South African gold mining company that colluded with security forces to violently and unlawfully seize land from hundreds of artisanal mining families in the West African country of Guinea to make way for an open-pit gold mine. Inclusive Development International supported the families - who have been deprived of their access to water, health care, education and livelihoods at a woefully inadequate resettlement site – to file a complaint against AngloGold Ashanti with the IFC’s Compliance Advisor Ombudsman in 2017.
In June 2018, ANZ co-financed a $500 million revolving credit facility to Itochu, a Japanese trading company that sources commodities from numerous companies involved in illegal land grabs, human rights abuses and deforestation in the pulp and paper, timber, palm oil and natural rubber industries.
In March 2018, ANZ arranged and co-financed $500 million revolving credit facility for Olam, a Singaporean food and agriculture company whose palm oil and rubber plantations in Gabon are allegedto have resulted in land grabs and destruction of rivers and primary rainforests.
In March 2018, ANZ arranged and co-financed a $7.3 billion revolving credit facility for the notorious Swiss mining giant Glencore, which has been accused of corruption and widespread environmental destruction and human rights abuses, including profiting from child labor and complicity in the killings of indigenous community activists and protesters in numerous countries where it operates in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
In September 2017, ANZ arranged and co-financed a $250 million revolving credit facility for Astra Agro Lestari, an Indonesian palm oil company described by Friends of the Earth at one of the industry’s “most irresponsible actors,” and which has allegedly grabbed indigenous land and threatened endangered species.

","New briefing paper on RWE – Europe’s worst polluter – for investors, insurers and banks",BNP Paribas ,France,Hambach open-cast mine ,mining - coal ,Germany,"
Along with our partners in the Europe Beyond Coal campaign, BankTrack has contributed to a new briefing paper on RWE, Europe’s biggest CO2 emitter. The briefing paper presents analysis and recommendations to assist investors, insurers and banks in achieving a coal phase-out from RWE.
While the recent IPCC report urges major efforts to limit global warming to 1.5°C, RWE is nowhere near having a company strategy in place which is in line with a 1.5°C world – indeed the company intends to hold on to its coal and lignite business until mid-century. The briefing therefore makes the case for financiers and investors to either divest from RWE immediately, or put RWE on notice of divestment if it does not provide a socially just plan to become 1.5°C compliant.
The Norwegian investor Storebrand has recently observed that “RWE shares are poisoned by coal – sell them off.” This came in the wake of RWE’s crackdown this autumn on Hambach forest protectors in western Germany. As Germany prepares itself for an accelerated coal phase-out via its Coal Commission, RWE has been intent on destroying the ancient Hambach forest and several villages to allow further mine expansion, a debacle which has severely damaged RWE’s image across Germany and Europe more widely.
The new briefing gives an overview of RWE’s power mix and existing coal power fleet and its outlook, the risks facing these power assets, pathways for how the utility might re-align its coal plant fleet to the UN Paris Climate Agreement, as well as the actions already being taken by investors, insurers and banks.
Also identified are RWE’s top five bank supporters: Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse and Royal Bank of Scotland have collectively provided RWE with EUR 5.2 billion (loans and underwriting) since 2016. The Europe Beyond Coal campaign is calling on investors, insurers and banks to adopt ‘no coal policies’ in line with the ‘principles and approaches for impactful public coal policies’ which have been developed by the campaign.
Europe Beyond Coal is also calling on investors, insurers and banks to require RWE to:
● Commit to align its business model with the UN Paris Climate Agreement and, more concretely, to adopt a time-bound, climate science-based target built on a forward-looking climate scenario analysis.
● Publish a clearly articulated and detailed roadmap for the gradual closure (not sale) of its existing coal plants, ending at the latest in 2030, which incorporates just transition plans for affected communities and workers.
● Put an immediate end to capital expenditure into new coal plants and mines and any form of lifetime extension for existing coal plants.
● Commit to preserving the ancient Hambach forest and villages threatened by its Garzweiler mine.

Paris, France ",912 activists ‘clean up’ Société Générale despite police repression,Société Générale ,France,Rio Grande LNG Terminal ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,United States,"
Responding to the call of Friends of the Earth France and Nonviolent Action COP21, 912 activists converged from all over France to participate in a large 'clean up' action of the main branch of Société Générale on the final day of COP24 in Poland. Despite violent police repression and the arrest of a demonstrator, the activists were determined that their call on Société Générale to end its support for fossil fuels and primarily shale gas be heard by the bank, and announced that they would clean up the bank's 150 Parisian branches throughout the day.
912 people gathered in front of Société Générale’s main branch on boulevard Haussmann in Paris. Equipped with brooms, sponges, mops and buckets, they were determined to carry out a giant, non-violent 'clean up' operation of the champion dirty energy bank. Large numbers of security services present at the scene violently repressed the attempts at cleaning by pushing, dispersing and gasing the activists. Gabriel Mazzolini, of Friends of the Earth France and in charge of dialogue with the police to ensure the smooth running of the action, was arrested.
Lorette Philippot, of Friends of the Earth France, commented:
“The mask falls. As COP24 concludes, the French government which claims to be a climate leader on the international scene, is gasing and stopping non-violent activists intent on denouncing Société Générale's responsibility for climate change. The image this presents internationally is highly unfortunate, that of a government which instead of taking the necessary measures to fight against climate change, prefers to violently repress this mobilisation of citizens. Our determination is redoubled, and we will clean up Société Générale’s 150 branches in Paris for the rest of the day.”
Jon Palais, from the organisation Nonviolent Action COP21, explained the reasons for this extraordinary mobilisation:
“The state of emergency in climate and social terms requires a response from major economic and financial actors, and Société Générale is at the top of this list. It massively finances climate change via the support which it continually grants to the fossil fuel sectors which are the most destructive for the planet. The success of this mobilisation shows the determination of citizens to fight against a profit policy which completely ignores the common good.” 
In front of activists shouting slogans such as “SoGé: we want to clean” and “The police, with us, we’re doing it for your children”, several speakers including Jason Opeña Disterhoft, from US organisation Rainforest Action Network, pointed out Société Générale’s responsibility for the development of shale gas.
Société Générale is the world’s top bank for financing the export of North American shale gas, with $1.1 billion in financing provided in 2017 to liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal projects in North America. 
Lorette Philippot concluded:
“Société Générale will have to choose its side, either that of the climate or that of politicians like Donald Trump who are blocking efforts to fight against climate change. The COP24 ending today in Poland has been badly overshadowed by US opposition to the recognition from the 196 parties of the conclusions of the latest IPCC report. It is precisely this irresponsibility from which we are asking Société Générale to dissociate itself.” 
The activists are calling on Société Générale to put an end to its support for shale gas, in particular the Rio Grande LNG project.  They have also demanded the immediate release of the arrested activist.
Photos of the action in Paris are available here.
Notes for editors:
1. See Société Générale fossil fuel financing statistics at:
www.ran.org/bankingonclimatechange2018 
2. These projects are a key component of the US administration’s ‘energy dominance’ policy, which aims to channel its overproduction of shale gas around the world, including to Europe and France – where fracking has been banned since 2011.
3. Rio Grande LNG, located in the south of Texas, is one of numerous projects supported by Société Générale. The bank is currently in charge of helping the company to structure the project and to convene other financiers, a crucial role that will bring about the raising of the $20 billion needed for the construction of the huge gas complex. 
The project would contribute emissions of the same scale as 44 coal-fired power plants and threaten the living conditions of local communities and indigenous peoples. Due to this carbon footprint of LNG from shale gas, French bank BNP Paribas decided in October 2017 to withdraw all its support to the sector.

Madrid, Spain ","Santander move on coal finance welcome but ‘far from enough’ to address its climate impacts, say groups",Banco Santander ,Spain,Punta Catalina-Hatillo coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Dominican Republic,"
Following a recent update to its coal finance policies, Spain’s biggest bank Banco Santander has committed to ending its direct financing of coal projects (mining and power) worldwide, a decision welcomed as a good move by NGOs.  Santander’s new commitment comes just a few weeks after the release of a video pushing banks including Santander to end their coal financing. 
The policy changes make Santander the twenty-first major international bank to commit to end project finance for new thermal coal mines, and the nineteenth to do the same for new coal plants worldwide. 
However the new commitment does not compel Santander to stop financing coal power companies, and will not see the bank cut its ties with companies such as PGE, Poland’s biggest utility and one of Europe’s top polluters. In September this year, Santander was one of a group of banks which provided PGE with a 950 million euro syndicated loan to support the company’s coal plant development plans. 
Reacting to Santander’s new coal finance commitment, Yann Louvel, Climate campaigner at BankTrack, said:
“This is a welcome and long overdue decision from Banco Santander. It will see it no longer directly financing corrupt, highly embarrassing dodgy coal deals such as the Punta Catalina project in Dominican Republic, which Santander financed in December 2015 right after COP21 in Paris. 
“Santander’s lack of ambition, though, at a time when banks need to really step up and reduce their exposure to fossil fuels in big, new ways to tackle climate change as demanded by the ‘Fossil Banks, No Thanks!’ campaign, is disappointing. By failing to exclude any of its coal clients from future support, Santander is still nowhere near moving beyond coal.” 
Santander’s progress on ending its direct financing of coal projects is insufficient as more than 90% of coal financial flows take place via indirect financing to coal companies. 
The bank’s new guidelines contain no immediate exclusion criteria for its existing coal customers which would tackle its financial assault on the climate. To date, several European banks have adopted such criteria, blacklisting significant coal producers and coal utilities. 
Carlota Ruiz-Bautista, environmental lawyer at Instituto Internacional de Derecho y Medioambiente (IIDMA), said:
“We welcome Banco Santander's tightening of its climate policies, a positive step towards limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees. However, it needs to deal as soon as possible with the loopholes in these policies to ensure it moves its capital fully away from carbon intensive economic sectors. This means adopting commitments to cease financing the coal sector as a whole, including all companies such as PGE listed in the Global Coal Exit List.”
As BankTrack and partners revealed last week in a new research report, over the past three years Santander has provided more than US$1.6 billion in financing for six major companies actively developing new coal plants around the world. The bank has done this via general corporate financing, which will not be affected by the new policies.

Katowice, Poland ",COP24: New research reveals the banks and investors financing the expansion of the global coal plant fleet,Bank of  ,China,,,,"
While the latest IPCC and UN Emissions Gap reports both issue stark warnings on the need for an accelerated phase-out of coal power, the global coal plant fleet is still expanding. At today’s press conference during the UN Climate Summit in Katowice, Urgewald, BankTrack and 26 NGO partners released new research identifying the banks and investors backing a frightening pipeline of new coal projects.

 

“In the 3 years since the Paris Climate Agreement was signed, coal-fired capacity has grown by over 92,000 MW, and coal plants totaling over 670,000 MW are still in the pipeline,” warns Heffa Schuecking, director of the German NGO Urgewald.

 

According to the NGOs’ data, the finance industry invested over US$ 478 billion in the world’s top 120 coal plant developers between January 2016 and September 2018.

 

“Unless banks and investors rapidly cut off their financial flows to coal plant developers, it will be impossible to come to grips with the climate crisis. We are already close to overshooting the 1.5°C limit and time is running out,” says Greig Aitken, Climate campaigner at BankTrack. 

 

Urgewald and BankTrack’s research examined lending, underwriting and institutional investments in the top 120 coal plant developers, which are responsible for over 68% of new coal-fired capacity in the pipeline.  All research results, including specific company, bank or investor results, are available at: www.coalexit.org/finance-data
See also BankTrack's short bank-focused breakdown of the new research’s key findings along with supporting analysis.

Key results: 

 
Lenders to the global coal plant pipeline

 

Since January 2016, 235 commercial banks provided over US$ 101 billion in direct loans to the 120 top coal plant developers. The largest lenders to coal plant developers are the Japanese banks Mizuho Financial and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial with US$ 12.8 billion and US$ 9.9 billion respectively.

 

A regional breakdown of the data covering the period 2016 to September 2018 shows that 30% of lending to top coal plant developers was provided by Japanese banks. The prominent role of Japanese banks is easily explained, according to Kimiko Hirata from the Japanese NGO Kiko Network: “Japan has the largest coal plant pipeline of any developed country and many Japanese companies are also champions of coal plant development overseas. Japanese banks are thus key drivers of coal expansion worldwide.”

 
Heffa Schuecking says: “What is surprising is that European banks, many of which have adopted policies restricting coal, still account for 25% of global lending to top coal plant developers.”

 

Among the top 10 lenders to coal plant developers are Citigroup from the United States (US$ 3.4 bn) and the European banks HSBC (US$ 2.3 bn), Standard Chartered (US$ 2.2 bn) and ING (US$ 1.9 bn). 

 
Greig Aitken comments: “Although HSBC adopted a new coal policy in April this year, it has explicitly left the door open to the financing of new coal power plants in Vietnam, Indonesia and Bangladesh. The planned coal capacity additions in these three countries alone add up to over 103,000 MW, almost one sixth of the global coal plant pipeline. HSBC has to close this glaring loophole quickly if it’s to have any hope of contributing to global efforts to limit the effects of climate change.”

 

The new research reveals that the bulk of the lending to coal plant developers is in the form of corporate loans, and this type of lending is often not addressed by bank policies.

 

Standard Chartered, for example, adopted a new coal policy in September 2018, which says: “We will not directly finance any new coal power plant projects”. Although the UK-based bank did not sign off any direct project financing deals for coal plants in either 2017 or 2018, its corporate lending to top coal plant developers in China, Indonesia, Japan and the Philippines jumped from US$ 373 million in 2017 to US$ 1.18 billion in the first three quarters of 2018.

 

Even the Dutch bank ING, whose 2017 policy commits the bank to phase out all financing of coal power companies by 2025, has provided almost US$ 500 million to coal plant developers through loans and underwriting in 2018.

 

“These examples show that banks’ coal policies are still full of loopholes. If large banks do not shut the door on corporate loans and underwriting for coal plant developers soon, it will be impossible to achieve the Paris Climate Goals,” says Schuecking.

 
Top underwriters of the global coal plant pipeline

 

Although Chinese banks only account for 12% of direct lending to coal plant developers, they are giants when it comes to underwriting the share and bond issues of these companies. 

 

Since January 2016, 238 international banks have channeled over US$ 377 billion to coal plant developers through underwriting.  The world’s top underwriter of coal plant developers is the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China with US$ 24.5 billion, followed by the China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) with US$ 19 billion and the Bank of China with US$ 18.2 billion.

 

Overall, Chinese banks account for almost 73% of underwriting for coal plant developers. This figure reflects China’s dominant role in coal plant development. In addition to more than 259,000 MW of new capacity in China’s own coal plant pipeline, Chinese companies are also developing almost 60,000 MW of new coal power capacity abroad. And China’s state-controlled banks play a central role in raising capital for this glut of new coal power, both at home and abroad.

 

Several US, European and Japanese banks that are prominent lenders to coal plant developers are also important underwriters. Among these are Citigroup (US$ 6 billion), HSBC (US$ 5.2 billion) and Mizuho Financial (US$ 5.2 billion). Overall, European banks account for 7.5%, Japanese banks for 5.2% and US banks for 4.7% of financial flows to coal plant developers through underwriting.

 
Top institutional investors in the global coal plant pipeline

 

While banks play a central role in helping coal plant developers acquire capital through underwriting their share and bond issuances, the ultimate buyers of these securities are investors. For 2018, the NGOs’ research identified 1206 institutional investors with combined holdings of US$ 139 billion in the top 120 coal plant developers. 

 

The world’s largest investor in coal plant developers is the US-based investment giant BlackRock, which holds shares and bonds in value of US$ 11 billion in 56 coal plant developers. The world’s second-largest investor in coal plant developers is Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund, which holds investments of US$ 7.3 billion in 41 coal plant developers. Next in line are Malaysia’s Khazanah Nasional (US$ 6.7 billion), the US investment manager Vanguard (US$ 6.2 billion) and South Korea’s National Pension Service (US$ 4.5 billion).

 

“Many of the global investors and banks named in our research profess to be responsible climate actors. But while governments are debating the future of our planet’s climate in Katowice, the money flows from these investors are literally burning up our planet,” says Heffa Schuecking.

 

US based investors hold the largest stakes in coal plant developers. In total, US investors account for 35% of the institutional investments in coal plant developers. European investors account for 16% and Japanese investors account for 14%, while Chinese and Indian investors only account for respectively 6% and 7% of institutional investments in the bonds and shares of coal plant developers.

 
Looking forward 

 

The news is not all bad, however. Some institutional investors have begun to act.

 

In 2017 and 2018, three of the world’s largest insurance companies – AXA, Generali and Allianz – adopted policies banning top coal plant developers from their portfolios. And just a few days ago, Norway’s largest private asset manager, Storebrand, announced a complete exit from all coal investments by 2026.

 

“The finance industry as a whole must replicate these policies,” says Greig Aitken. “It is shameful that large banks and investors are still partners in crime to companies whose business plans are a blueprint for triggering catastrophic climate change.”
Notes for editors:

 

1. For a full list of coal plant developer companies, see: www.coalexit.org/database

 

2. Underwriting or investment banking refers to the process by which banks raise investment capital for companies by helping them market new shares or bonds. Banks usually purchase the newly issued bonds or shares and then re-sell them to other investors at a profit.

 

3. Among the institutional investors covered in this research are pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds, asset management companies, commercial banks and sovereign wealth funds. It is likely that the investments of these institutions in coal plant developers are, in fact, significantly higher than indicated. Financial databases’ coverage of bond holdings is often incomplete and many pension funds do not report their holdings.

Geneva ",Precipitous drop in cluster munitions investments shows impact of global ban ten years on,,,,,,"
The global ban on cluster munitions is having an extraordinary impact on limiting investments in these weapons, which indiscriminately kill and maim civilians, says the Worldwide Investments in Cluster Munitions report released today. Compared to the 2017 report, the global level of financial investment in cluster munitions dropped from US$ 31 billion to $9 billion - a reduction of more than 70 per cent, the report finds. This precipitous drop is due in part to the halt in production and delivery of the banned weapon by two major US based manufacturers, Textron and Orbital ATK. Both producers have made public statements to this effect, with Orbital ATK noting, ""Cluster Munitions have no place in the arsenal of modern armies"".
The Worldwide Investments in Cluster Munitions report produced by the Dutch organization PAX - now in its ninth edition - examines global producers of the banned weapon, investments in these companies by financial institutions and states, and actions taken by private business, civil society and governments to prohibit such investments.
Ten years after the international ban on cluster munitions was signed in Oslo, Norway, the Convention on Cluster Munitions has been overwhelmingly successful, the report finds.
Major findings in the 2018 report include:

Seven Cluster munitions producers identified globally in four countries, including three  newly included companies.
A major decrease in the number of financial institutions found to have invested in cluster munitions producers - 88 compared to 166 institutions identified in 2017 - only seven of which have headquarters in states that have joined the Convention on Cluster Munitions.
A massive decrease in the level of funding - from US$ 31 billion reported in 2017 to US$ 9 billion for 2018 - invested in cluster munitions producers.
A marked increase in the number of financial institutions explicitly excluding investments in cluster munitions producers - now at 110.
A significant rise in the number of states taking steps to prohibit investments in cluster munitions, from 38 to 46.

""These weapons were banned by the international community due to their indiscriminate nature and proven record of killing and injuring civilians. The dramatic drop in both the number of investors as well as the total amount invested compared to the previous report shows how institutions globally are rejecting cluster munitions production,” said Hector Guerra, Director of the Cluster Munition Coalition.  ""Still, we need to focus on the emergence of new producers as well as the continued investments in cluster munitions worldwide. On this important anniversary of the Convention, CMC campaigners around the world are rallying to raise awareness about the importance of ending all investments in cluster munitions producers.”
Convention on Cluster Munitions 
Cluster munitions are indiscriminate weapons that pose a serious threat to civilian populations during and long after an attack. Under the Convention on Cluster Munitions, production, use, stockpiling, and transfer of the weapon is prohibited. December 3, 2018 marks the tenth anniversary of the Convention on Cluster Munition signing in Oslo, Norway. To date, a total of 120 States have joined the Convention.
Cluster Munition Coalition (CMC)
The CMC is the voice of civil society in the diplomatic arena, pushing for changes in government policies and practices on addressing the suffering caused by cluster munitions. CMC members around the world work in a spirit of cooperation with their governments and other partners to ensure countries join the Convention on Cluster Munitions and live up to its letter and spirit.
The 2018 update of the report “Worldwide Investments in Cluster Munitions; a shared responsibility” was written and edited by Cluster Munition Coalition member, PAX (the Netherlands); research company Profundo and Omega Research Foundation provided input and data for the report.

Paris ",Principles must bring commitments,Access Bank ,Nigeria,,,,"
Banks endorsing the draft “Principles for Responsible Banking” (PRB) - launched today in Paris at the UNEP Finance Initiative Global Roundtable - should rapidly back this up by making concrete commitments that ensure the PRBs deliver on their ambition to bring real change in how banks conduct their business, according to BankTrack.
This requires at minimum that all PRB endorsing banks commit to immediately end all financial support for new fossil fuel projects and develop a phase-out plan for their existing fossil fuel portfolios. Banks must also be prepared to sever business relationships with all clients whose activities wreak havoc on the planet, people and communities, and drastically increase their current commitments on transparency and accountability.
The PRBs have already received the backing of 28 banks, ranging from ethical bank Triodos of the Netherlands to regional banks including Banco Pichincha of Ecuador and Golomt Bank of Mongolia, to global banking giants such as Société Générale, BNP Paribas, ING, Santander and even ICBC of China, the world's largest bank. 
Given this wide initial uptake, the PRBs have the potential to become a new global standard for banks wanting to ‘do it right’. BankTrack therefore welcomes the PRBs as a long overdue commitment from banks to fully align their business with society's needs, but it calls on both UNEP-FI and the bank signatories to now rapidly move from formulating ‘Principles’ to making specific, timed ‘Commitments’ to bring their finance into line with the global goals they reference.
Johan Frijns, BankTrack director, commented: “We appreciate that UNEP-FI has taken the initiative to develop the PRBs, urging banks to take up their specific responsibilities for meeting the Paris Agreement goals and the SDGs. We understand the scale of the challenge to develop principles that are applicable to a wide range of banks, from ‘beginners’ to banks further advanced in dealing with the societal impact of their business.
“But the current draft principles appear to be developed somewhere in a windowless basement with broken clocks: even a casual glance outside, with climate breakdown and other ecological catastrophes rapidly unfolding, and with so little time left to fix things, shows that more than lofty Principles, we need concrete and rapid commitments from all banks to abandon business sectors that contribute to climate breakdown and other ecological disasters.”
To reflect the need for concrete commitments, BankTrack calls on UNEP-FI to rename its new initiative ‘Commitments for Responsible Banks’ and focus the PRBs on making the concrete commitments required.

With regard to the first principle on alignment, for climate change, this requires a public acknowledgement from endorsing banks that their continued financing of the fossil fuel industry is incompatible with reaching the Paris Agreement goal of keeping average global temperature rise to no more than 1.5 degrees. This should be followed by a commitment from endorsing banks to immediately end financial support for all new fossil fuel projects, including exploration, extraction, transportation and power, and the development of robust plans for phasing out support for existing fossil fuel projects and companies. To align with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), it is important that a final version of the Principles explicitly references the obligation of all banks to respect human rights, starting with the full implementation of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human rights (UNGPs). Firm commitments are required to implement international standards through policy, due diligence and processes for effective remedy, and to recognise the rights of people to say ‘no’ to bank-financed projects that affect them, including the right of Indigenous Peoples to free, prior and informed consent (FPIC).


Regarding the second principle, impact, banks must look beyond climate change and assess the impacts of their financial services on all other planetary boundaries – including land conversion, nitrogen and phosphate use, ocean acidification and biodiversity loss – and set strategies, timetables and performance indicators to ensure lending respects these boundaries.


With regards to the third principle, to work responsibly with clients and customers, banks must not only focus on engagement with clients to encourage sustainable business practices but also squarely commit to be willing to sever ties with clients whose business activities are fundamentally incompatible with reaching the Paris goals and the SDGs. Banks must acknowledge that not every client can be persuaded to align its business activities with these goals, and that engagement without the threat of divestment is toothless.


As to Principle Four on stakeholder engagement, the process of drafting the principles so far has certainly not met ‘best practice’. UNEP-FI must ensure that the consultation process to follow from the launch of the draft principles guarantees meaningful engagement of all stakeholders and show they are prepared to make changes to this draft. Endorsing banks must illustrate their commitment to meaningful stakeholder consultation by developing explicit policies that provide stakeholders affected by bank-financed activities access to all relevant information and to decision makers within the bank.


As to governance and culture, the current principles seem to merely formulate management practices that should be standard operating practices for any bank. Endorsing banks should commit to deep introspection on how internal bank culture, and the drivers that shape it, may be at odds with society's needs, and take steps to address this.


On the final Principle, transparency and accountability, banks should not limit themselves to being transparent on how they implement these principles. Instead they should drastically increase transparency across their operations, including opening up details of the companies and projects they finance, beginning with high-risk sectors. And to be accountable to society, banks must be willing to open channels to speak directly to those that may be negatively affected by bank-financed activities, by acting urgently to meet their UNGP responsibilities to establish or participate in effective grievance mechanisms.

Paris, France ","New report: Three years after the Paris climate summit, French banks are financing more coal",BNP Paribas ,France,CEZ Group ,energy plants - coal | energy plants - nuclear | mining - coal ,Czech Republic,"
In a report published today, Friends of the Earth France has called on French banks to immediately review their coal policies and introduce exclusions for companies developing new projects in this sector. The NGO has criticised the weakness of the current commitments of BNP Paribas, Société Générale, Crédit Agricole and Natixis which, since 2016, have provided more than EUR 10 billion in financing to companies which are gambling against compliance with the Paris Agreement on climate change. This figure represents an increase of 52% in coal financing from the banks compared to the three years prior to COP21.


As global finance institutions gather this week in Paris with the stated goal of building a sustainable financial system, the new report ‘COP21 + 3, French banks still in coal’, published today by Friends of the Earth France, reveals that French banks are still supporting the construction of new coal-fired power stations by massively financing the companies which are promoting these projects. 


Global capacity for coal-fired electricity generation has increased by 92 gigawatts since the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015 and 1380 projects are still planned today worldwide. According to new financial data, BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole, Société Générale and Natixis have granted more than EUR 10 billion in financing since COP21 to the 120 companies most aggressively involved in the construction of new coal-fired power plants. This total is 52% more than the EUR 6.7 billion the banks provided in the three years prior to COP21. 


This is due to the sectoral policies of the banks which strictly exclude only project financing, yet at the same time have only very low criteria for corporate financing. BNP Paribas, which accounts for almost EUR 4 billion in loans and issues of shares and bonds to the 120 companies, has taken measures which are clearly insufficient to directly restrict its support to companies which are highly active in the sector or which plan to increase their coal capacity.

Lucie Pinson, advisor to Friends of the Earth France’s private finance campaign, commented:

“French banks are refusing to exclude a certain number of companies based on the argument that instead they will support them in their efforts to realise the energy transition. We say that this should only apply for companies which are really trying to transform themselves in order to align with the 1.5°C trajectory.

“Those companies which are determined to build coal projects, which respected scientific and political authorities have repeatedly described as being strictly incompatible with the Paris Agreement, must be immediately jettisoned by French banks. To refuse to do so is to be responsible for the development of the sector responsible for the highest CO2 emissions and signals the failure of the climate objectives adopted in 2015 by the international community.”


While project finance has historically accounted for less than 10% of financing for the coal sector, the share of corporate finance provided for the construction of new coal plants is expected to grow due to the huge reputational risks associated with coal. This is particularly the case in Europe, where 66 projects are still planned, while all efforts should be aimed at the closure before 2030 of the 275 coal power plants in operation. 

Lorette Philippot, leading the private finance campaign at Friends of the Earth France, said:


“With EUR 1.8 billion and EUR 1 billion respectively in financing for European developers of new coal plants since COP21, BNP Paribas and Société Générale are the third and tenth largest international banks supporting companies blocking Europe in its energy transition. Among their customers are the German company RWE and the Czech company CEZ, whose coal activities 500 kilometres from Paris or Katowice, where COP24 will take place, threaten our climate, our health and even whole villages with destruction.


“The recent IPCC report on the consequences of warming to 1.5°C has shown that we have to accelerate our exit from fossil fuels. It is criminal to continue to finance not only coal companies, but also companies involved in tar sands and shale gas, as Crédit Agricole and Société Générale also continue to do.”


Published a few days before Climate Finance Day and COP24 in Poland, the report calls on banks to review their policies: French banks must commit to align their activities with a 1.5°C trajectory, immediately exclude companies which are expanding their activities in the coal sector or which are heavily active in or exposed to coal, and condition their support to other companies based on the adoption by 2020 of a detailed plan for the closure of their coal infrastructure.

 
Key figures from the report:

More than 1380 coal-fired power plants are still planned worldwide, including 66 in Europe, which, if built, would increase overall installed capacity by more than 33%.
120 companies aggressively developing new coal plants account for 68% of the global pipeline of new coal-fired power plants and constitute the Coal Plant Developers List (CPDL).
Since COP21 and the adoption of their coal commitments, BNP Paribas, Société Générale, Crédit Agricole and Natixis have increased their financing to the 120 coal developers from EUR 6.7 billion between 2013 and 2015 to EUR 10.25 billion between 2016 and 2018.
BNP Paribas has recorded nearly EUR 4 billion in loans and issues of shares and bonds to these companies since COP21.
While Crédit Agricole mainly finances Asian companies, BNP Paribas and Société Générale finance European coal developers, with respectively EUR 1.8 billion and EUR 1 billion in financing.
BNP Paribas and Société Générale finance companies, such as Germany's RWE and Uniper or the Czech Republic’s CEZ, which are developing their mines and coal plants in Europe and which are openly blocking the continent’s exit from coal.

Oxfam France on Saturday published a report ‘French banks, fossils take the lead’ on French banks’ financing of all fossil fuel sectors (coal, oil and gas) and renewable energy.

Jakarta ",Explosive reports expose illegal logging and human rights abuses by forestry giant Korindo Group,Mizuho Financial Group ,Japan,,,,"
In-depth investigations into the Korean-Indonesian conglomerate Korindo Group have produced two reports documenting widespread evidence of illegality, environmental destruction and community rights violations across the company’s operations. Korindo’s expansion into Indonesia’s frontier forests has involved primary forest clearance, intentional burning, land grabbing and police harassment and arbitrary arrest of local people, says the damning report titled Perilous: Korindo, Land Grabbing and Banks, issued today by Rainforest Action Network (RAN), WALHI, TuK-Indonesia and Profundo. These abuses have resulted in Korindo supplying unsustainable and likely illegal timber for the construction of Tokyo 2020 Olympics venues, as outlined in a second, related report also released today, titled Broken Promises.
A group of Indonesian protesters, including WALHI North Maluku, gathered at Korindo’s Jakarta headquarters today, as well as the headquarters of Korindo’s principal bank Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI), to demand that Korindo stop destroying forests in North Maluku, leave community territories, and for BNI to stop financing the company.
In North Maluku, community landowners are fighting Korindo to retain control of their traditional lands and forests. Evidence and testimonies included in today’s report demonstrate Korindo has forcibly taken community lands without their consent, illegally used fire to clear land, planted oil palm without required permits, and criminalized communities who resist the company’s operations, including arbitrary arrest and violence.
“Korindo is abusing and exploiting North Maluku and the Indonesian people,” said Ismet Soelaiman, Director of WALHI North Maluku. “From stealing community lands, harassing small scale farmers, to destroying local biodiversity with the monoculture plantation system, ordinary people are paying the price. Right now, Korindo is trying to grab more community forests in North Maluku to sell the timber and plant oil palm. The communities are resisting but they need the help of government and police to stop aiding illegal operations, and instead protect the people, their farms and forests.”
Research into Korindo’s finances, corporate structure and offshore shell companies uncovered further instances of unethical and illegal practices, including misreporting loan arrangements and financial statements through its Singapore shell companies. The reports also highlight the culpability of banks and investors that finance and profit from Korindo’s illegal operations. Korindo’s financiers and business partners  – principally Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI), SMBC Group, Hyosung Corporation, Sumitomo Forestry and Oji Holdings – have all played a critical role in Korindo’s expansion.
“BNI has committed to be a pioneer in sustainable finance,” said Edi Sutrisno from TuK-Indonesia. “To truly implement this commitment, it must first stop bankrolling companies like Korindo, operating without adequate permits and stealing community land and forests. Financing Korindo is in clear contradiction with BNI’s own standards, and is counter to new financial sector regulations from Indonesia’s Financial Services Authority. BNI should tighten its policies, drop companies like Korindo, and be a sustainable bank for the needs of ordinary Indonesians instead of tycoons.”
Evidence contained in the report also confirms Korindo has been sourcing illegal and unsustainable timber for its mills, and supplying plywood from those mills for the construction of Tokyo 2020 Olympics venues. Photographic evidence, company supply chain data and trade export records show that Korindo plywood used for Olympics venue construction has likely included illegal timber from North Maluku as well as timber cleared from orangutan habitat in East Kalimantan, supplied via the Japanese trading company Sumitomo Forestry.
“The Tokyo 2020 Olympic organizers promised to deliver a sustainable Olympics,” said Hana Heineken from RAN. “Instead, it has used over 110,000 sheets of tropical plywood from Indonesia that is linked to rainforest destruction, land-grabbing and clearance of endangered orangutan habitat, much of it to make way for oil palm plantations. The Olympics is supposed to celebrate human achievement and global solidarity, not be built on top of human rights violations and environmental destruction from remote corners of the world.”
The findings contained in these reports demand urgent and robust action, including investigations by the relevant Indonesian and Japanese authorities. The Tokyo 2020 Olympics and the Indonesian and Japanese banks and customers connected to these scandalous actions should immediately cut ties with Korindo.
This is not the first time Korindo has been implicated in reckless rainforest destruction and illegal burning.
The findings of this report were put to Korindo for their comment and response, between June and November 2018. Korindo insists that it operates in full accordance with all laws and regulations and that it is a leader in sustainability. Additional responses by Korindo and other named companies are contained in the reports.

",120 groups call on financiers to divest from all large scale forest biomass energy – it’s a dangerous ‘delusion’,,,,,,"
Over 120 groups from about 30 different countries have signed the position statement “The Biomass Delusion”, declaring the use of forest biomass for renewable energy to be a false solution for climate change mitigation. The broad NGO coalition, which includes organizations such as Greenpeace, NRDC, BankTrack and the Federation of Community Forest Users in Nepal, calls for an end to all finance, subsidies and policy support for large scale bioenergy.
“The Biomass Delusion” statement is released on the campaign day of the bioenergy industry promoting the burning of more wood, and just a couple of weeks after the release of the latest, hard hitting and sobering IPCC report on global warming of 1.5 degrees. The statement stresses that the large scale burning of forests to produce energy harms the climate, the forests, the people and the clean energy transition, and it highlights the importance of forests in the task of limiting the temperature increase.
Due to these strongly negative and adverse impacts, investing in biomass poses serious legislative, financial, reputational and climate risk to financiers.
Legislative Risk – The growing awareness about the negative impacts of burning biomass, including the fact that it emits more CO2eq than coal per unit of energy, will inevitably force lawmakers to abolish any forms of subsidies to this sector. Last August, the UK government already made a first step in this direction, implementing restrictions on subsidies for biomass. Without subsidies, the economic viability of these companies is questionable, and this is a risk for its financiers.
Climate Risk - Burning woody biomass actually contributes to climate change by increasing emissions and by destroying sinks. This will have a direct impact on the industry itself. Changes in the climate can affect water availability, which has direct impacts on the productivity of forests and plantations. Warmer weather also make plantations and forests more vulnerable to wildfires, which can lead to hundreds of thousands of hectares to go up in smoke, as has happened in recent years in Indonesia, Chile and Portugal. This causes serious financial losses, not to speak of the impacts on people’s lives, biodiversity and again, the climate.
Reputation Risk – The public will increasingly call out the industry and its financiers for their misleading messaging on biomass as a sustainable solution. Protests by affected communities, campaigners and scientists will increase, as this industry is destroying the most effective proven tool to extract carbon from the atmosphere: forests. The financiers of the sector can be perceived as being involved in greenwashing or even as causing direct harm to the climate.
Financial Risk –The increasing public protests against the burning of woody biomass will lower the demand for this form of energy, and thus the financial returns. In addition, legislative changes will reduce the subsidies allocated to the biomass sector and combined this will significantly impact the profitability of the sector.
“Forest biomass is a lose, lose, lose, lose proposition that has prompted this strong statement of concern from such multitude of groups. We appeal to policy makers, financiers, the markets and consumers to abandon support for large scale energy production from the forests.” said Peg Putt, the working group coordinator of the Environmental Paper Network which has organised the statement.

Amsterdam ",Dutch banks allow consumers to unwittingly invest in controversial palm oil companies,ABN AMRO ,Netherlands,,,,"
Private investors have been unknowingly and unwittingly investing in deforestation for years. By investing in funds offered by ABN AMRO, ING and Rabobank, they are filling the coffers of controversial palm oil companies, without being informed about it by their bank. In total the three banks offer 158 funds that include shares in palm oil companies. This was revealed by new research by SOMO, commissioned by Milieudefensie.  
Download the report here.
ABN AMRO offers 56 funds that include palm oil companies, Rabobank 61 and ING is the frontrunner with 85 funds. The funds include dozens of palm oil companies. Some of the funds have even received the 'sustainable' label. The funds include companies that are far from satisfying the sustainability policy for palm oil that the banks adopt.
Milieudefensie is shocked by the results. Rolf Schipper, campaign leader Forests: ""The fine words large banks utter about sustainability appear to be worthless in practice. Profit appears to be the sole criterion. It is downright scandalous that ING, ABN AMRO and Rabobank present the worst offending palm oil companies, to whom they don't even dare lend any money, as attractive share packages to unsuspecting Dutch investors.  As a result, these customers are unwitting accomplices in land grabbing and the devastation of the last remaining rainforest.""
Milieudefensie wants the government to restrict this proliferation of sustainable claims and controversial investments. Schipper: ""The government, together with the EU can use binding regulations to make it compulsory for banks to be transparent about the sustainability of loans and investments. Ultimately there needs to be legislation to regulate that our money can only be invested in businesses and projects that contribute to a better world for man, animals and the environment.""
Earlier this month, Aegon Nederland decided to withdraw its money from the palm oil industry. Milieudefensie calls on the banks to follow this example and cut all ties with the palm oil sector. Palm oil producers devastate the rainforest on a large scale and wipe out flora and fauna. The multinationals drive the local population off their own land. Milieudefensie recently visited the village of Pungkat in Indonesia, where a palm oil company razed the rainforest to the ground, and robbed the local population of their drinking water, farmland and sources of income. The palm oil company PT SAL has close ties with First Resources, one of the companies included in the funds, which are offered by all three major banks.
Via www.trekdegrens.nl Dutch people have already sent 60,000 postcards to the banks to call on them to withdraw from the palm oil industry.

Washington, D.C. ","Indigenous, environmental and climate justice groups rally outside Equator Principles meeting",,,Dakota Access Pipeline ,energy distribution | oil and gas,United States,"
Updated with pictures and livestreamed footage from the rally.
What: This week in Washington, major global banks are meeting to revise the Equator Principles, industry-led due diligence standards that should prevent banks from supporting environmentally and socially harmful projects. At the same time, some of those same banks are re-upping their support for Enbridge, the Canadian company behind the Line 3 tar sands pipeline, which violates Indigenous rights and is flatly incompatible with the goals of the Paris climate agreement. Banks renewing their support for Enbridge comes on the heels of the publication of a landmark U.N. report showing the desperate urgency of taking concrete steps to tackle the climate crisis.

Speakers will include:
Wasté Win Yellowlodge Young (Ihunktowanna/Hunkpapa of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, Former Tribal Historic Preservation Officer)


Jessica Parfait (United Houma Nation, Graduate student at Louisiana State University exploring impacts of oil and gas on Houma tribal communities)

Leoyla Cowboy (Diné, member of The Red Nation, and community organizer for the Water Protector Legal Collective)
Osprey Orielle Lake (Executive Director of WECAN and Co-Director of the Divest, Invest, Protect campaign).

Further Background: Major banks from the US and around the world called for a “do over” and a “second chance” after funding Energy Transfer Partners’ (ETP) Dakota Access Pipeline without the consent of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. After the human rights abuses at Standing Rock, banks said they would reform the Equator Principles.

 

The Equator Principles Association is bringing together over 90 international banks in Washington DC, Oct 16-18, who have signed on to adhere to a voluntary set of standards for financial institutions to assess social and environmental risk. These standards are intended to provide a minimum standard for due diligence and monitoring to support responsible risk decision making. Had these standards been stronger, banks would have not financed the Dakota Access Pipeline.

 

Banks are involved in a revision process until 2019 that could more effectively address concerns about potential rights violations and environmental degradation. Before 2019, critical projects - including ETP’s Bayou Bridge Pipeline, Enbridge’s Line 3 and TransCanada’s Keystone XL -- still receive support from Equator Principle banks. Banks must be held accountable for the funds they provide to their clients and their contributions to Indigenous rights abuses and climate chaos.

 

Banks were presented with an open letter in advance of the meeting, signed by 45 civil society organisations, calling on them to ensure the new version of the Equator Principles delivers strong commitments on Indigenous rights, combatting the climate crisis, full transparency and accountability. The revision process was announced at last year’s annual meeting of the Equator Principles Association after a campaign supported by over 100,000 people and almost 250 civil society groups called on the Equator banks to act to stop financing climate disasters and respect Indigenous People's rights and territories.

Statements from organizers:

 

“We keep finding ourselves campaigning against the very same environmentally destructive projects that violate Indigenous rights, yet this is exactly what the Equator Principles is supposed to safeguard against.” said Ruth Breech, Senior Climate and Energy Organizer at Rainforest Action Network. “What we need is real action for a historic redirection of capital away from fossil fuels and towards the economy of the future that protects Indigenous rights of Free, Prior and Informed Consent.”

 

""Dirty tar sands pipelines like Line 3 would be disastrous for our communities and our climate, and any bank that’s helping fund the companies behind these projects are complicit in the damage they cause,"" said Kelly Martin, Director of the Sierra Club’s Beyond Dirty Fuels Campaign. ""If these banks are actually committed to addressing human rights violations and the threat of climate change, they must immediately stop supporting these dangerous projects.""

 

""We are calling for action and accountability from the institutions enabling fossil fuel extraction to devastate the Earth and communities worldwide,” said Osprey Orielle Lake, Executive Director of the Women's Earth and Climate Action Network (WECAN) International and Co-Director of the Divest, Invest, Protect Campaign. “In a time of unprecedented and accelerating climate chaos - business as usual simply cannot continue. Indigenous peoples and Indigenous women in particular continue to experience the worst of the abuses, rights violations, and impacts of extractive industries - and despite this, are showing up with brilliant solutions, demands, and strategies to envision a just and healthy world. It is time for the Equator Principles Association to heed the calls of Indigenous peoples, and take immediate action to respect and uphold their rights and align themselves with the facts of climate change.""

 
Johan Frijns, Director of BankTrack, said: “Equator banks at today’s meeting must realise they are at a crossroads. They either choose to approach this revision process with real ambition to deliver Equator Principles that are strong enough to ensure banks meeting the formidable social and environmental challenges of our times, or they choose a path in which this set of standards becomes obsolete and delivers neither for the environment and human rights nor as an effective risk management tool.”

Nijmegen ","‘Fossil Banks, No Thanks!’: 120 civil society groups call on banks to end fossil fuel finance",,,,,,"
A new international campaign calls on large commercial banks to immediately end their support for all new fossil fuel projects, and to publish robust phase-out plans for their existing fossil fuel clients, at the latest before the 25th UN Climate Summit in November 2019.

The ‘Fossil Banks, No Thanks!’ campaign was launched today by BankTrack, together with campaigning groups including urgewald, Friends of the Earth France, Oil Change International, Rainforest Action Network, and the Sierra Club. The ‘Global Call on Banks’ in support of the campaign has already received the support of 120 civil society organisations from 34 countries. 

The campaign primarily targets 38 major banks. Between 2015 and 2017, these banks – including HSBC, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, JPMorgan Chase, MUFG and Santander – were involved in financing of at least USD 345 billion for projects and companies in the coal, oil and gas sectors.  

All of these banks continue to support projects and clients in the coal, oil and gas sectors, with only a few having recently introduced exclusion criteria for specific types of coal power plants, coal mines, or high-impact oil sources such as tar sands and Arctic drilling.

While many banks recognise the urgency of combating climate change, less than a quarter of the banks targeted by the campaign explicitly acknowledge that the burning of fossil fuels is the main driver of climate change. None recognise that preventing climate breakdown requires a rapid phase out of fossil fuel use, and that financing new fossil fuel extraction is incompatible with this goal. 

All 38 banks were notified today in an open letter that civil society demands public clarity, before the next UN climate summit in Poland in December 2018, on their view of the relation between climate change and the extraction and burning of fossil fuels, followed by concrete action to end their fossil fuel financing. 

The ‘Fossil Banks, No Thanks!’ campaign was launched after several months of extreme weather events, with temperature records being broken across the globe, and a week after a new report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that rapid and unprecedented action is needed from state and non-state actors to keep the average global temperature rise below the 1.5 degrees Celsius target of the Paris Agreement. 

The ‘Fossil Banks, No Thanks!’ campaign seeks to mobilise the public in demanding from their banks that they take decisive action on their fossil fuel financing. Organisations and members of the public can sign the Global Call on Banks at www.fossilbanks.org.

Johan Frijns, BankTrack's director, commenting on the ‘Fossil Banks, No Thanks!’ campaign launch, said: “Climate change, long perceived as a distant threat, is now fully upon us, and only rapid and decisive action will prevent further climate breakdown. We want to know from banks whether they are with us in preventing this breakdown, or plan to further finance it. There is no more time for banks to make small incremental changes to their energy policies. Bold decisions on their fossil fuel phase out are required.

We know that there is no one-size-fits-all exit strategy for all banks. How each bank will wind down their financing will depend on their fossil fuel portfolios. But there is no excuse for any of them to put further capital towards new coal, oil or gas projects. The world’s remaining carbon budget to stay below the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit won’t allow it.”

Kelly Martin, Director of the Sierra Club’s Beyond Dirty Fuels Campaign, said: “The tide is turning against investments in fossil fuel infrastructure, and the international movement calling for divestment from these dirty, dangerous projects isn’t going away. Any bank that's still supporting fossil fuels is stuck in the past. It's time for them to commit to investing in a future that benefits our communities, our economies, our health, and our planet.”

Paddy McCully, Director of Rainforest Action Network’s Climate and Energy Program, said:“The shocking conclusions of the latest UN IPCC report shows it is long past time for banks to give up their waffling and dissembling on climate change. Bankers need to stop financing the expansion of fossil fuels and commit to phasing out dirty energy on a schedule that's aligned with climate science. Banks can no longer profess concern for climate change while simultaneously pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into the companies that are mainly responsible for it.”

Regine Richter, Energy campaigner with environmental and human rights organisation urgewald, said: “We have seen some small steps by banks on coal, which we welcome. But in the light of the climate change emergency they are simply too small and much more needs to happen from the banks.”

Lorette Philippot, Private Finance Campaigner at Friends of the Earth France, said: “A week ago, the science community taught us that avoiding disastrous levels of global warming calls for ‘rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society’. Banks such as Société Générale, with its massive support for the development of new fracked gas export terminals in the U.S. and to the Rio Grande LNG project in particular, are fuelling the fossil industry and need to immediately take action consistent with the scale of the emergency, or they will be held accountable for a world beyond 1.5°C, just as much as the dirty companies and projects they are continuously backing.”

Claire Hamlett, coordinating the Fossil Banks, No Thanks! campaign at BankTrack, said: “We launch this campaign today with the support of 120 organisations from around the world. This goes to show how civil society groups, with diverse demands and campaign targets, are converging on the goal of getting bank finance out of fossil fuels and into clean energy. The months to come will see many more civil society groups joining this campaign, ensuring that our demands will not be ignored.”

",ANZ bank issued rare rebuke by Australian oversight body,ANZ ,Australia,,,,"
ANZ Banking Group violated its own policies and international human rights standards by financing a Cambodian sugar company that seized land from local farmers, according to a statement released today by an Australian government body that monitors corporate behavior overseas. In a rare rebuke of a commercial bank, the Australian National Contact Point found it “difficult to reconcile” ANZ’s decision to finance Phnom Penh Sugar with the bank’s internal rules and the OECD Guidelines, an ethical business code that the Australian government has endorsed.
In 2011, ANZ provided a $40 million loan to Phnom Penh Sugar, which had forcibly displaced hundreds of local farming families and employed school-aged children in dangerous conditions at its sugarcane plantation in southern Cambodia. The human rights risks of doing business with the sugar company “would likely have been readily apparent” to ANZ, according to the findings. English-language media had regularly reported on the company’s role in land seizures and forced evictions prior to the loan.
The Australian National Contact Point, established as part of the country’s membership in the OECD, receives complaints against Australian corporations operating overseas. Equitable Cambodia and Inclusive Development International, which filed the complaint on behalf of 681 affected families, welcomed the decision, which was nearly four years in the making, but noted that it fell short of explicitly calling on the bank to provide concrete remedies for the harms it contributed to.
“This decision makes clear what should have been obvious to ANZ at the time: it should not have financed a company that was involved in a land conflict with thousands of local farmers,” said Eang Vuthy, Executive Director of Equitable Cambodia. “While this offers some measure of vindication for the families, it doesn’t address their immediate situation, which remains desperate.”
Nearly a decade after being forcibly displaced, most of the families have received little to no compensation for their losses, including their homes and land and years of missed crops and income. With few viable options, some have accepted grueling, hazardous employment in the sugar plantations where their rice fields once stood. Nearly all are worse off than before being displaced.
The affected families are calling on ANZ to divest the profit from the loan and grant it to the families to help them restore their livelihoods. This is in line with guidance issued by the OECD that calls for financiers of projects that contribute to human rights violations to contribute to a remedy.
“ANZ, a bank that touts its human rights standards and has made billions of dollars in Asia, should now publicly accept its share of responsibility for the harms caused to Cambodian farmers and provide commensurate compensation to the victims,” said Natalie Bugalski, Legal Director at Inclusive Development International.
In the years after ANZ provided the loan, Phnom Penh Sugar continued to harm local people, including through further seizures of private farmland and crops, clear-cutting of protected community forests, and the widespread use of child labor on its plantations. ANZ contends that it exited its financing relationship with Phnom Penh Sugar in 2014 after unsuccessful attempts to encourage the company to address the situation.
The reality is quite different, the families and their advocates say.
“We did not see ANZ take sufficient action to convince its client, over which it had financial leverage, to make things right. When public pressure on the bank increased, ANZ simply announced that it had exited its relationship with Phnom Penh Sugar, rather than standing by its own corporate standards,” Bugalski said. “This decision to cut and run does not absolve ANZ of its responsibility to contribute to remediation of the suffering from which it profited.”
Joseph Wilde-Ramsing, Coordinator of OECD Watch, an international corporate accountability network, said: “According to the OECD Guidelines, when a bank contributes to an abuse, it is also responsible for contributing to the remedy. Here we have what appears to be a cut and dry case of an Australian bank contributing to harms of a vulnerable community in Cambodia, and ignoring its responsibilities under the Guidelines.”
Inclusive Development International and Equitable Cambodia filed the complaint in October 2014. The body acknowledged that the process took an “unacceptably long time” and promised future improvements in performance.
The Australian National Contact Point concluded its statement by calling on the bank to strengthen its due diligence systems and instigate “methods to promote and demonstrate internal compliance with its own stated corporate standards with respect to human rights….” It also recommended that ANZ establish a grievance resolution mechanism “as a way of demonstrating that its actions are consistent with community expectations around the accountability of multinational enterprises in this area.” ANZ was requested to report back to the Australian National Contact Point on its actions in response to each of these recommendations in 12 months.
“This case really highlights the weak state of corporate accountability in Australia,” said Keren Adams, Director of Legal Advocacy at the Human Rights Law Center. “We welcome the fact that the National Contact Point has called out ANZ’s reckless behavior for what it is and called upon the bank to improve its human rights due diligence processes moving forward, but this is ultimately just a slap on the wrist. If the National Contact Point is serious about improving corporate accountability, it must go much further when it finds violations, including by calling for adequate redress for harm caused.”
Last year, the Australian government commissioned an independent review which found that the Australian office “ranked among the poorest performing National Contact Points internationally” and recommended sweeping changes to improve the way it handles complaints. A year later, the government has yet to respond to the recommendations.
The complaint is available here.

",Major banks are failing Vietnam by violating Equator Principles commitments in financing coal power projects,DBS ,Singapore,Nam Dinh coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Vietnam,"
Market Forces, working with Vietnamese community organisations and other international NGOs, has found that Equator Principles signatory banks are violating those principles in their involvement in syndicates funding five Vietnamese coal-fired power stations. In doing so, they are failing the people that the principles seek to protect.
The six Equator banks cited by the new report are:  DZ Bank, HSBC, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Mizuho Financial Group (Mizuho), Standard Chartered and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC).
The Equator Principles (EPs) are a global set of voluntary standards that financial institutions sign on to – so that in financing large scale projects, they don’t do harm to people and the environment. 
The EP violations identified in the report include: 

Failure to ensure that the project sponsors disclose information key for communities to evaluate the impacts of proposed power stations, whether through Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs) or other means.
Failure to require compliance with Vietnamese Law on Environmental Protection.
Failure to ensure that the sponsors explore alternatives to the projects or by conducting alternatives analyses themselves.

All 94 Equator Principles financial institutions are meeting on 16 October 2018 to review the EPs and make some much needed and long overdue changes.
These principles are far from perfect in their current form. But, if they are to protect the people most affected by the Vietnamese coal-fired power projects, the banks that have signed up to them must be held accountable.
The other 88 financial institutions have a responsibility to ensure not only that they follow the EPs themselves, but also that their fellow signatories do so.
Australia’s big four banks – ANZ, Commbank, NAB and Westpac – are all EP members.
Market Forces is calling on the big four and all other banks to ask them to pull their fellow banks into line, or risk the integrity of the Equator Principles altogether.

San Francisco, USA ","JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Crédit Agricole warned not to finance tar sands pipeline companies ",Crédit Agricole ,France,Line 3 Pipeline Replacement Project (L3RP) ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,United States,"
Today, on Indigenous People’s Day, Honor The Earth, Rainforest Action Network, Sierra Club, 350 Seattle, Friends of the Earth France and others launched a campaign calling on JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and French bank Crédit Agricole to end their participation in credit lines of nearly $4 billion dollars associated with Indigenous rights violations with major tar sands pipeline companies Enbridge and TransCanada. The broad coalition of Indigenous and environmental groups kicked off the campaign by delivering an open letter to the banks. This presents an escalation in national efforts to hold banks accountable for environmental and human rights impacts stemming from the funding of major fossil fuel infrastructure projects.
The warning letter urges banks to avoid the reputational and financial risk of supporting Enbridge, the company behind the controversial Line 3 pipeline, which is incompatible with achieving the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement and respecting human rights, especially those detailed in the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.
As with the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) — a highly controversial project constructed without the Free, Prior, and Informed Consent of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe — both the Line 3 and Keystone XL pipelines pose a grave threat to Indigenous rights. Neither Enbridge nor TransCanada has secured the Free, Prior and Informed Consent of all the tribes on the route of their projects. The Mille Lacs, White Earth, and Red Lake tribes in Minnesota, whose lands would be crossed by Line 3, are fighting the project in the courts, while Indigenous-led grassroots opposition is fighting Line 3 on the ground.
With $1.48b of Enbridge’s credit facilities set to expire on the same day that the Equator banks are meeting to discuss environmental and social risk management and revision of the Equator Principles, the coalition is urging the banks to heed the lessons learned from Energy Transfer Partners’ DAPL and Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain Pipeline and decline any renewed involvement.
Statements:
Tara Houska, National Campaigns Director at Honor The Earth said: “Enbridge has the only fully approved, fully funded major tar sands line in North America. It is a 1/3 owner in Dakota Access, and therefore a 1/3 owner in the UN-documented brutality on unarmed people that took place in Standing Rock. Enbridge now wants to slam almost one million barrels of tar sands per day through my people’s treaty territory and sacred wild rice, against the will of the tribes and people. No bank with even the most basic respect for human rights should be funding this company. Stop funding cultural genocide.”
Ruth Breech, Senior Climate and Energy Campaigner at Rainforest Action Network said: “Banks have a choice, and we’re telling JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Crédit Agricole loud and clear that they need to back off. Any bank that decides to renew credit with Enbridge and Transcanada will be implicated in Indigenous rights abuses and will knowingly add fuel to the fire of climate chaos. They won’t be able to claim that they didn’t have all the relevant information.”
Kelly Martin, Director of the Sierra Club’s Beyond Dirty Fuels Campaign said: “Dirty tar sands pipelines like Keystone XL and Line 3 would be disastrous for our communities and our climate, and any bank that’s helping fund the companies behind these projects are complicit in the damage they cause. Wells Fargo and other banks must stop supporting these dangerous projects and instead commit to investing in a future that benefits our communities, our economies, our health, and our planet.”
Alec Connon, 350 Seattle's Fossil Fuel Financing Campaign Director said: “It's morally unacceptable to profit from the destruction of our planet and the abuse of Indigenous Peoples' sovereign rights ― and that's what banks like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo are doing when they fund the Line 3 and Keystone XL pipelines.”
Lorette Philippot, Private Finance Campaigner at Friends of the Earth France said: “As soon as next week, Crédit Agricole, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo will have two options: refusing to renew their credit lines to Enbridge and make their actions consistent with their own policies and discourses; or renewing these supports and once again internationally appear as banks trampling on human rights. We call on them to get on the right side of history.”

",Civil Society welcomes IFC’s moves to exclude coal in its financial intermediary lending,,,,,,"
Civil society groups from around the world today welcomed news that the World Bank’s private sector arm, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), has taken significant steps to vastly reduce its exposure to coal through new financial intermediary (FI) investments. The CEO of the IFC, Philippe Le Houérou, has committed to help FI clients to reduce or in some cases exit coal.  He states in a blog post published today that the IFC has eliminated general purpose loans to financial intermediaries and now ‘ring-fences’ about 95 percent of its lending to FIs to “ensure that the financing only supports targeted areas, such as projects promoting energy efficiency, renewables, women business owners, or small and medium-sized enterprises.”
“The IFC has a $57 billion portfolio and influence over another $4.5 trillion in investments in emerging markets. IFC is sending a strong signal that there is no future for coal,” said Kate Geary, Co-Director of Bank Information Center Europe.
“This is an important step by the IFC to redirect its investment to align with the Paris Agreement on climate change, and other financial institutions should sit up and pay attention. This move reflects the tireless efforts of frontline communities fighting destructive coal projects while feeling the impact of a changing climate. The IFC must now also ensure that it extends this new approach to be consistent with the World Bank Group’s broader commitment to end finance for oil and gas extraction, and lead a transition of all investments toward a safe climate future,” said Alex Doukas of the Big Shift campaign.
The IFC’s ‘hands-off’ lending through financial intermediaries has embroiled it in human rights and environmental scandals from Honduras to Cambodia. The IFC has been reforming its FI lending following public outcry, disastrous media coverage, damaging findings from its independent accountability mechanism, the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman (CAO) and pressure from a rattled Board.
In October last year, more than 100 civil society organisations and affected communities in the Philippines filed an historic complaint to the CAO – the first mass climate-related complaint ever filed against IFC – for investing in Rizal Commercial Banking Group, which went on to bankroll a boom in coal fired power plants across the country.
A key demand of  the complaint was that the IFC clean up its financial intermediary portfolio and ensure that its intermediaries hold to the same climate and energy commitments that the World Bank Group has made for its direct investments.
While the IFC’s announcement is a step in the right direction and demonstrates that it can act to exclude harmful projects from its portfolio, the commitments do not yet go far enough. Through what he calls “a green equity investment approach,” Le Houerou stated that the IFC would continue to take equity stakes in financial intermediaries that “formally commit upfront to reduce or, in some cases, exit all coal investments over a defined period.”
“If the IFC really wants to shift the market, it needs to make it clear to banks that if they want the IFC’s equity and seal of approval, they need to get out of the business of financing coal – full stop,” said David Pred, Executive Director of Inclusive Development International   “Without the blanket coal exclusion that we have been calling for, the IFC will need to require full disclosure by its clients of their exposure to coal and other environmentally and socially risky projects so that civil society can monitor the speed and extent to which these banks are actually getting greener.”
Civil society also urged the IFC to address the legacy impacts of its financial intermediary portfolio. “The IFC’s financial intermediary lending is inherently flawed, un-transparent and unaccountable. The IFC’s change of heart on coal has come too late for the communities affected by the GMR Kamalanga coal plant, who continue to suffer to this day. As part of its reforms, the IFC should put right past damages and ensure FI clients provide redress to affected communities,” said Joe Athialy, Director of Centre for Financial Accountability, India.
“The Philippine Movement for Climate Justice welcomes this IFC policy shift as a positive step towards achieving the climate goals. But with this bold announcement, we find no reason for the IFC’s continuous presence on the board of Rizal bank, which has not backed away from its coal investments even after drawing fire from affected communities. The IFC should atone for of the negative impacts of its past decisions, as a matter of social responsibility and justice,” said Bibiano Rivera, of the Philippines Movement for Climate Justice.
Civil society is now urging the IFC to make two complementary steps: to ensure greater transparency and to help its FI clients decarbonise their own portfolios.
The IFC must make its FI lending more transparent so that affected communities are able to hold the IFC accountable for its reforms. The IFC should:

Disclose the name, sector and location of sub-projects financed via FIs both on its own  website and that of  the FI client;
Publicise its involvement at the site of the project itself among affected communities;
Adhere to a wide range of transparent and consultative processes with communities and CSOs, to avoid backing such damaging projects in future
Track and disclose its FI clients’ exposure to coal and other fossil fuels.

In order to clean up its FI lending portfolio and achieve a transformational shift in global finance flows through its influence on clients and other financial actors, the IFC should:

Ensure that none of its investments result in an increase in coal support by IFC clients: whether for power generation or industrial uses, and associated facilities such as transmission lines and railways or ports primarily meant for the transportation of coal;
Exclude coal across all its FI investments and disclose these exclusion clauses, so that they can be publicly monitored; also exclude upstream oil and gas from 2019 in line with Word Bank Group’s commitments
Refuse to invest in FIs whose portfolios have more than a 5% exposure to coal. Dutch Bank ING has stated it will no longer finance utilities sector clients that will be over 5% reliant on coal in 2025 and will stop lending to its existing clients unless they end their reliance on coal by 2025. BNP Paribas will only provide services and investment to companies that are diversifying away from coal. The Dutch development finance institution FMO, which is a similar operator to the IFC and invests in similar markets, has a 20% portfolio coal exposure limit in place, demonstrating that this target-setting is possible.
Work with new and existing clients to ensure they disclose their GHG emissions and commit to develop a portfolio decarbonisation plan within a year of investment, which aims to achieve emissions reductions in line with targets set under the Paris Climate Agreement.

The IFC should also ensure that harms caused by existing coal projects supported via FI clients are remedied and that local communities receive adequate redress.

Berlin ","Over 670,000 MW of new coal threatens 1.5°C climate target",,,National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) ,energy plants - coal | energy plants - hydro  | energy plants - renewables | manufacturing | mining - coal ,India,"
Four days before the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) puts forward its special report on 1.5°C, NGOs have released a new list of the world’s top 120 coal plant developers.


“Building new coal plants is an assault on the Paris climate goals,” said Heffa Schücking, director of the German environment NGO Urgewald. “Our list names the top companies investors and banks need to shun if they are committed to limiting our planet’s temperature rise.”

 

While 2017 was another record-busting year for renewables, coal power is still growing in many parts of the world. Currently, 1,380 new coal plants or units are planned or under development in 59 countries. If built, these plants would add 672,124 MW to the global coal plant fleet – an increase of 33%. In order to prevent investments in this frightening pipeline of new coal projects, Urgewald and 28 NGO partners have today released the names and project details of the top 120 companies which account for 68% of the global coal plant pipeline. The full list can be accessed at www.coalexit.org/database.  

Key findings

 

The world’s largest coal plant developer is China’s National Energy Investment Group (NEI), which aims to build 37,837 MW of new coal plants. The National Energy Investment Group was formed last year, when the Chinese Government merged the Shenhua Group with the China Guodian Corporation. The number 2 and 3 worldwide are the China Huadian Corporation with 25,097 MW and India’s National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) with 25,056 MW of new coal capacity in the pipeline.


While these companies already operate huge coal plant fleets, 28% of the world’s top 120 coal plant developers have no installed coal capacity as of yet. Coal plant developers are a diverse group and also include companies like the Texhong Textiles Group, which is planning a 2,100 MW coal plant for its industrial park in Vietnam, or the Canadian copper miner First Quantum Minerals, which is building coal power stations in Panama and Botswana.

 

“Our analysis shows that in many countries coal mining interests are key drivers of coal power development,” says Schücking. Forty six of the top 120 coal plant developers are also coal producers and the main rationale for building coal plants in ‘frontier’ countries like Tanzania, Mozambique or Botswana is to power the development of coal mining.

 

Out of the 59 countries where new coal plants are planned, 11 countries have only 600 MW or less of installed coal capacity and 16 have no coal-fired capacity whatsoever.


“Two and a half years after the Paris Climate Agreement was signed, it is worrying that these projects are locking so many new countries into a cycle of coal dependency for decades to come,” commented Lidy Nacpil from the Asian Peoples’ Movement on Debt and Development.

 

The world’s top 120 coal plant developers are headquartered in 42 countries, but almost 1/5 of the companies on the list have their headquarters in China. While China is the largest producer of photovoltaic power and the world leader in wind power generation, its planned coal capacity additions of 259,624 MW account for over 1/3 of the global coal plant pipeline.


Chinese companies also play a key role in building new coal power plants abroad, and are currently developing 59,619 MW of new coal-fired capacity in 17 countries. Almost 19% of Chinese-led coal plant development is thus taking place outside of China. Japanese companies are, however, also champions of overseas coal plant development. All in all, Japanese companies account for 37,044 MW of new coal capacity, out of which 21,930 MW or 59% are planned overseas.

 

Bobby Peek from the South African NGO Groundwork said, “From Egypt to South Africa, virtually all of the new coal plants in the pipeline are encountering enormous resistance on the ground. It’s time for foreign investors and companies to stop pushing forward outdated energy projects in our countries. People want clean and renewable energy instead of filthy coal projects.”

 

The release of the Coal Plant Developers List is aimed at the finance industry. How many of the planned, announced or permitted new coal projects actually move forward, is almost always a question of financing.


“Our list provides banks and investors with the information they need to become responsible climate actors. Each and every coal plant that goes online puts a new stumbling block between us and the Paris goals,” said Schücking.


Over the past year, some of Europe’s largest investors like Allianz, AXA and Generali have adopted policies banning coal plant developers from their investment universe. And many of the world’s largest international banks and investors are now using Urgewald’s research.

 

While the coal plant pipeline has shrunken significantly since 2016, mainly due to new policies in China and the rapidly sinking costs of renewables in countries like India, the world’s coal plant fleet is still growing. Since the Paris Climate Agreement was negotiated in December 2015, the world’s installed coal-fired capacity grew by 92,000 MW – an increase equal to the combined operating coal fleets of Russia and Japan.


“Financial institutions need to react and adopt policies for a full coal exit,” commented Schücking.

Background on the Coal Plant Developers List 

 

The pipeline of new coal projects is very dynamic. Each year, new coal plant plans are announced, old plans are abandoned or in some cases the ownership of planned projects undergoes shifts. The first Coal Plant Developers List (CPDL) was developed by Urgewald in 2017 as a tool for banks and investors. In order to keep this tool sharp and effective, the CPDL is updated every year. This year’s list can be viewed at: www.coalexit.org/database.

 

The 2018 CPDL is based on the following criteria: Quantity (number of MW planned), Geography (the list is geographically weighted to cover all countries where coal power projects over 300 MW are planned) and Ownership (the list is based on equity and not on Engineering, Procurement and Construction or supply contracts). 


The CPDL was conceived as a “short list” to guide investors’ first divestment steps. It is part of a larger database called the Global Coal Exit List, which provides information on over 700 companies with significant coal-related business activities. For information on new coal plants in the pipeline, Urgewald uses CoalSwarm’s Global Coal Plant Tracker and supplements it with research of its own. We also do research on the investors of the companies listed in the CPDL and will publish results later this year.


For a detailed overview and analysis of the dynamics and main players behind each individual country’s coal plant pipeline, see Urgewald’s regional briefing accompanying the Coal Plant Developers List.

Nijmegen, the Netherlands ",One step beyond coal - New policy move from Standard Chartered welcomed,Standard Chartered ,United Kingdom,Vinh Tan III coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Vietnam,"
UK bank Standard Chartered’s announcement today that it “will not directly finance any new coal-fired power plant projects, including expansions, in any location” has been welcomed by BankTrack as a positive step towards bringing the bank's finance into line with the Paris Agreement goals. 
The move makes Standard Chartered the seventeenth major international commercial bank to commit to end project finance for new coal power worldwide.  It also sees Standard Chartered go further in restricting climate-destructive coal power finance than its competitor HSBC, which in April this year left its coal policy open to financing coal plants in Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam. 
Reacting to Standard Chartered’s announcement today, Greig Aitken, Climate campaigner at BankTrack, said:
“This is a welcome decision from Standard Chartered, especially considering that just a few months ago there were strong public signals from its Chairman that the bank maintained an appetite to remain as a coal plant financier in certain markets. Today’s announcement is another nail in the coffin for the coal industry’s tactic of presenting coal as necessary for development and poverty reduction, when clean renewable energy is now outpacing coal in terms of price and has so much potential to deliver around the world. Standard Chartered’s positive approach also puts HSBC’s loophole-ridden coal policy into sharp relief, and HSBC must now act to stop being a supporter of new coal plant construction and coal companies full stop.”
Despite this advance from Standard Chartered, its revised Position Statement on Power Generation contains no restrictions on the provision of general corporate finance to coal power companies. A range of other major European banks have already introduced restrictions to their general financing of and support for coal utilities and companies planning to develop new coal plants.  
Accompanying Standard Chartered’s revised Position Statement, the bank’s website notes that it will no longer finance new coal-fired power plants anywhere in the world “except where there is an existing commitment”. 
A Standard Chartered representative today confirmed to BankTrack that the bank remains a ‘participant’ as part of syndicates in two planned Vietnamese coal plant projects, Vung Ang 2 and Vinh Tan 3. Neither project is believed to have reached financial close, and it is unclear whether Standard Chartered will proceed with financing them. 
Greig Aitken said:
“Having made an important policy stride forward today, and with it a strong statement of its intent to act in favour of the climate and against poisonous coal pollution, we hope to see Standard Chartered proving the integrity of its new policy by shortly removing itself from syndicates for any new coal power plants, including projects in Vietnam in which it has been involved as a syndicate member.”
Notes for editors:
1. See Standard Chartered’s revised Position Statement on Power Generation. 

 

Standard Chartered is ranked 12th globally in terms of lending (project finance and corporate finance) on BankTrack’s list of coal plant developer banks, with loans amounting to USD 1.89 billion between 2014 and September 2017.

Warsaw, Poland ","Major new coal support loan for Poland's PGE, international bank consortium slammed",Banco Santander ,Spain,Polska Grupa Energetyczna (PGE) ,energy plants - coal | energy plants - nuclear | mining - coal ,Poland,"
European anti-coal campaigners have slammed the decision by an international consortium of commercial banks to provide a loan of more than EUR 950 million to support the coal development activities of PGE (Polska Grupa Energetyczna), Poland’s biggest utility and one of Europe’s top polluters.
Italy’s Intesa Sanpaolo, Japan’s MUFG Bank and Spain’s Santander make up the consortium, along with Poland’s Powszechna Kasa Oszczędności Bank, which has signed this week’s PLN 4.1 billion financing arrangement with PGE. 
The loan is expected to support PGE, already 91% dependent on coal for its total energy generation, in its PLN 1.9 billion upgrading of existing coal plant assets to comply with new EU pollution standards, as well as its PLN 15 billion investment in three other new coal units.
Already notorious for its lignite-fueled Bełchatów power plant, Europe’s largest polluter, PGE has started constructing 2.3 gigawatts of new coal capacity at Opole and Turów which could fire for the next 30 to 40 years. At Opole, the two proposed hard coal-fired units (900 megawatts each) are estimated to cost EUR 2.6 billion (PLN 11 billion); at Turów, a new lignite powered unit of approximately 0.5 gigawatts has an estimated budget of EUR 0.9 billion (PLN 4 billion).
Kuba Gogolewski, Senior Finance Campaigner at Polish NGO Foundation “Development YES - Open-Pit Mines NO”, commented:
“It is hugely disappointing to see international banks strongly encouraging Poland’s biggest polluter to keep on polluting. PGE’s carbon emissions rose by 6.3% in 2017, they have been climbing once again in 2018 and this major new investment from so-called responsible financiers has the potential to lock in new coal plant development when there is no longer space in Europe’s carbon budget for any new coal expansion.
“With the stranded asset risk from coal expansion really starting to kick in around the world and becoming a new reality rather than a threat, we are seeing increasing signs from banks that they are stepping out of coal finance because of the financial and reputational risks. However, the Polish coal industry continues to exert a strange influence over bankers who should know better. Notably, this new deal was kept under wraps until its sudden announcement this week, and investors in the banks involved should be concerned by secretive, highly risky investments such as this one.”
Of the international lenders involved in this new PGE loan deal, Intesa Sanpaolo and Santander are two of the least progressive major European banks in terms of coal finance restrictions introduced in recent years. In May this year, Japan’s MUFG finally introduced its first restriction on coal financing when it committed to stop providing direct project finance for coal plant projects other than those which use ‘ultrasupercritical’ technology. MUFG’s new policy does not include restrictions on providing general corporate finance for utilities such as PGE. 
Yann Louvel, Climate campaigner at BankTrack, commented:
“With coal lending at this scale, and with the potential huge climate and health damage it will inflict, it’s as if Intesa Sanpaolo, Santander and MUFG are issuing a ‘Come and target us’ invitation to campaigners and the public. Public intolerance of this kind of irresponsible financing is growing, and these banks and others will be in the firing line of BankTrack’s forthcoming ‘Fossil Banks, No Thanks!’ campaign. Intesa and Santander are long overdue to introduce policy restrictions for their coal financing. This new deal also illustrates the limitations of MUFG’s recent policy change – it appears to be essentially coal business as usual at the bank.”
Dave Jones, European power and coal analyst at Sandbag, said: 
“PGE has decided to double-down with a huge coal investment programme through to 2022. But now that carbon prices have quadrupled to a meaningful level, these are the last investments that should make sense. It's a huge disappointment that both utilities and banks are trailing on the times.”
Alessandro Runci, Campaigner at Re:Common, said: 
“With this decision to finance PGE’s coal expansion, Intesa is proving itself to be one of the most irresponsible European banks when it comes to fossil fuels financing. The money that Intesa has loaned to PGE will cause yet more harm to people and to our climate, and the secrecy that surrounded this deal shows that Intesa and the other banks are well aware of that. Pressure on Intesa is going to rise until its management stops betting against the Paris Agreement.”
Shin Furuno, Japan Divestment Campaigner at 350.org, said: 


“As a responsible corporate citizen, MUFG must recognise that financing coal development is against the objectives of the Paris Agreement and demonstrates the Financial Group's inadequate response to managing climate risk. Investors and customers alike will likely see this funding for PGE in Poland as another example of MUFG actively funding coal and ignoring the global transition towards decarbonisation. We urge MUFG to revise its Environmental and Social Policy Framework to exclude any new finance for coal fired power projects and companies involved in coal development.”

Nijmegen & Berlin ",RWE financiers urged to join DekaBank call to stop destruction of Hambach forest,DekaBank ,Germany,Hambach open-cast mine ,mining - coal ,Germany,"
Following Dekabank’s welcome public call on RWE to suspend clearing work at Hambach forest in Germany, European civil society campaigners are urging other financiers to follow suit and reconsider their financial ties with the coal utility.
German and European civil society organisations sent a letter last week to the 47 main financiers of RWE, asking them to reconsider their business with the company given its ongoing push to expand lignite mining at the cost of the forest and local villages . Since then the call has become more urgent, with a massive, heavy-handed police presence now on the site, clearing the way for RWE to continue clearcutting the ancient forest on October 14 .
RWE is forging ahead with its destructive plans despite admitting that the planned new lignite plant that would be fed by the mine is unlikely to be built, and while refusing to wait for the outcomes of the German Coal Commission, which was established by the German government to agree an end date and a pathway for a full coal phase-out. Both developments could eliminate the need for mine expansion.
Dekabank, one of RWE’s main shareholders, is the first financier to react to the NGO call. In a tweet last Friday, Dekabank stated that “RWE should suspend clearing work until the final result of the coal commission currently meeting has been achieved.” 
Part of the Deka Group, one of Germany’s major securities service providers, Dekabank continued: “As shareholders, we have no benefit from an escalation. On the contrary, we see the risk that RWE will unnecessarily jeopardise its reputation and future viability.”
Katrin Ganswindt, from the German NGO urgewald, commented: “Such statements are an important signal to RWE and the coal industry. If RWE does not give in, Deka Investment will have to sell its RWE shares. The example of RWE also shows that Deka Investment must finally adopt comprehensive exclusion criteria for coal and arms investments as well as for other sensitive sectors.”
Yann Louvel, Climate campaigner at BankTrack, continued: “This first answer from Dekabank is welcome and sets a precedent for other financiers to make public their reaction to the latest provocation of RWE. Given the latest developments and the escalation on site, we call on all financiers, lenders, shareholders or bondholders, to publicly speak out against the destruction of the Hambach forest and exert pressure on RWE to await the recommendations of the coal commission if they don’t want to see their reputation tarnished by their association with this dodgy company.”
Kathrin Gutmann, Europe Beyond Coal Campaign Director, concluded: “RWE is Europe’s biggest polluter, number one in terms of CO2 emissions and number two in terms of premature deaths caused by coal pollution. It is totally unacceptable for the company to blatantly ignore the work of the coal commission, creating irreversible damage and escalating conflict. It is now time for responsible financial institutions to speak out against RWE’s bad faith actions and show that there are consequences for its behaviour.”

",New report reveals Japanese financial institutions’ substantial role in climate crisis,Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) ,Japan,,,,"
Today, a report produced by 350.org Japan revealed that since the Paris Climate Accord was concluded Japanese financial institutions have increased their financing of domestic coal power development.  

From January 2013 to July 2018, 151 Japanese financial groups and their subsidiaries surveyed (including banks, asset management firms and insurance companies) provided approximately US$80 billion in loans and underwriting services to 26 Japanese companies involved in coal development, fossil fuels, and nuclear power. The surveyed institutions also invested approximately US$12 billion in the bonds and shares of those companies.

The research also showed Japanese financial institutions increased their loans and underwriting services to the companies engaged in coal development after the Paris Climate Accord was signed in 2015. Mizuho Financial, Sumitomo Financial Group and Mitsubishi UFJ were the top three creditors and provided approximately 62% of the credit identified as attributable to coal development.

To date, 964 institutions representing US$6.24 trillion assets under management have pledged to divest from their investments in coal, oil, and gas companies for moral, political, and economic reasons. The Japanese financial sector is an obvious outlier, trailing its international peers in the trend towards fossil fuel divestment.
 
“These findings stand contrary to the positive movements that have been emerging from the Japanese financial sector to restrict new financing to coal power plants,” stated Shin Furuno, Japan Divestment Campaigner for 350.org. “European and American financial institutions are moving quickly not only to restrict new finance to coal projects but to divest from all coal related companies, in recognition of the risk that coal will become a stranded asset. The potential for a carbon bubble leaves Japan’s economy substantially vulnerable, where exposure to coal is high in both the public and private sectors.”

350.org Japan’s report also revealed 38 financial institutions found to have no financial relationships with any of the selected companies engaged in coal development, fossil fuels, and nuclear power. In a recent 350.org Japan poll, nearly 60% of 2000 Japanese respondents surveyed answered that they would like for their bank to commit to socially and environmentally responsible lending and investment policies.
 
“Japanese people are becoming more and more aware of the dangerous effects of climate change through the record breaking heat and catastrophic rainfall that the country experienced this summer and it is absurd that Japan’s major banks are continuing to fund new coal fired power development which will only worsen these impacts,” added Furuno. “350.org Japan will encourage financial institutions who were found to be fossil fuel and nuclear free to verify those findings so that Japanese people can choose greener banking alternatives that do not worsen the global climate crisis.”

Paris ",Climate: Société Générale targeted by “clean-up” actions across France,Société Générale ,France,Rio Grande LNG Terminal ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,United States,"
On the occasion of a global day of climate mobilisations, 38 “clean-up” actions were carried out in Société Générale branches by Friends of the Earth France and Non-Violent Action COP21. They called on the bank, France’s biggest financier of dirty energy, to put an end to its support for fossil fuels, and particularly for the Texan shale gas export project Rio Grande LNG. The groups also announced a giant action at the bank’s central Paris branch on December 14, at the end of COP24, if Société Générale does not revise its policy.


Armed with sponges, brooms and mops, more than 600 activists from Friends of the Earth France and Non-Violent Action COP21 (ANV-COP21) have scoured, scrubbed and polished 38 Société Générale branches in France . In Paris and from Nantes to Sallanches and Dunkirk to Aix-en-Provence, the common slogan was: “since Société Générale is the champion of dirty energy, let’s clean it up!” Société Générale takes the lead among French banks in its support for dirty energies including coal, shale gas, tar sands, ultra-deepwater drilling and Arctic drilling. It is also supporting Trump’s climacidal policies as the biggest French bank financier of shale gas exports in North America: in 2017 alone the bank has channelled $1.1 billion to this sector .


Activists called on the bank to change course and make a public commitment at the Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco from September 12th to 14th. Lorette Philippot, from Friends of the Earth France, said: “We have decided to give Société Générale a hand today to encourage the bank to stop its massive support for fossil fuels. Even BNP Paribas, which was until recently the worst French bank in this field, agreed to adopt a policy to make its activities less harmful for the climate, the environment and rights of local communities and particularly indigenous peoples. It is baffling for Société Générale not to also take these fundamental issues into account. We call on the bank, as a priority, to withdraw from the Rio Grande shale gas export terminal project in Texas, which would alone emit as much as 44 coal plants”.


A call  was launched the same day by 20 organisations, including North-American NGOs and people impacted by the Texan project, to organise a giant cleaning action of the bank’s central Paris branch on December 14, the last day of COP24, if the bank does not publicly announce a revision of its policy before then. Elodie Nace, from ANV-COP21, continued: “We invite all citizens to join us on December 14 at Société Générale branch on 29 Boulevard Haussmann, to organise a giant cleaning action at the bank. The climate crisis is now obvious, and we cannot let a French bank continue to aggravate this ongoing climate disaster! Société Générale must understand that their days of impunity are over, and the Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco is a good opportunity to remind them of that”.


The mobilisation targeting Société Générale was organised as part of the global day of action for climate including marches across France and international initiatives under the Rise For Climate banner . It reflects the determination of citizens who, faced with the climate urgency, do not hesitate to take part in civil disobedience. Some of them have been trained to non-violent action as part of the Alternatiba tour, a vast popular mobilisation on climate, ending in Bayonne on October 6th and 7th with a village of alternatives bringing together more than 200 civil society figures and tens of thousands of citizens.  

Notes for editors:

A crowdfunder for the ad raised an incredible A$10,225 from donors.
Standard Chartered, a big funder of coal-fired power stations in Southeast Asia, is currently updating its position statement on coal. With the bank now poised to fund three proposed coal power projects in Vietnam, organisations including Market Forces are asking it to drop these plans and rule out backing any future dirty coal plants.
“This ad sent a message Standard Chartered can’t ignore. We’ll keep the pressure on the bank to lead the way and be the clean energy leader South East Asia and the world needs,” said Julien Vincent, executive director of Market Forces.
“If the world is to meet the agreed goal of keeping global warming to less than 2ºC, 80 per cent of existing fossil fuel reserves cannot be burned. Financing new coal-fired power stations is simply off the cards.”

",New coal report finds troubling loopholes in existing bank policies,Bank of America ,United States,,,,"
Following Trump’s inauguration, major US banks increased financing for coal, demonstrating loopholes in policies adopted in response to the Paris Agreement. A new report, published by Rainforest Action Network (RAN), analyzes the six biggest US banks and finds that 2017 was a year of major backsliding on coal mining finance, with banks increasing overall financing between 16% (Citi) and an incredible 3,014% (JPMorgan Chase) compared to 2016 – while at the same time appearing to comply with their recently adopted policies on the sector.
“The numbers show that US banks are in step with Trump’s pro-coal agenda,” said Patrick McCully, Climate and Energy Program Director at RAN. “With an administration that’s pushing us backwards, financial institutions must do their part to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.”
Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo committed to reduce credit exposure to the coal mining industry, and Goldman Sachs instituted a narrower coal mining policy. These banks have so far not reported on their performance against their policies. The report approximates the banks’ credit exposure to 50 top coal mining companies and calculates overall financing (lending and underwriting) to those companies.
The report also finds that the banks’ policy commitments have significant loopholes. Despite banks’ compliance with credit exposure commitments, they continue providing new financing to the coal industry – even significantly increasing this financing – so long as enough old loans come off the books at the same time. Of the five banks with exposure-reduction commitments, Bank of America, Citi and JPMorgan Chase limit that commitment to pure-play coal companies, which represent just half of production. In addition, policies on credit exposure restrict only certain types of loans. Underwriting and B-term loans account for more overall coal mining financing than on-the-books lending, but all US banks put little to no restrictions on these forms of coal financing.
“Solely reducing credit exposure is the wrong objective,” said Jason Disterhoft, Climate and Energy Senior Campaigner at RAN. “Instead, banks should commit to year-on-year reductions of their overall financing, including all types of loans and underwriting services for all coal mining companies, with a declared zero date. We need a rapid phase-out of coal and stronger policies to get us there.”

",Dutch Banking Sector Agreement on Human Rights publishes first annual report plus leverage and cocoa papers,ABN AMRO ,Netherlands,,,,"
This week the Dutch Banking Sector Agreement on International Responsible Business Conduct Regarding Human Rights published its first Annual Report, covering implementation of the agreement over the year 2017.

 

The report’s publication was accompanied by the launch of the first two significant reports to arise from the Agreement, and a third draft report for consultation. These are:

The Phase I Progress Report of the “Increasing Leverage” working group, which explores good practices for banks and other parties to the Agreement for increasing their leverage, jointly or individually, for the benefit of people facing adverse human rights impacts,
An analysis of the Cocoa Value Chain Analysis, from the Value Chain Working Group which conducts mapping exercises of high-risk sectors that are material to the banks, and  
A draft Pal Oil Value Chain Analysis which is open for consultation until 30th September.

The Dutch Banking Sector Agreement, signed in October 2016, is a multi-stakeholder agreement between Dutch banks, trade unions, civil society organisations and the Dutch government, through which the parties agree to work collaboratively towards full implementation by Dutch banks of their human rights responsibilities. The Agreement is one of a number of ‘Responsible Business Conduct Agreements’ for different business sectors, which are seen as an alternative approach to regulation. The Dutch government has determined that legislative intervention may be forthcoming if these agreements do not deliver sufficient results.

 

The Annual Report includes details of the Independent Monitoring Committee’s recommendations after the Agreement’s first full year of implementation, together with the Steering Committee’s responses. It its recommendations, the Independent Monitoring Committee:

'encourages the Parties and the adhering banks to mark the Agreement as a sufficiently high priority in order to yield the foreseen results in 2018'
calls for 'a more specific plan as to how to further narrow' the 'considerable difference in expertise and experience between the adhering banks in the area of business and human rights'
'observed that at least three banks are still at an initial stage with respect to their deliverables for 2018 Q2 and it seems unlikely they will be able to deliver in time' and
'suggest that the Government could play a more active role in making a success of the Agreement ... unless the Government is anticipating that legislation is inevitable'.

BankTrack welcomed the Agreement on its release as an ambitious document with far-reaching commitments, while noting that it falls short in some important areas and committing to keeping a close eye on its implementation. We will provide further commentary on the Annual Report and publications in the coming weeks.

The Hague ",ING stops financing new coal power plant in Dominican Republic,ING ,Netherlands,Punta Catalina-Hatillo coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Dominican Republic,"
ING has stopped financing a new coal-fired power plant in the Dominican Republic, the bank informed the Dutch Fair Bank Guide today. The Fair Bank Guide welcomes ING's decision. The Fair Bank Guide, in collaboration with BankTrack and Greenpeace, has been calling ING for years to stop financing two new coal-fired plants, Punta Catalina and Cirebon in Indonesia.
ING sold its stake in the Punta Catalina coal-fired power plant on 13 July. With this decision, the bank wants to give further substance to the tightening of its coal policy in December 2017.
The construction of the new coal-fired power station in the Dominican Republic is surrounded by corruption scandals. The local population and local community organizations have been protesting for years against its construction, due to concerns about corruption and climate change. Critical questions were asked in the Dutch parliament at the end of last year about ING's financing of the Punta Catalina coal-fired power plant.
Peter Ras, project manager for the Fair Bank Guide, said: ""ING's decision not to grant any further funding to the new coal-fired power station in the Dominican Republic is good news. The Fair Bank Guide finds it very important that banks stop all investments in coal companies. And reduce their financing for fossil energy companies in favour of financing sustainable energy. We hope that ING will also discontinue its financing of the new coal-fired power station in Indonesia, where the local population is also seriously concerned for its health and climate impacts.""
Research by the Fair Bank Guide in November 2015 showed that ING invested eight times more in fossil energy companies than in sustainable energy companies. Of its loans to energy companies in the period 2009 - 2014, 89% went to the fossil energy sector. In total, during this period ING financed US$ 24.5 billion in fossil energy companies and energy generation, including coal companies. In contrast, the bank’s financed to renewable energy companies in the same period amounted to only only US$ 2.9 billion. ING has since tightened its policy towards the coal sector, and the Fair Bank Guide will publish a new study into banks’ energy sector investments in November 2018.

",Liberian communities harassed after calling on banks to halt $1.5 billion loan to Wilmar over landgrabbing concerns,DBS ,Singapore,Wilmar International ,agriculture - palm oil ,Singapore,"
Commercial banks that were lining up to join a $1.5 billion syndicated loan for the palm oil giant Wilmar International are apparently reconsidering the deal due to concerns about land grabbing and other human rights abuses connected to the company’s investments in Liberia. Communities affected by the Maryland Oil Palm Plantation in southern Liberia have called on banks to refrain from joining the loan unless Wilmar commits to remedial action to address their grievances.
The plantation is operated by the Ivorian firm SIFCA, which Wilmar owns a significant stake in and advises on palm oil operations. Affected communities say the project has caused loss of land and livelihoods, desecration of sacred sites, and destruction of crops and water sources. The plantation has used state security forces to silence dissent, according to community members.
“Any loan to Wilmar must be conditioned on the remediation of harms and human rights abuses caused by Maryland Oil Palm Plantation to communities in Liberia and an immediate halt to the ongoing use of security personnel to harass and intimidate the local population,” said Francis Colee, Head of Programs at Green Advocates International, a Liberian civil society organization. “Failure to do so will expose Wilmar’s financiers to unacceptable human rights and reputational risks, leaving them with no choice but to stay away from this and future deals.”
Liberian civil society organizations and community leaders warned lenders about the human rights and environmental violations associated with the plantation in a June 8 letter. The signatories sent the letter after learning that Wilmar had tapped seven banks, including Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil member HSBC, to arrange the $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. The proceeds are for general corporate purposes, including funding the working capital requirements of Wilmar’s subsidiaries such as SIFCA.
“The banks have apparently placed this deal on hold, pending more information from Wilmar,” said David Pred, Executive Director of Inclusive Development International.
In response to the community’s concerns, BNP Paribas informed Inclusive Development International and Green Advocates that Wilmar was conducting “an on-the-ground assessment” of the plantation. In reality, however, that assessment has appeared to be nothing more than an exercise in intimidation of the letter’s signatories. Local government officials have gone house to house asking the signatories to confirm whether they in fact signed the letter and why they did so. They have been accused of being anti-development and opposing the newly elected Liberian government. Some community members have reportedly been threatened, and Green Advocates has faced at least three security incidents.
“This is a classic a response from the government of Liberia and its transnational corporation partners operating in Liberia. We have seen this over and over. Community concerns and grievances characterized as anti- government, anti-development and anti-investment, said Alfred Brownell, Lead Campaigner and Legal Counsel.
“These attempts to harass and intimidate people raising legitimate human rights concerns are outrageous,” Pred said. “SIFCA and the plantation’s staff should know that the world’s largest banks are paying close attention to what is happening in Maryland County.”
In 2010, SIFCA received a concession to establish the 8,800-hectare project on a plantation that had fallen into disrepair during the Liberian civil war. SIFCA, which has roots in coffee and cocoa production, leaned heavily on Wilmar and another Singaporean palm oil giant, Olam, to get the plantation up and running. Wilmar and Olam each bought 13.53% stakes in SIFCA in 2007 through the holding company Nauvu.
In March of this year, Wilmar doubled down on its investment, buying out Olam’s shares for $194 million, giving it a 27.06% stake in SIFCA. When the plantation begins producing on a significant scale in the near future, Wilmar is expected to distribute the palm oil through its global supply chain.
The environmental, social and reputational risks of financing Wilmar are not limited to Liberia:

In February 2017, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) found that Wilmar had illegally appropriated land from indigenous people in West Sumatra, Indonesia, without securing their free, prior and informed consent, in a rare finding of culpability against a major palm oil producer.
In March 2017, Nestle expressed alarm over evidence that Wilmar was illegally clearing protected forestland in Sumatra, Indonesia.
In 2015, a Wilmar subsidiary was sued for land grabs in Uganda. Wilmar was also accused that year of land grabs in Nigeria.
Wilmar has ESG scores of 30.5 out of 100 by Sustainalytics and 41 out of 100 by RebecoSAM. Bloomberg rates the company worse than its peers in both environmental and governance performance. Newsweek’s 2012 Green Rankings index rated Wilmar the world’s worst company out of 500 in terms of environmental practices.

The community letter to the lead arrangers of the loan (Westpac, DBS Group, HSBC, Mizuhu, MUFG & MUFG Securities Asia, OCBC, and United Overseas Bank) is available here.

",Judge dismisses DAPL case against BankTrack in full: our reaction,,,Dakota Access Pipeline ,energy distribution | oil and gas,United States,"
The lawsuit filed against BankTrack by Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), the company behind the Dakota Access Pipeline, has been dismissed by a North Dakota District Court. The judge ruled that Energy Transfer had failed to state a plausible Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act (RICO) claim against BankTrack, and that without that, the court has no jurisdiction over BankTrack for the additional non-federal claims. 

The judge’s dismissal can be downloaded here.

The judgement reaches far beyond a narrow focus on BankTrack's advocacy, making clear that ETP's arguments represent a ""dangerously broad"" application of RICO that would allow governments and corporations ""to curtail almost any disagreeable, arguably protected speech"". While the judgment focuses on BankTrack's advocacy activity, including writing to banks and publishing commentary on their activities, ETP's complaint is packed full of attempts to characterise the everyday advocacy of all the defendants, including Greenpeace and others, as being somehow criminal in nature.

BankTrack director Johan Frijns said: “We’re very pleased to learn that the frivolous claims against BankTrack have been dismissed. Everything we have been saying has been vindicated. Energy Transfer’s allegations about our supposed involvement in directing acts of “radical ecoterrorism” were hard to take seriously from the outset, and we are pleased that the judge has confirmed that these were sweeping statements without any basis in fact.

“BankTrack raised legitimate human rights concerns arising from the Dakota Access Pipeline with the banks financing the project. The judge’s decision confirms that this type of advocacy work is legitimate and is not “reasonably or plausibly related” to any acts of criminal conduct, as was alleged by Energy Transfer. 

“We hope the judge will now similarly dismiss the case against the other defendants, and that the ringing rejection of this case will discourage other corporations from launching these kinds of Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation. BankTrack is grateful to our lawyer, Robin Martinez, and to EarthRights International, for their exceptional and tireless work in helping us resist this case.”

Marco Simons, General Counsel of EarthRights International, which serves as consulting counsel for BankTrack in the lawsuit, commented: ""Corporations attempting to silence criticism of their conduct have started turning to the RICO statute, and Judge Wilson's decision is a strong rebuke to this tactic. The opinion makes clear that however much a company like Energy Transfer Partners dislikes public criticism of its projects, it cannot use RICO to argue that its critics are involved in organized crime. This is the right interpretation of the law, and it should shut down similar efforts against other advocates and nonprofits.""

BankTrack, Earth First! and Greenpeace were named as defendants in the lawsuit by Energy Transfer Equity and Energy Transfer Partners, the companies behind the Dakota Access Pipeline, in September 2017. The lawsuit alleged that BankTrack, along with other environmental advocacy groups ""manufactured and disseminated materially false and misleading information about Energy Transfer and the Dakota Access Pipeline"" and ""incited, funded, and facilitated crimes and acts of terrorism to further these objectives."" BankTrack’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit was filed in November 2017. ETP has a right to appeal the judge's decision.
The judge’s dismissal can be downloaded here.

London ",HSBC and Standard Chartered accused of “rank hypocrisy” for financing of highly polluting coal projects whilst publicly supporting Paris Climate Agreement ,HSBC ,United Kingdom,Long Phu I coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Vietnam,"
HSBC and Standard Chartered are in line to finance six coal plants in Vietnam and Indonesia, expected to have annual C02 emissions of 44 million tonnes. This is despite HSBC and Standard Chartered’s public support for the Paris Climate Agreement. HSBC recently announced a new coal policy that allows coal financing in Indonesia, Vietnam and Bangladesh until 2023. There are indications that Standard Chartered will adopt a similar policy as they reassess their coal policy this summer.
Stuart McWilliam, Climate Change Campaign Manager at Global Witness, said:
“The consequences could be dire if Standard Chartered decide to follow HSBC's approach. These plans will be terrible for the climate and will contribute to thousands more deaths from toxic air. These loans create an increasing risk for investors. For these banks to take this kind of action whilst publicly supporting the commitments made in the Paris Climate Agreement is rank hypocrisy.
“Both banks should urgently join the growing group of major banks worldwide who are ending all support for coal power.”
The Global Witness briefing published today states that:

Coal power makes poverty worse in developing countries, rather than alleviating it
Harvard University research shows that 70,000 people will die in South East Asia every year from air pollution by 2030, if current coal plant expansion plans go ahead
The wasted capital involved in these coal plants could amount to US $15.3 billion, creating an increasing risk for HSBC and Standard Chartered’s investors
HSBC and Standard Chartered are ignoring overwhelming scientific evidence that expanding coal power is incompatible with achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement

Global Witness is urging HSBC and Standard Chartered to cancel their planned involvement in these plants and join the Royal Bank of Scotland and 15 other international commercial banks, which have committed to stop financing coal plants anywhere in the world.

Tokyo ",Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank announces end of new coal power project financing,Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings ,Japan,,,,"
Today, media sources reported that Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank is signaling its intent to restrict financing for new coal plant projects regardless of their location, making it the first Japanese bank to move forward on this.
Shin Furuno, 350.org Japan Divestment Campaigner, issued the following statement on this development:

“Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Banks’s plan to  restrict project finance for new coal-fired power plants regardless of their geographic location has the potential to be the strongest policy announced by any bank in Asia(1), matching the recent announcement by Nippon Life Insurance (2).This policy, if fully implemented, places Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank ahead of other financial groups in Japan in aligning their lending policies with the Paris Agreement.
The record breaking rains and heat we have been experiencing in Japan and across the globe are stark reminders of the worsening impacts of climate change and tell us in no uncertain terms that fossil fuels need to be phased out immediately, starting with cutting their funding lines
In recent months, the three major banks, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Mizuho Financial Group, and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, have all announced updated policies for lending to coal-power plants, but all stopped short of discontinuing financing for these projects. (3)
There is, however, reason for concern, as project financing for coal-fired power plants currently under negotiations may be exempted from this policy and others on a case-by-case basis. This may prove to be a loophole that could defeat the purpose of this policy, so we call on Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank to fully implement the policy without exceptions.
We will be keeping a close watch on the implementation of this policy and have high hopes that Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank will show leadership and continue to set the example by moving to divest from companies dependent on coal power and mining.”

London ",Greenpeace block Barclays’ HQ over dirty oil pipeline funding,Barclays ,United Kingdom,Line 3 Pipeline Replacement Project (L3RP) ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,United States,"
Thursday 19th July, 2018. London. Today at 7.00am 40 Greenpeace UK volunteers have taken over the main entrance to Barclays Bank’s corporate headquarters near Canary Wharf in London’s docklands. The protest is against the bank’s refusal to stop funding pipelines to take oil from Canada’s tar sands to market in the USA and Asia.
Activists dressed as bankers are also inside the building, playing recorded messages from Barclays customers and affected communities in Canada to the bank’s executives. Six climbers have scaled the entrance’s portico, where they have recreated a tar sands oil leak dripping down from the bank’s logo. The team are also hanging banners, decorating the bank with giant stickers and handing out leaflets to inform the staff about the impacts of the banks dirty funding decisions. 
Since HSBC’s recent change in policy, Barclays is the only UK bank still choosing to fund the three oil pipelines planned from Canada’s Alberta province to Canada’s Pacific coast, and the USA.
Hannah Martin, oil campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said - 
“Barclays have been ignoring the damage their dirty funding decisions are doing to the world, and to Indigenous communities in North America, so we’ve brought a little taste of what they’re trying to ignore right to their doorstep. Tar sands are a climate disaster. Tar sand produce more than twice the carbon of an average barrel of oil, and a tar sands oil spill is even worse than a normal crude oil spill - the oil sinks in water, making it almost impossible to clean up. We need to hold them to account for the damage they’re causing.”
Many of Barclays’ customers have contacted Greenpeace to express their concern about what their bank is doing, and a Greenpeace petition asking Barclays to stop financing tar sands pipelines received 40,000 signatures in the first 24 hours, 12,000 of which were from Barclays’ customers. Greenpeace activists are now relaying those concerns to Barclays executives through mobile sound systems.
Ocean Hyland, from the Tsleil-Waututh Nation in Canada’s British Columbia province, is at the protest to tell Barclays about the threat to communities posed by the pipelines, one of which will end at the inlet from which her people took their name and much of their food. She said – 
“Industrialisation poisoned our home, and we spent forty years repairing that damage, until finally, two years ago, we were able to safely eat clams harvested from the inlet again. A tar sands pipeline will increase oil tanker traffic in the inlet seven-fold, and put our inlet and all of our work at risk.  I urge Barclays to reconsider its involvement in this project, and avoid funding the further destruction of my people and the planet.”
ENDS

Poland ",NGOs apply for annulment of the Ostrołęka C integrated permit- costly consequences of Jan Szyszko’s decision,,,Ostroleka C coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Poland,"

In September 2016, the Minister of the Environment Jan Szyszko, issued a controversial decision, favorable for the investor, and overturned the lawful decision which the Marshal of the Masovian Voivodeship had issued. In accordance with the provisions of the Environmental Protection Law, the integrated permit for a new installation specifies the two-year period to start exploitation. If the installation is not operating within two years from that date, the permit automatically expires. Most importantly, the Act does not provide the possibility to extend or interrupt this period. In the case of the Ostrołęka C power plant, the two-year deadline started to run in June 2016. The investor reminded himself about it a month later. Knowing that the launch of a new power plant within two years is unrealistic, the investor applied to the Marshal of the Masovian Voivodeship for a change of the starting emissions date, already established in the integrated permit. The Marshal rightly stated that this would mean an unacceptable termination of the term established in the Act and refused the change. Unfortunately, after the investor's dismissal, Jan Szyszko changed the commencement of operation date. In our opinion, the Minister's decision was issued with a flagrant breach of law - explains Miłosz Jakubowski, legal advisor at the Frank Bold Foundation.
It is outrageous that Minister Szyszko justified his decision in favour for extending the IPPC with the social interest while it resulted in the acceptance of higher levels of emissions of dangerous contaminants. The permit is not in line with the BAT standards that have been put in place to protect human health and the environment. It is not in the public interest to allow greater pollution of dangerous substances. Once again Minister Szyszko’s decision turns out to be harmful - comments Diana Maciąga from the Association Workshop for All Beings.

 
The current integrated permit has a number of shortcomings. It does not specify two basic parameters, such as the gross electric power and the net electric power, making the calculation of the electrical efficiency impossible. It is worth mentioning that electrical efficiency co-decides whether the installation meets the requirements of the BAT standards. Estimation of the pollutants amount is also not possible because this document does not include the power plant’s operating time. Last but not least, the integrated permit does not specify the obligation to monitor the emission of heavy metals such as mercury, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, nickel, lead or zinc.


Numerous experts point out that Ostrołęka C power plant project is burdened with some serious investment risks - its costs are significantly underestimated due to the need for modernization (in accordance with the BAT requirements) and an increase in prices of CO2 emission allowances. In addition, Ostrołęka C is unlikely to receive the expected support from the capacity market. The adjustment to BAT standards will cost around 500-600 million PLN. Experts estimate that if, instead of developing Ostrołęka C, renewable energy would be developed, the created investment market would amount between 10 and 17 billion PLN on a national scale or from 670 to 870 million PLN for the Ostrołęka region.
Ostrołęka C is an undesirable project not only economically but also socially. The investment also has a problem with finding financing. Maintaining an integrated permit in the legal circulation is also in question. Upon signing the contract with Ostrołęka C Power Plant, the GE Power-Alstom consortium should be expecting significant delays, serious problems during the construction of the unit and reputational costs - sums up Diana Maciąga
Jan Szyszko was Poland’s Minister for Environment between November 2015 and January 2018. He is infamous for devastation of the unique Białowieza Forest which sparked international outrage and a major fightback within the Polish society.

Poland ",Polish NGOs caution Prime Minister Morawiecki to stop plans for new coal power plant,,,Ostroleka C coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Poland,"
“As a coalition of NGOs working for climate protection and just transformation of energy supply in Poland, we were happy to hear your declaration of preparing Polish economy for the climatic and civilizational challenges that will shape Polish energy policies for decades to come” – say letter’s signatories. They are calling on Prime Minister Morawiecki for preventing construction of the power plant and supporting just transition towards renewable energy and energy efficiency instead.
Ostrołęka C with a capacity of 1000 MW is the newest TPP planned in Poland. The project has been criticized by industry experts, who question its cost-effectiveness and indispensability to Poland’s energy system. Health costs of its expected 40-year operation have been estimated at up to 100,000 cases of asthma attacks in children and approx. 2,000 premature deaths. Developing renewable energy, which seems to be a good alternative for Ostrołęka C, could create up to 1200% more jobs and an investment market reaching from PLN 10 to 17 billion for the country, and between PLN 670 and 870 million for the region. As the letter was being delivered to Prime Minister’s Office, GE Power and Alstom signed a contract for the construction of Ostrołęka C TPP.
We fully agree with Prime Minister Morawiecki that the technological revolution we are witnessing means a new deal in global economy. We must ensure Poland is not left behind. Ostrołęka C power plant would keep our country from reaching its full potential - says Diana Maciąga, Association Workshop for All Beings, Poland.
The NGOs hope that the Prime Minister will use the upcoming UN COP24 Climate Summit in Katowice, Poland, as an opportunity to show that Poland is a dependable and responsible member of the international community and that it rises to the technological and ethical challenges of climate change.
“If we develop the Ostrołęka C project, we will lose a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to encourage energy that is co-produced by the people and based on innovation with Poland leading the change. Climate protection is a responsibility for our generation as well as for those to come. As the hosting country of this year’s ONZ COP24 climate change conference in Katowice – a model example of a transformation from an industrial complex into a hotbed of business and science – Poland has a special role to play.
Abandoning the plans for constructing a coal-powered power plant with an estimated 6 bn tonne emissions per year in favour of developing renewable energy sources will send a clear message that Poland is a dependable and responsible member of the international community and that it rises to the technological and ethical challenges. The climate change conference will be the perfect opportunity to announce that Poland is resigning from the plans of building that power plant, and in doing so, it is observing the stipulations of the Paris Agreement and actively collaborating in creating common climate policy” - the NGOs write.
The future of the next generations of Poles depends on the choices we are making today. We hope that the Prime Minister will help Poland avoid making the grave mistake of building a new coal power plant in the era of clean energy revolution and global efforts to secure effective and just climate protection - concludes Diana Maciąga.
The Polish Climate Coalition is formed by 24 NGOs. Its mission is to undertake joint actions to prevent human-induced climate change for the benefit of humanity and the environment. The letter was also signed by: HEAL Polska, Foundation „Development Yes - Open-Pit Mines No”, Association for Earth, FrankBold.

",BankTrack and Oxfam Australia call on banks to ensure access to remedy for victims of human rights abuses ,,,,,,"
Banks are not doing enough to ensure communities impacted by bank financed activities can get justice – a new paper by BankTrack and Oxfam Australia has found. The briefing paper “Developing Effective Grievance Mechanisms in the Banking Sector” shows that banks have barely begun to implement their responsibilities to develop grievance mechanisms under the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. 
Meanwhile, there are a growing number of cases globally where banks are considered to have contributed to human rights abuses through their finance. These include projects involving farmers being forced off their land, the destruction of sacred indigenous sites, environmental damage and violence against community members.  
The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, one of the authoritative international standards for responsible business conduct, require that all businesses, including banks, establish or participate in effective operational-level grievance mechanisms for individuals and communities who may be adversely impacted by their business.
Discussion papers produced by banks themselves on their human rights responsibilities have avoided addressing their responsibilities under the section of the Guiding Principles dealing with access to remedy .
The briefing paper explores the responsibilities of private sector banks to ensure access to remedy; sets out the benefits of operational-level grievance mechanisms to banks; and describes what such grievance mechanisms in the banking sector would look like in practice.
BankTrack and Oxfam Australia produced the paper following a series of interviews with representatives of large global banks, and extensive consultation with human rights experts and civil society organizations.
The briefing paper recommends that banks:

Acknowledge their responsibilities under the Guiding Principles regarding remedy and grievance mechanisms;
Begin by mapping accountability channels already in place and then building on them;
Ensure that all stakeholder groups, including communities affected by bank-financed projects and activities, have access to bank grievance mechanisms;
Ensure grievance mechanisms are designed with careful attention to the UN Guiding Principles’ effectiveness criteria;
Consider participating in grievance mechanisms in which a number of banks participate — which is open to communities affected by the finance of any bank participating — alongside single-bank mechanisms;
Ensure the Equator Principles Association develops an effective grievance mechanism that can assess claims that the Equator Principles standards are not being properly applied by banks and project sponsors,
Write consent into agreements with clients to publish corporate loan and project finance information related to businesses engaged in high risk areas, so that affected people know which banks are financing the activities affecting them.
Design mechanisms that are empowered and equipped to deliver remedy,
Engage with clients to ensure their own operational-level grievance mechanisms are effective,
Seek guidance, including from the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the UN Working Group on Business and Human Rights, where responsibilities are unclear.

",Dutch-based banks continue to finance deforestation and land-grabbing,ABN AMRO ,Netherlands,Wilmar International ,agriculture - palm oil ,Singapore,"
Dutch-based ABN AMRO, ING and Rabobank are structurally involved in scandals concerning destruction of rainforest and land-grabbing in Asia and Africa. Although these banks have promised improvements for years, these never materialize. Friends of the Earth Netherlands (Milieudefensie) is calling on the banks to cease financing the industrial palm oil sector.
'International banks such as ABN AMRO, ING and Rabobank have simply failed to prevent abuses', says Rolf Schipper of Milieudefensie. 'By financing palm oil companies, these banks pave the way for serious human rights violations. Thousands have lost their homes, local communities have been intimidated or imprisoned. Large swathes of forest have been cleared or burnt down. It is time for the banks to fulfil their sustainable banking promises, and to withdraw their investments in the industrial palm oil sector as soon as possible.'
Black book: 100+ palm oil scandals
In the ‘Black Book’ Draw the Line, Milieudefensie identifies more than 100 scandals in which major Dutch international banks are currently involved or have been involved. With their publication, Milieudefensie is illustrating the gigantic scale of the problems for the first time. The 118 scandals involve 14 palm oil companies in 9 countries in Asia and Africa.
Liberia: relinquishing land under the threat of guns
Milieudefensie and Friends of the Earth Liberia (Sustainable Development Institute) investigated the palm oil industry and investors' involvements in Liberia. Palm Oil Company Golden Veroleum Liberia (GVL) is taking the local community’s land without their consent. 'Guns in hand, armed police forced us to consent to the taking of our land', states a resident of Liberia. Golden Veroleum Liberia has ignored a ‘stop-work order’ for the contested plots of land by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). Instead, GVL continues to clear land, field research has shown.
No protection for residents
'In the forests of Liberia, ""might is right"" ', says James Otto of Friends of the Earth Liberia (the Sustainable Development Institute). 'Local people are being trampled by major palm oil companies, and the government has not raised a single finger to protect them. GVL does not let anyone stand in its way.'
This week, James Otto is in the Netherlands to sound the alarm with the Dutch-based banks ABN AMRO and Rabobank. These banks are financing parts of Golden Agri-Resources, the primary investor of GVL.
Banks have known for over fifteen years
Milieudefensie has been addressing the banks since 2001 about the abuses at play in the palm oil sector. The banks, however, refuse to acknowledge the structural nature of the palm oil sector’s issues. Rolf Schipper points out, 'Banks have known what is happening ever since. And yet they continue to pump money into these dubious companies.'
Schipper: 'Milieudefensie calls on Dutch customers to contact their banks and ask them to stop these devastating investments via drawtheline.eu.'
Rolf Schipper also wants the Dutch government to commit to stricter regulations at the European and international level.
Schipper calls upon the European Union and its members states ‘to ensure a binding UN Treaty that includes the financial sector and gives access to justice for victims of corporate abuse. We need rights for people, and rules for business.'

Tokyo ",Greenpeace Japan calls for a more meaningful and clearer coal investment policy at MUFG AGM,Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) ,Japan,,,,"
Greenpeace Japan will participate in the Annual General Meeting of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group today, aiming to raise discussion about the financial group’s recently published coal investment strategy. Greenpeace Japan will participate in the AGM as a shareholder, and will engage with the company over the recently published policy, which offers no clear path towards reducing investment in coal fired-power plants.

“MUFG, along with other major Japanese banks, need to wake up to the reality of climate crisis and the changes within the international financial world that are already happening all over the world. Climate change is no longer an environmental issue, it is a paradigm shift. As countries and businesses around the world keep going forward to transform their economies to comply with the Paris Agreement, it is clear that fossil fuels will be replaced by sustainable energy solutions. The first one to drop out from energy mixes will be coal, and those who wait until the last moment to redirect their investments are set to lose relevancy, reputation and money”, says Hisayo Takada, Energy Project Leader of Greenpeace Japan.


MUFG, along with Mizuho Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Group, have recently published revised investment policies related to sustainability and energy. Unfortunately, the policies are highly insufficient when compared to recommended emission cuts from climate scientists, failing to show clear strategy for decreasing their investments in coal. Furthermore, the policies are remarkably more vague than the coal policies set by the financial institutions in other countries. The lack of clarity makes it impossible to assess how MUFG’s coal investment practices will actually change from before.
“Numerous banks in Europe and the US have already adopted policies that rule out financing coal mining and power production, some even moving on to restrict tar sands, Arctic and extreme deepwater oil. In comparison, the policy announced by MUFG doesn’t say clearly if or how it will restrict its coal financing. It says the company “supports international initiatives that are aiming to reach the objectives set by the Paris Agreement”, but by now it should be clear to everyone that any investment in new coal means you are not actually supporting the Agreement.”
The Japanese banks’ coal policies reflect the weak energy policy currently being planned by the Japanese government. While most economically advanced countries are passing policies to phase out coal from their energy mixes, the Japanese government is proposing to keep coal’s role stable until 2030. However, based on IPCC’s scenarios, it has been suggested Japan would need to bring its coal use to zero around 2030. 
“MUFG and other Japanese banks must stop hiding behind the government’s weak energy plan. I think they are serious about not losing their customers’ and investors’ money, and in that case continuing to invest in something that is clearly becoming a stranded asset doesn’t make sense. They need to show exactly what is their strategy and timeline of changing their financing of the power sector, beginning from coal.”

","“A small step forward on climate change risk management, but bolder action required” ",Mizuho Financial Group ,Japan,,,,"
On June 13, Mizuho Financial Group (Mizuho) announced its adoption of a new “sector specific policy” on responsible financing. Japanese environmental groups ー 350.org Japan, Japan Center for a Sustainable Environment and Society (JACSES), Rainforest Action Network, Greenpeace Japan, Kiko Network and Friends of the Earth Japan ー issued the following statement on Mizuho’s new policies.
“First, we welcome the fact that in the document released, Mizuho recognizes the high social and environmental risk accompanying coal-fired power, palm oil, deforestation, and the weapons industry.(1) Mizuho’s decision to make efforts to mitigate and avoid these risks in its financing and financial advisory services is a small step in the right direction. However, the policy is lacking details on the concrete actions needed to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, and further progress is required.
With regards to financing the coal-fired power generation sector, the policy states, “For projects financing coal-fired power, financing decisions will be made by comparing feasible alternative technologies which possess equivalent energy efficiency and by verifying their economic rationale.” Mizuho is the second financial group after Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) to announce such a policy on financing to the coal-fired power sector, and it represents progress compared to past policies.
However, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has made clear that meeting the Paris Agreement goal of keeping global warming well below 2 degrees requires no new coal-fired power plants to be built – no matter how efficient – and the early phase out of existing coal power. The need for the exclusion of new coal power is not reflected in Mizuho’s newly published policy. We continue to urge Japan’s megabanks including Mizuho to swiftly announce a stop to any new financing for domestic and foreign coal-fired power projects and companies involved in such projects, with a clear strategy and timeline. (2)
Additionally, under “transactions deserving special attention”, Mizuho’s new policy states that when making financing decisions it will “refer to international guidelines” while confirming the social and environmental considerations of prospective clients. Nevertheless, in April this year, the three major Japanese financial groups including Mizuho agreed to participate in financing the new polluting Nghi Son 2 coal power station in Vietnam. Nghi Son 2 uses large-scale Supercritical (SC) technology which is inferior to the current standard Ultra-supercritical (USC) technology, in violation of  international standards set out under the OECD Sector Understanding on Export Credits for Coal-Fired Electricity Generation Projects. There have also been concerns raised regarding the Environmental Impact Assessment associated with the project, such as the failure to consider alternative energy sources or conduct proper consultation with local communities, breaching international standards for the management of social and environmental risks under the Equator Principles.
In addition to coal-fired power, Mizuho’s policy strengthens its risk management towards the palm oil and timber sectors, which cause deforestation and forest degradation and are a major source of carbon emissions. However, Mizuho’s position of relying solely on certification systems for palm oil and timber is inadequate. Mizuho must also confirm how their clients are actually addressing deforestation and managing peatlands.
To achieve the Paris Agreement target to keep global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius, regulations on fossil fuels such as coal and tar sands are expected to become more stringent. In addition, efforts to protect forests, especially tropical rainforests, which play an important role in mitigating climate change, are essential. The need to take concrete measures to address climate change is also included under the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
We hope that Mizuho and the other two major financial groups in Japan, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, will promptly proceed with divesting from the coal sector, which carries  high environmental and economic risks.”
Note to the Editors:

Mizuho’s new policy on responsible financing announced on June 13, mentions “industries highly likely to have negative impact on the environment and society” including coal-fired power, weapons industry, palm oil, and wood products. https://www.mizuho-fg.co.jp/release/pdf/20180613release_jp.pdf
350.org Japan and supporting NGOs are currently running a global petition calling upon Japan’s three biggest financial institutions — Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Mizuho Financial Group, and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group — to: i) disclose financial exposure to carbon intensive industries in line with the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD); ii) outline business strategies and clear targets and metrics to align their finance policies with the Paris Agreement; iii) cease all new lending to coal fired power generation and coal extraction projects and companies involved in such projects.

",Bankrolling Abuse - Israeli Banks in West Bank Settlements,Bank Hapoalim ,Israel,i illegal settlements ,Construction | transport and infrastructure,Israel,"
Israel’s largest banks are providing services that help support, maintain, and expand unlawful settlements by financing their construction in the occupied West Bank, including partnering with developers to build homes on land unlawfully seized from Palestinians. The banks’ involvement is direct and substantial: they acquire a property interest in the development projects and shepherd them through to completion. The transfer by the occupier of members of its civilian population into the occupied territory, and the deportation or transfer of members of the population of the territory, are war crimes. The activities of banks finance a critical step in this transfer.
The 41-page report, “Bankrolling Abuse: Israeli Banks in West Bank Settlements,” details new research on the scope of banking activities in settlements and the violations to which these activities contribute. Israel’s seven largest banks provide services to settlements. The report also documents the involvement of most of them in building housing units that expand settlements by acquiring property rights in new construction projects and shepherding the projects through to completion. The transfer by the occupier of members of its civilian population into the occupied territory, and the deportation or transfer of members of the population of the territory, are war crimes. By facilitating expansion of settlements, these banking activities facilitate unlawful population transfers.
“Israeli banks are partnering with developers to build homes reserved exclusively for Israelis on Palestinian land,” said Sari Bashi, Israel and Palestine advocacy director at Human Rights Watch. “The projects these banks underwrite contribute to displacing Palestinians unlawfully.”
A map created by Human Rights Watch provides a partial picture of the financial services the banks provide throughout West Bank settlements. In addition to construction projects, banks provide loans to settlement regional and local authorities and mortgage loans to homebuyers in settlements and operate bank branches there. Palestinian West Bank residents, forbidden by military order to enter settlements except as laborers bearing special permits, cannot use these services. Palestinian and foreign banks provide services to Palestinian customers outside the settlements.
Settlements are unlawful under international humanitarian law. They contribute to a discriminatory regime in which Israeli authorities restrict and stunt Palestinian economic development, while subsidizing and supporting Israeli settlements built on land unlawfully seized from Palestinians. International humanitarian law forbids an occupying power from using land except for military purposes or to benefit the local population living under occupation.

Melbourne ",New research: Australian banks 2ºC scorecard 2018,ANZ ,Australia,,,,"
In December 2015 nearly 200 nations signed the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2°C, compared with pre-industrial levels.
Since then, the world has recorded its three hottest years. Half the Great Barrier Reef corals died in back-to-back mass bleaching events. Globally, several major cities are on the brink of running out of water. And the concentration of CO2 in our atmosphere has accelerated.
Australia’s ‘big four’ banks – ANZ, CommBank, NAB and Westpac – have all publicly championed the 2°C limit since Paris, promising to support the transition to a low carbon economy.
Yet three years on, the latest 2ºC Scorecard from Market Forces reveals they have together loaned $21 billion to the dirty coal, oil and gas sectors. Worse still, these loans include a 50% spike in new climate-wrecking fossil fuel projects that have no place in any serious plan to stay within 2°C.

Nijmegen, The Netherlands ",RBS moves on coal and tar sands and takes the lead of UK banks	,Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS)  ,United Kingdom,,,,"
RBS announced yesterday that it will stop financing new coal projects worldwide, as well as exploration and extraction projects in the tar sands sector. The bank will also stop lending to coal companies deriving more than 40% of their revenues from thermal coal or generating more than 40% of their electricity from coal .
Reacting to the updated RBS policies, Yann Louvel, climate campaigner of the commercial bank watchdog organisation BankTrack, said:


""It is good to see RBS finally adopt such exclusions for the coal sector and taking the lead among UK banks on coal. RBS is the first UK bank to adopt a full worldwide ban for the direct financing of new coal plants, contrary to HSBC which adopted in its updated policy last month exceptions for Vietnam, Indonesia and Bangladesh, three key coal growth countries, until 2023 . RBS is also the first bank in the UK to adopt a 40% threshold to exclude lending to some coal companies since no other UK bank has any exclusion threshold for coal utilities”.
“RBS could have gone further and adopt the 30% exclusion threshold used in the Global Coal Exit List for corporate finance, which many big investors have adopted so far such as Allianz or AXA . It is also worrying to see the new updated policies only apply to general lending to companies because most of big banks’ sector policies also cover underwriting deals since much of the financing to coal companies is raised through the issuance of new shares and bonds.”
“RBS has nonetheless far outstripped other UK banks in terms of coal exclusions. HSBC must now close its policy loophole and adopt a similar exclusion to stop financing new coal plants anywhere in the world. As the next UK bank to update its policy soon, Standard Chartered must also adopt such an exclusion with no exception and join the 16 international banks which have already done so, including now RBS . To answer the climate urgency and the health crisis linked to coal power, HSBC and Standard Chartered must also withdraw from their current involvement in six coal power dodgy deals in Vietnam and Indonesia”.
The RBS announcement captures in formal policy the decreasing trend observed in the bank financing figures to top coal companies published in the last Fossil Fuel Finance Report Card earlier this year, which went from  $504 million in 2015 to $172 million in 2016, and $0 in 2017 .
RBS also announced the end of its project financing to tar sands projects - but only for exploration and extraction projects, leaving out pipelines. This puts them on par with UK bank Standard Chartered, as well as Spanish bank BBVA and Dutch bank ABN Amro, but lagging behind seven other European banks that have adopted policies excluding direct financing for all tar sands projects .
BankTrack considers this broader exclusion of all tar sands dedicated financing as a bare minimum to adopt for banks, with exclusion of corporate finance for tar sands production and pipeline companies as a more ambitious but necessary further step. Given that RBS gave no money to top tar sands companies  in 2017, it should now take its policy even further to make clear to its customers that it is serious about its commitment to being a leader in sustainable financing, and to be an example of best practice in this area to other banks.

",Environmental NGOs respond to statement by Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group CEO on restricting coal-fired power financing,Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) ,Japan,,,,"
The following is a joint statement issued by a group of Environmental NGOs ー 350.org Japan, Japan Center for a Sustainable Environment and Society (JACSES), Greenpeace Japan, Rainforest Action Network, FOE Japan, Kikonetwork and ASEED Japan ー in response to a public statement made by Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc.(SMFG) President and Group CEO Takeshi Kunibe in an earnings briefing this week, stating that the company is reconsidering its policy on coal-fired power financing:
“We are following this development very closely and we hope that the statements coming from SMFG President Takeshi Kunibe translates into a meaningful policy in line with the Paris Agreement that ceases all new lending to coal fired power generation and coal extraction. Comments on coal-fired power financing have also been made by Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. Mizuho Financial Group has yet to make statements of the sort.
At the same briefing event, the SMFG President is quoted as stating that the company already makes its lending decisions on coal-fired power in line with OECD Guidelines and does not finance projects that carry ‘the risk of a significant negative impact’ on the environment. However, the three major Japanese financial groups have agreed to participate in financing the new polluting Nghi Son 2 coal power station in Vietnam, which is said to produce emissions that exceed international standards as set out under the OECD Sector Understanding on Export Credits for Coal-Fired Electricity Generation Projects.
International groups have signaled that this lending may also breach international commitments under the Equator Principles, a key agreement among banks to manage environmental and social risk. Other projects such as the Batang and Cirebon coal-fired power plants in Indonesia, recently funded by Japan’s financial institutions including SMFG have been associated with human rights violations and environmental damages reported by affected local people. Japan’s three major financial groups ー SMFG, MUFG, and Mizuho ー are also lending huge sums of money to power companies with plans to build 40 or so new coal-fired power stations within Japan.
In order to align its policies with the Paris Agreement, we believe that the responsible step for the three major Japanese financial groups including SMFG to take is to divest completely from financing new coal-fired power projects and companies involved in coal fired power internationally and domestically.
Led by banks in Europe, major international banks are starting to align their business strategies with the Paris Agreement and have published policies restricting finance towards the most carbon intensive industries, starting with coal. ING, BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank have committed to stop new finance for coal-fired power projects and restrict finance to coal-related companies.
In the global petition led by 350.org Japan and supporting groups, the three financial major groups including SMFG are requested to:
1. Disclose lending and investments in the most carbon-intensive sectors in line with the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations;
2. Publicize a business strategy and goals and metrics that are consistent with keeping global warming below 1.5-2℃;
3. Stop financing new coal-fired power plants and thermal coal mining projects and companies associated with new coal development to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.
We call upon Japan’s major financial groups starting with SMFG to swiftly adopt and announce a progressive finance policy on coal that adheres to the Paris Agreement.”

Texas, USA ",Chase AGM: Dozens of indigenous and frontline community representatives call for an end to bank financing of extreme fossil fuels,JPMorgan Chase ,United States,,,,"
PLANO, TEXAS, May 15, 2018 — The quickly growing international campaign pressuring JPMorgan Chase to end its massive funding of extreme fossil fuels continued to escalate today as a delegation representing Indigenous and nonindigenous communities from Canada to Ecuador and across the U.S. gathered at Chase’s annual shareholder meeting in Plano, Texas. The delegation represents the broad range of people suffering harm from the environmental, Indigenous rights and climate impacts connected to the bank’s financing of the most dangerous and polluting forms of fossil fuels.
Among major U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase is the biggest funder of extreme fossil fuels: tar sands, Arctic oil, ultra-deepwater oil, liquefied natural gas export, and coal mining and power. It is also a major funder of oil drilling in the Amazon rainforest.
An open letter penned by the delegation to shareholders, spotlights JPMorgan Chase in particular because of the unique scale and seriousness of the consequences stemming from its funding choices. “Jamie Dimon opens his most recent shareholder letter by boasting that JPMorgan Chase has ‘helped communities large and small.’ He omits mention of the other side of the balance sheet – the harm that his bank has done to communities like ours through its fossil fuel financing,” reads the delegation in the open letter.
Today’s protest comes just one week after a nationwide day of action saw hundreds of people engage in demonstrations at Chase branches in cities across the country, including New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland and Minneapolis. In downtown Seattle, 14 arrests were made after demonstrators staged a dramatic action that shut down the streets outside while others occupied Chase’s regional headquarters.
A briefing paper released recently by Rainforest Action Network (RAN) reveals that in spite of the urgent climate crisis and a public commitment to the Paris Agreement, JPMorgan Chase is doubling down on some of the most carbon-intensive, financially risky, and environmentally destructive fossil fuel sectors. According to the paper, which highlights data from Banking on Climate Change 2018, Chase is the biggest U.S. backslider, with extreme fossil fuel financing more than $4 billion higher in 2017 than 2016. For coal mining, the bank’s financing in 2017 was a startling 21 times higher than the previous year — this despite the bank’s policy to reduce its credit exposure to coal mining companies. And in the Amazon, a report from Amazon Watch shows that the bank invests heavily in companies with licenses to explore and/or drill in the Amazon rainforest on or near the territories of Indigenous nations that oppose oil extraction on their lands.
Delegates attending the AGM include Joye Braun of Indigenous Environmental Network, Tara Houska of Honor the Earth, Cherri Foytlin of Louisiana Rise, Cedar George-Parker of the Indigenous Youth Council, Bryan Parras of Sierra Club and Deyadira Arellano of the Texas Environmental Justice Advocacy Services (TEJAS), Jessica Lorena Rangel of Eyes of a Dreamer, Paul Corbit Brown of the Keeper of the Mountains Foundation, Yolonda Bluehorse and Frankie Orona of the Society of Native Nations, Manari Ushigua of the Sápara Nation in the Ecuadorian Amazon, Juan Mancias of the Carrizo/Comecrudo Tribe of Texas and Patrick McCully of Rainforest Action Network (RAN), Diana Best of Greenpeace USA and others.

",When the dam breaks: European Banks investing over €100 billion in dirty extractive companies.,,,,,,"
Minerals and metals are an integral part of our daily lives, from smartphones to toothpaste, but the global extractives industry is also heavily involved in some of the worst labour, environmental and human rights violations, particularly in countries of the South. The industry also has a substantial impact on climate change, particularly those companies involved in the extraction of coal, oil, or in risky practices such as Arctic drilling. In fact, just 7 of the 10 companies shown are responsible for almost 8% of global GHG emissions. The Dirty Profits 6 report released by Facing Finance highlights the investments of ten European banks in ten extractive companies which continually violate human rights and damage the environment.


The violations in this report by the ten extractive companies (including Barrick Gold, Grupo Mexico, Eni and Gazprom), variously cover contamination of land, water and air; silencing community activists using violence, threats and intimidation; labour violations and forced labour; and failure to provide the remedy communities deserve.


While banks increasingly claim to be improving their ESG policies, and that they pay attention to incidents and violations by companies, the report shows that almost a third of all capital provision (€32 billion) by the ten banks was to the very worst category of companies – those with poor human rights and environmental policies, a lack of commitment to international standards, severe violations and an unwillingness to engage on these issues. Over the seven-year period the two UK banks HSBC and Barclays provided nearly €9 billion to this category. The largest provision of capital to all the companies, was by BNP Paribas, Barclays and Credit Agricole, with DZ Bank and Rabobank providing the least.


“The Dirty Profits 6 report shows that most banks, particularly those that made the most capital available, are not taking strong enough action to ensure that the mining and extractive companies they invest in respect human rights and environmental concerns”, said Lesley Burdock of Facing Finance.


An example of one of the cases covered in the report is that of the company Samarco Mineração (jointly owned by Vale and BHP), responsible for the worst environmental catastrophe in Brazil when its tailings dam broke in 2015, killing 19 people, destroying entire villages and damaging around 2,200 hectares of land and 650 km of river. It has become increasingly clear that this was a preventable tragedy and that the tailings dam was poorly managed. Danilo Chammas of the International Network of People affected by Vale notes ""Besides being negligent in taking all necessary measures to avoid the dam's collapse, Samarco, Vale and BHP Billiton have also not taken the required responsibility with regard to reparatory measures for the victims. We have been following up on the company for many years, so for us this does not come as a surprise, given the company's bad record of human rights violations and damage to the environment, as well as its usual lack of ability to deal with those affected by its operations."" BNP Paribas and HSBC were two banks which provided direct capital totalling €537 million to Samarco Mineração in the years leading up to the incident.


These banks omitted to take action through their due diligence processes to ensure stronger standards of management and thus to prevent the tragedy. The companies Vale and BHP over the seven year period were also provided with capital of over €5 billion and €20 billion respectively - predominantly by HSBC and Barclays.


Facing Finance expects banks to take responsibility for human rights and environmental concerns in their decision making. In particular by improving transparency and making public all relevant information related to engagement; by defining the line between engagement and exclusion of companies; and by taking a proactive approach to identifying non-compliant companies. Facing Finance's Thomas Kuchenmeister comments; “Banks claim to use engagement with companies as a tool to identify and mitigate human rights violations and to validate their investments, but most banks provide no public information on this process. Without this information the public cannot know what banks have done to meet their ethical obligations.”

Poland ",Commerzbank tolerates financing of the coal energy sector in Poland,Commerzbank ,Germany,Ostroleka C coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Poland,"

CommerzBank is the main stockholder of the Polish bank mBank, which is financially involved in the biggest Polish coal companies, e.g. Enea, PGE and ZE PAK. 
Polish energy companies want to build more than 10GW of power plant capacity – 3.2GW is already under construction. Currently, the biggest planned power plant in Poland is Ostroleka C (1,000 MW) and one of its main investors is Enea. 
According to independent experts, during its expected 40-year operation, Ostroleka C may contribute to 2,000 premature deaths.  The investment will also have negative impacts on nature – its zone of influence will affect two Natura 2000 areas and indirect impacts will reach Puszcza Biala.  Further, according to two studies , the project is financially irrational and its cost has been grossly underestimated.  It is also facing major regulatory problems.
Meanwhile, other Polish power companies funded by mBank – PGE and ZE PAK – are also planning to build new open pits in Poland. These investments are proving to be very controversial and they face local inhabitants' protests. One of these projects, the Zloczew mine, is already well advanced.
CommerzBank, according to its policies, implements the strategy of sustainable development, taking into account the recommendations and resolutions of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Climate Accord. However, as a shareholder of mBank, CommerzBank still does not feel obliged to take responsibility for the actions of its Polish subsidiary, and by taking no action ensures that mBank continues to finance the Polish coal sector and associated infrastructure.
These are the main reasons why environmentalists are very concerned and took part in the General Assembly of Stockholders of CommerzBank (May 8) to call on the bank to improve its climate policies and to stop funding companies which plan new coal-based projects, also via its Polish subsidiary.
CommerzBank referred to trade secrets and did not respond to questions about coal investments. CommerzBank upheld last year's statement that mBank is considered to be an independent company that has autonomy in managing the bank. CommerzBank did not commit to any action aimed at influencing mBank to implement a carbon-free environmental strategy, but instead only to monitor the mBank case.
Radosław Gawlik, President of Ecological Association EKO-UNIA and anti-smog activist, commented: ""In the state with the highest level of air polution in the European Union, Polish society will be exposed to even more contamination. Unfortunately, some banks and financial institutions still co-fund or service the funding of such investments and mBank is one of them.""
Katarzyna Kubiczek, of Ecological Association EKO-UNIA, also pointed out: ""If CommerzBank wants to support pro-health and environment-friendly activities, it should consistently stop granting, also through their subsidiary, new loans to coal companies and should stop signing agreements concerning the issue of bonds by coal companies. It should also implement principles and requirements concerning environment and climate protection across its whole group. We hope that CommerzBank will not fund the Ostrołęka coal power plant in Poland, or Energa and Enea which have created this unwanted project.""

","AGM briefing: Switzerland's per capita financing of fossil fuels worst in Europe, thanks to Credit Suisse and UBS ",Credit Suisse ,Switzerland,Dakota Access Pipeline ,energy distribution | oil and gas,United States,"
Ahead of the AGMs of Credit Suisse (April 27) and UBS (May 3), Greenpeace and BankTrack have published a new briefing which shows the scale of the climate-busting energy lending by Switzerland’s two top banks. Combined, over the 2015-2017 period, Credit Suisse and UBS provided more finance for extreme fossil fuels on a per capita basis than their peers in any other European nation.
Based on the findings of the recently published Fossil Fuel Finance Report Card 2018, Credit Suisse  and UBS stand among Europe’s top ten heaviest financiers of extreme fossil fuels (in fourth and eighth place respectively), with total investments for 2015-2017 of $7.8 billion and $4.5 billion respectively.
Credit Suisse delivered a startling $1 billion increase in extreme fossil fuel financing between 2016 and 2017, driven particularly by its investments in companies involved in tar sands and coal mining – the two most contested fossil fuel sectors. The briefing describes Credit Suisse’s recent coal mining ‘spending spree’ in the US.
With its lending and bond underwriting, UBS meanwhile is seen to have outpaced Credit Suisse in its support for companies planning to develop new coal power plants. In the period 2014-2017, the bank arranged financing of $5.4 billion to coal plant developers.
For Credit Suisse and UBS to get their respective energy financing houses in order by the time of the UN climate summit in December this year, among the briefing’s recommendations for Swiss banks are:

Urgently come up with clear and timebound plans to make all of their finance flows consistent with the pathway of the Paris Agreement
End dedicated financing to new coal power plants worldwide.
End all financing to coal plant developers.
End all financing to companies and projects which violate FPIC and international indigenous rights conventions.
Phase out and exclude financing for companies with tar sands expansion plans or more than 30% of their business in tar sands (production, exploration, transportation), as well as finance for tar sands directly.

United States ",Atlantic Coast Pipeline Opponents Rally Outside Bank of America Shareholder Meeting in Charlotte,Bank of America ,United States,Atlantic Coast Pipeline ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,United States,"
Charlotte, NC A crowd of activists rallied today outside of a meeting of Bank of America’s shareholders and executives to call on the Charlotte-based bank to drop its financing of dirty and destructive fossil fuel projects.
Bank of America is one of the leading banks on a multibillion-dollar loan covering half the construction cost of Duke and Dominion’s proposed Atlantic Coast Pipeline (ACP),with Bank of America committing $225 million to the credit facility. ACP would run over 600 miles through West Virginia, Virginia, and North Carolina, slicing through pristine forests, scenic lands, and waterways. In addition to exacerbating climate change by leaking and burning methane, the pipeline’s construction threatens public health, air and water quality, and disproportionately affects low-income residents and communities of color.
Bank of America is also a key investor in the company behind the proposed Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP), which developers recently announced will extend into North Carolina. The crowd called on the bank to drop its funding for destructive pipelines like ACP and MVP and other dirty fossil fuel projects.
""The people of North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia have been asked over and over to sacrifice our safety, security, health, and economy for dangerous and unnecessary fossil fuel projects like the proposed Atlantic Coast Pipeline that boost the profits of polluting corporations while leaving us to bear the costs,"" said Sierra Club Organizing Representative Caroline Hansley. ""By funding the construction of the ACP, Bank of America is profiting off of the destruction of our communities. We'll be at their shareholder meeting to let them know that we won't back down until they pull their funding of this dirty, dangerous project.""
“My family has been farming this land for over 100 years and it’s shameful that polluting corporations can take control of it to line their pockets,” said Marvin Winstead, a farmer and impacted landowner along the ACP route. “The fracked gas Atlantic Coast Pipeline is dirty, dangerous and a threat to my life and livelihood.”
“We don't need a bridge fuel -- we're already on the other side,” said Dr. Sarah Taber, an industrial growth strategist based in Fayetteville, North Carolina who has written extensively on the economic viability of gas and the likelihood that ACP will turn into a stranded asset. “Large portions of the U.S. and China are replacing old coal plants with wind and solar, not gas. That's because even after expiring subsidies and adding energy storage, solar and wind are still the cheapest option. In recognition of the dismal financial outlook of the fossil fuel industry, investors have divested over six trillion dollars in the last five years from financial institutions, like Bank of America, that back fossil fuel investments.”

",Problematic Pipelines: Trans Mountain challenges go beyond B.C. government opposition,,,Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion project (TMEP) ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,Canada,"
Since Kinder Morgan Canada Limited acknowledged on April 8 that the Trans Mountain Expansion Project (TMEP) may be cancelled because of stakeholder objections, attention has focused on the need to overcome the difficulties posed to the project by the government of British Columbia by the May 31 deadline imposed by the company. However, the risks facing TMEP go beyond permitting difficulties in B.C. and are unlikely to be resolved by the end of May.
Greenpeace has published a new briefing outlining the intensifying opposition to (TMEP) from a diverse range of stakeholders including the B.C. government, the  Governor of Washington, First Nations, and Nestlé Waters Canada (Nestlé) which threatens to force the cancellation or delay of TMEP.
Institutional financiers may wish to ask Kinder Morgan whether adequate assurances can be obtained on all of these risks or whether the company should instead cancel TMEP.
Key risks facing TMEP which are examined in the attached briefing  include:
●   British Columbia’s proposal for restricting the transport of diluted bitumen
●   Possibility of restrictions on increased tanker traffic in Washington state
●   Nestlé’s opposition to the proposed pipeline route
●   Growing First Nations’ opposition and non-violent direct action, which is attracting mainstream media coverage
●   Pending litigation which will not be determined by May 31.
Download the investment briefing here.
Greenpeace USA, in partnership with Waterkeeper Alliance, also released a report earlier this week which details Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) and their subsidiaries’ track record of incidents during pipeline construction as well as spills from their existing pipeline network. The report finds that from 2002 to the end of 2017, ETP, Sunoco and their subsidiaries and joint ventures reported 527 hazardous liquids pipeline incidents to federal regulators - approximately averaging one incident from existing facilities every eleven days. These spills released a total of 87,273 barrels (3.6 million gallons) of hazardous liquids, including 66,515 barrels (2.8 million gallons) of crude oil. 67 of the hazardous liquid incidents were reported to have contaminated water, of which 18 incidents contaminated groundwater.

Nijmegen, the Netherlands ","HSBC moves on tar sands, but fails the coal test",HSBC ,United Kingdom,Long Phu I coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Vietnam,"
HSBC's new energy finance policy which has been published today sees the bank taking additional steps to align its energy financing with global climate change commitments.  The bank has pledged to no longer provide financial services for both offshore oil and gas projects in the Arctic and new tar sands projects.
HSBC has also pledged to end financing for new coal plant projects globally, but with the significant caveat that it may choose to finance such coal plant investments in Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam, up to the end of 2023.
Reacting to the new HSBC energy policy, Johan Frijns, director of the commercial bank watchdog organisation BankTrack, said: 
""HSBC's move to curb its financing for fossil fuels is hopefully a stepping stone on the way to the bank becoming a truly sustainable and environmentally conscious institution. However, the measures announced today on coal power financing should have seen HSBC going further to respond to the urgency of climate change. 
""It's disappointing that HSBC has chosen not to fully disengage from financing coal power plants in Indonesia, Vietnam and Bangladesh for the next five years. Any investment in coal power which the bank makes in the next five years in these countries will be condemning the citizens of these countries to huge health risks, and also undermining global efforts to stem climate change. HSBC could and should have chosen to get out of the financing of coal power plant projects fully, as 13 of its European banking peers have already done.
""For reasons which defy climate science, unfortunately it appears that HSBC is 'Happy Still Being in Coal'. Yet should HSBC support coal power plants in these countries proceed, they will have grim impacts for communities.""
Two prospective coal plant projects in Vietnam currently featuring HSBC involvement and interest to finance are Long Phu I and Vinh Tan 3, both of which are attracting major resistance from potentially affected communities.  HSBC is also currently financial adviser for two coal plants in Indonesia.
According to this year’s Fossil Fuel Report Card, published in March, HSBC’s financing of the largest coal power companies jumped by 79% between 2016 and 2017, and totalled USD 1.12 billion last year.

Brussels ",Apartheids Banks: Civil society groups demand accountability for apartheid profiteers,KBC ,Belgium,,,,"
New evidence shows that two European banks were at the centre of the apartheid era international arms money laundering machinery. For nearly two decades, Belgium’s Kredietbank and its subsidiary in Luxembourg (KBL) were responsible for facilitating up to 70% of all illegal arms transactions that allowed the apartheid government to secretly buy weapons despite mandatory UN arms sanctions. These and other banks have never been held accountable for what a leading international bribery expert describes as ‘one of the most important global money-laundering schemes ever.’
In the face of widespread impunity, can these financial giants be held to account?
Open Secrets in partnership with the Centre for Applied Legal Studies (CALS) are bringing the fight for accountability for South Africa’s historic economic crimes to Europe using international accountability frameworks. The complaint is against two major European banks - Belgium’s Kredietbank (now known as the KBC Group) and its subsidiary in Luxembourg (KBL) in terms of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.
The conduct of these banks exemplifies impunity amongst private actors who collaborated with the apartheid regime. It also shines a spotlight on similar contemporary practices involving major financial institutions that continue to undermine human rights across the globe.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) provides one of the few international mechanisms available to hold businesses accountable for their role in human rights abuses. The OECD has various contact points in member countries that are responsible for ensuring that multinational enterprises operating in their jurisdictions comply with the business operations and accountability standards set out in the OECD Guidelines. Open Secrets and CALS will be laying the OECD complaint at the banks’ doorstep by approaching the Belgium and Luxembourg National Contact Points.
As a courtesy both banks also be served a physical copy of the complaint.
Itinerary:
Representatives from both Open Secrets and CALS will be in Europe to launch the OECD complaint and hold media briefings on the following dates:
Tues 24 April: 12.30-14.00 Briefing: Heinrich Böll Stiftung - EU, 15 Rue d’Arlon, Brussels
Tues 24 April: 15:00 Delivery: KBC Bank, Havenlaan 2, Molenbreek Saint-Jean, Brussels
Thurs 26 April: 12.00 Delivery: Luxembourg OECD National Contact Point, 19-21 Boulevard Royal

",Bank of America leads finance for Atlantic Coast Pipeline,Bank of America ,United States,Atlantic Coast Pipeline ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,United States,"
As the sound of chainsaws shatters the peace along much of the 600-mile route of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline (ACP) in West Virginia, Virginia and North Carolina, Bank of America’s (BOA) shareholders and executives will meet in Charlotte, NC next week for the company’s annual general meeting (AGM).
Among the shareholders, few may be aware of the bank’s leading role in financing the disaster that is ACP. But impacted landowners and Indigenous community leaders from North Carolina will be there to set them straight, and expose the key role Bank of America is playing to ram the unwanted and unnecessary fracked gas pipeline through their communities.
The Atlantic Coast Pipeline is being constructed by Dominion Energy, Duke Energy and Southern Company, which have together formed a private company, Atlantic Coast Pipeline LLC, specifically to build and operate the pipeline. The pipeline will have a capacity of 1.5 billion cubic feet per day, enough fossil gas to generate over 67 million metric tons of climate pollution per year. Emissions equivalent to 20 average US coal plants. It will cut a swathe through the Allegheny mountains in West Virginia and Virginia and run along the length of the western edge of North Carolina’s coastal plain.
The pipeline’s route burdens some of North Carolina’s poorest communities including the native Lumbee population. In Virginia, one of the project’s massive compressor stations, an industrial complex generating noise, pollution and safety hazards 24/7, is proposed in the heart of a historic, rural African-American community. The litany of this project’s abuses and dangers is long. And those abuses and dangers now have a clear set of financiers, led by the nation’s largest commercial bank, Bank of America.
A credit agreement was signed in October, 2017 between Atlantic Coast Pipeline LLC and a consortium of banks to finance approximately 50 percent of the $6 billion+ construction costs. Duke Energy’s CEO discussed the loan with investors during an earnings call in November. But the details of the banks involved in the loan were only recently made available to us.
Bank of America, together with JPMorgan Chase, was a “Lead Arranger and Bookrunner” for the loan. This means BOA was key to the process of negotiating terms, assessing risk and arranging the participation of all the banks forming the syndicate for the loan. It also means that BOA is online for tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars in commitment to the loan. We do not know the precise figure, as few details of the loan have been disclosed.
Bank of America’s leading role in this loan adds to the Bank’s poor performance in screening out financial support for companies engaging in the production of so called ‘extreme’ fossil fuels, including coal, tar sands, and oil and gas produced in ultra-deepwater and Arctic environments. Rainforest Action Network recently published its annual Fossil Fuel Finance Report Card, which examines bank policies and financing for the worst fossil fuels driving the climate crisis. Bank of America received an average D Grade for its policies on the fossil fuel projects discussed in the report, and was estimated to have financed over $13.6 billion to these projects from 2015 through 2017. This financing did not include the loan to ACP LLC.
Bank of America has some positive climate goals, primarily a goal to finance $125 billion in loans for “low-carbon and sustainable business by 2025 to address climate change and other demands on natural resources”. But by only focusing on financing clean energy, BOA is neglecting a key piece of the climate change puzzle. It lacks coherent policies to restrict financing for the causes of climate change, fossil fuels including coal, oil and gas, and the infrastructure that facilitates the expansion of those fuels. The Atlantic Coast Pipeline will enable growth in Appalachian fracked gas and is associated with human rights abuses and environmental destruction.
The World Bank Group recently announced an end to upstream oil and gas financing by 2019. Other banks including ING and BNP Paribas are restricting financing for some of the worst fossil fuel projects. There is so much more the finance sector should be doing, and Bank of America is lagging behind some of its peers on this crucial sustainability issue that weighs so heavily on our planet’s future.
Bank of America needs to get out of the ACP loan and implement policies to restrict financing for oil and gas pipelines and fossil fuel production. Only then will it be a leader in addressing climate change.
More details on the ACP credit facility
The full list of banks participating in the loan to ACP LLC is in the table below. They include commercial banks that are the target of ongoing campaigns against pipeline finance, including Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase. Also of note is the participation of BB&T, another North Carolina-based bank. CoBank is a Colorado-based credit union focused on rural development, which is ironic given the burden rural communities and farmers face along the route of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline.

",Japanese banks betray their commitments and the environment by funding more dirty coal,Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) ,Japan,Nghi Son 2 coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Vietnam,"
Environmental organizations have condemned Japanese commercial banks for agreeing to finance the new polluting Nghi Son 2 coal power station in Vietnam, calling on the banks to act in accordance with the Equator Principles, a key agreement among banks to manage environmental and social risk and revoke the finance for the Nghi Son 2 coal-fired power plant.
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and Mizuho have reportedly signed loan agreements for the Nghi Son 2 coal power station in Vietnam.
Last month all three banks were made aware of numerous environmental and social risks that make Nghi Son 2 ineligible to receive finance from any bank that is a member of the Equator Principles. However, the banks ignored this advice and proceeded to finance the project, which would generate twice as much CO2 per every unit of power generated as the average generating plant in Vietnam.
“SMBC, MUFG and Mizuho seem to think that people in Vietnam don’t deserve clean air and power, but should get pollution and outdated technology. These double-standards are an insult to those of us who want the chance to develop cleanly and bypass the dirty energy blunders of the Western world”, said Hong Hoang, Executive Director of Vietnamese group CHANGE VN.
Another Equator Principles Financial Institution, Standard Chartered Bank, was a member of the Nghi Son 2 syndicate until last month but withdrew from the final deal.
“Standard Chartered acted appropriately upon learning that the Nghi Son 2 project failed to satisfy the Equator Principles, exiting from a project that it simply could not finance”, said Market Forces Executive director Julien Vincent.
“On the other hand, Japan’s major banks are making a mockery of the Equator Principles, which are supposed to steer banks away from projects where people, process and the environment are neglected. They should be ashamed of their actions”, said Mr Vincent.
“This decision by SMBC, MUFG and Mizuho to fund sub-critical coal plant development in Vietnam is totally at odds with meeting the 1.5-2C Paris Agreement goal and flies in the face of their commitment to disclose and manage climate risks through their endorsement of the recommendations outlined by the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures” said Shin Furuno, Japan Divestment Campaigner for 350.org Japan.
Breaches of the Equator Principles
Environmental groups have identified the following points that constitute breaches of the Equator Principles related to the Nghi Son 2 project:

No analysis of potential alternatives to the project: Equator Principle 2 clearly states that the alternatives to the project must be considered, “when combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 Emissions are expected to be more than 100,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent annually.” As far as is known, no such alternatives analysis was conducted, and if one was conducted, it was not made available.
Potentially non-compliant with Vietnamese law: Equator Principle 3 states that “the project must be compliant with relevant host country laws, regulations and permits that pertain to environmental and social issues.”  The project may not comply with Vietnamese law as the environmental impact assessment does not make it clear whether and how public consultation with the communities affected by the project took place.
Lack of stakeholder engagement: Equator Principle 5 requires ongoing stakeholder engagement. In addition to public consultation as required under Vietnamese law, it is unclear that the communities that are affected by the project are being consulted and engaged with on an ongoing basis regarding the terms of the project.  
Independent Review: Under Equator Principle 7, an Equator Principles Financial Institution is required to conduct an Independent Review of the assessment documentation.  It is unclear that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation or Mizuho completed such a review. If they had, it would be concerning that they would continue to finance the project without substantial changes to the technology used by the power project – given that it will would generate twice as much CO2 per every unit of power generated as the average generating plant in Vietnam.

Lack of information: Not allowing the project-affected communities access to information about potential impacts and alternatives to the project is contrary to Equator Principle 3, which clearly indicates that financial institutions cannot hide behind the regulatory frameworks in the countries in which they operate.  While Vietnam does not require environmental impact assessments to be publicly available, in “non-designated” countries such as Vietnam, the assessment process for project finance must comply with the International Finance Corporation’s Performance Standard 1, which requires that the project sponsor provide affected communities with access to relevant information on: “(iii) any risks to and potential impacts on such communities and relevant mitigation measures; (iv) the envisaged stakeholder engagement process…”  It is unclear that any of this information was provided to the project-affected communities.

Washington DC ",US Bank raises $2 billion in oil and gas pipeline finance since pledge to stop pipeline financing,U.S. Bancorp ,United States,Dakota Access Pipeline ,energy distribution | oil and gas,United States,"
Since revising its environmental policy last year, US Bank financed more than $2 billion to companies building oil and gas pipelines, including an estimated $480 million to Energy Transfer Partners, new analysis released today by Oil Change International concludes.
US Bank CEO Andrew Cecere won praise from indigenous rights and climate advocates in April 2017 when he announced to shareholders that US Bank would “not finance the construction of oil and gas pipelines.” Days later, US Bank issued a revised environmental policy significantly narrower in scope than what Cecere described, limited to only project financing which had never been a significant line of business for the bank.
Today, new research conducted by Oil Change International shows that since Cecere’s promise, US Bank financing activity with oil and gas pipeline builders has continued apace. The analysis comes days ahead of the US Bank annual shareholder meeting in Albuquerque, New Mexico where pipeline opponents plan to question executives about Cecere’s empty promise.
“US Bank says trust and ethics are its core values, but its actions seem to show the opposite” said Brant Olson, US program director for Oil Change International, “adopting a meaningless policy to create the impression of care for the environment paints a troubling picture of US Bank’s priorities.”
Today’s analysis finds that since announcing its commitment in April 2017:

US Bank has participated in dozens of deals with pipeline companies, worth over $40 billion, with US Bank’s estimated financial commitment totalling over $2 billion.
US Bank has served as a Bookrunner or Manager, meaning  it was a lead financial institution, on numerous pipeline deals totaling over $17 billion, of which US Bank raised over $930 million.

Of particular interest is financing for pipelines being built by Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), a company notorious for its role in building the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline. In addition to the Dakota Access Pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners is seeking to build numerous oil and gas pipelines throughout the United States which have been met with massive resistance as well as numerous construction mishaps, violations, and mandated work stoppages.
Today’s analysis finds that US Bank continues to finance ETP projects as follows:

US Bank raised an estimated $480 million for ETP in transactions worth $7.25 billion since April 2017.
US Bank underwrote two bond issues together worth $2.25 billion for Sunoco (a subsidiary of ETP), with US Bank directly responsible for over $280 million.
US Bank was a lender on two revolving credit facilities for ETP, responsible for an estimated $200 million of $5 billion in total credit.

The analysis, entitled “Empty Promise: US Bank Continues Pipeline Finance” was published by Oil Change International in partnership with Indigenous Environmental Network, Earthworks, Greenpeace, MN 350, and Rainforest Action Network. It can be found here:

Barcelona ",New worldwide armed banking database available,,,,,,"
The Banca Armada Campaign and Center Delàs de Estudios por la Paz, in collaboration with Don't Bank on the Bomb and with funding from the Ajuntament of Barcelona and Grassroots Foundation, ​​has published a new tool in which updated data is presented on the financing of the arms industry between 2011 and 2017, searchable by financial entities identified as Banca Armada from around the world. That is, the largest banks, insurance companies, file management companies, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and public institutions globally.
This recently published worldwide database is an original compilation of data on the financing of arms industry from more than 500 financial entities (banks, insurers, pension funds, etc.), with a total value of 508,482,640,468 US dollars. The new database accounts for nuclear weapons, cluster bombs, non-nuclear missiles, combat aircraft, warships, military explosives, military electronics, submarines, tanks, among others.
The search methodology allows selecting by financial institution, by country where the financial institution headquartered, and by arms company, and is available in English, Spanish and Catalan. It also includes graphical representations and rankings of armed banks by country and financial entity, together with a file by weapons company with key data on its sectors of activity. The search data can be downloaded in CSV and HTML format.
The Banca Armada concept refers to all financial entities that participate in the military industry through one or more types of financing, which are broken down in this database into three categories: underwriting of share and bond issuances of arms companies; the granting of loans to arms companies; ownership or management of shares and bonds of arms companies.
The objective of this new database is to provide the user with the possibility of deepening the analysis of the relationship between arms trade and financial institutions around the world, from a critical perspective based on a culture of peace.

Tokyo ",NGOs Sound the Alarm on Japanese Banks’ Continued Coal Financing,Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) ,Japan,,,,"
350.org Japan, joined by Rainforest Action Network (RAN) and Greenpeace Japan, drew attention to Japanese banks’ persistent coal financing through a series of announcements ahead of the Responsible Investor Asia 2018 (RI Asia 2018)  event. RI Asia 2018 brings together international investors, analysts, and other critical financial stakeholders in Tokyo to discuss sustainable finance. They cautioned that continued coal financing by the Japanese financial sector runs counter to the international trend within the industry toward decarbonization.
Mobilizing capital toward decarbonization is at the heart of the Paris Agreement, which commits governments to make “financial flows consistent with a pathway towards low-carbon, climate-resilient development.” In this shift, there is significant interest in the role of the financial services industry, which is a driving force of the modern economy. Banks have a critical role to play in the withdrawal of capital from carbon intensive industries through their financing decisions. Led by banks in Europe, major international banks are starting to restrict finance towards the most carbon intensive industries, starting with coal. Recognizing the risk of stranded assets, international banks are starting to align their business strategies in line with the Paris Agreement.
The NGOs issued a warning to Japanese banks and other financial institutions that failure to divest from coal could put Japan behind the curve vis-a-vis international peers. On March 28, Rainforest Action Network and other partners released the ninth annual “Banking on Climate Change: Fossil Fuel Finance Report Card 2018” which ranks bank policies and practices related to the financing of some of the most carbon-intensive, financially risky, and environmentally destructive fossil fuel sectors. The three major Japanese financial groups, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Mizuho Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, were among the lowest ranked for their financial policies pertaining to coal power and mining. Indeed, the Japanese banking sector continues to finance coal-related companies and projects heavily, and many projects linked to Japanese finance are causing serious environmental damage and human rights violations.
As Japanese financial institutions resist the global trend towards decarbonization, U.S. and European banks are becoming more forward-thinking in restricting finance for the fossil fuel industry, predominantly coal. Not only is this decision important from an environmental perspective, but the economic driver is becoming harder to ignore – given the long-term risk that tighter regulations on carbon emissions and falling prices for renewable energy will make such resources stranded assets. Coal has the highest carbon dioxide (CO2) output of all fossil fuels, and it is now becoming common sense for this resource to be first divestment target.
At today’s joint event, RAN presented a Japanese summary version of the “Banking on Climate Change 2018” report, targeting Japanese investors, banks and financial regulatory agencies. Hana Heineken, RAN Senior Campaigner on Responsible Finance, said, “While the response to climate change risk is accelerating around the world, the three megabanks in Japan are heading in the opposite direction by continuing their financing into fossil fuels and deforestation-related sectors. Banks are accountable for aligning their lending and investment policies with the Paris Agreement, and must end their financing of fossil fuels that pose the highest climate risk. As the largest shareholder of Japan’s three megabanks, Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund also bears responsibility. “
Martin Norman, Sustainable Finance Campaigner of Greenpeace Nordic and Marina Lou, Energy Finance Campaigner of Greenpeace International provided commentary around the briefing paper “Swimming against the tide: Japanese banks and climate change” that Greenpeace Japan announced today. They reported, “The three major Japanese banks have not announced plans to decarbonize their portfolio at all. They have become a minority amongst the financial institution of the OECD countries. This paper addresses the investors of the three Japanese major banks and raises the risks that they should consider when these banks continue to finance coal-fired power plants. Greenpeace will keep engaging both investors and Japanese financial institutions.”
350.org Japan indicated that in late April it would be starting a petition targeting Japan’s major banks to demand that they stop financing new coal developments. 350.org Japan Divestment Campaigner Shin Furuno stated, “We cannot construct any more new coal-fired power plants if we are to keep the world’s average temperature rise to less than 1.5-2 degrees Celsius as laid out in the Paris Agreement. Commercial banks have a responsibility to help sustain a habitable living environment for future generations. We will call on Japan’s major banks to implement responsible banking policies starting with concrete steps to stop financing new coal developments.”
At this year’s Responsible Investor Asia 2018, there will be panel discussion titled, “Collaboration on Climate Change and Adaptation towards a low carbon economy.” This exemplifies the critical nature of decarbonization in the financial services industry. The NGOs vowed that they will each continue efforts to get Japanese banks to take on banking policies in line with the Paris Agreement.

Nijmegen, the Netherlands ",Report finds major banks ramped up fossil fuel financing to $115 billion in 2017 ,Agricultural Bank of  ,China,Adani ,energy plants - coal | mining - coal  | oil and gas,India,"
A report released today by Rainforest Action Network, BankTrack, Indigenous Environmental Network, Oil Change International, Sierra Club, and Honor The Earth, endorsed by over 50 organisations around the world , reveals that in spite of the urgent climate crisis, 2017 was a year of backsliding by private banks. The report, 'Banking on Climate Change 2018', is the ninth annual report ranking bank policies and practices related to the financing of some of the most carbon-intensive, financially risky and environmentally destructive fossil fuel sectors. The report also details the negative impacts of these sectors on human rights, Indigenous rights and community health and well-being.

Download the full report, with bank grades and financing figures, here.


Tracking 36 of the world’s biggest banks, the report finds that the institutions funneled $115 billion into extreme fossil fuels in 2017, an increase of 11% from 2016. The single biggest driver of the increase in financing came from the tar sands sector, where financing grew by 111% from 2016 to 2017. The massive hike in bank support for tar sands to nearly $47 billion, led tar sands to overtake coal power as the most heavily funded extreme energy sector.


With some of the sharpest upticks in financing since 2016, Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto Dominion Bank, and JPMorgan Chase all passed the coal-heavy Chinese banks to become the biggest bankers of extreme fossil fuels last year. JPMorgan Chase increased funding to coal mining by a shocking 21 times and quadrupled its financing of tar sands oil.


The report finds that while some European banks have realised the risks and put policy restrictions on some of their fossil fuel financing, major players elsewhere have done little to adopt policies that would bring their activities in line with the Paris Agreement.


The case studies detailed in the report – from Enbridge’s proposed Line 3 tar sands pipeline in Minnesota, to the proposed Jordan Cove LNG export terminal and associated pipeline in Oregon, to the fleet of coal plants that Japanese company Marubeni is planning in Southeast Asia – all highlight that banks lack effective policies to prevent them from financing these highly polluting projects and companies.


The report focuses on financing for extreme fossil fuels, defined as: tar sands, Arctic, and ultra-deepwater oil; coal mining and coal-fired power; and liquefied natural gas (LNG) export in North America.

Statements:

Alison Kirsch, Climate and Energy Research Coordinator at Rainforest Action Network:


“At a time when some European banks like BNP Paribas and ING are adopting policies that sharply restrict their lending to some of the worst fossil fuels, US and Canadian banks like JPMorgan Chase and TD are moving backwards in lockstep with their wrongheaded political leaders. If we are to have any chance of halting catastrophic climate change, there must be an end of expansion and complete phaseout of these dangerous energy sources. Banks need to be accountable and implement policies guarding against extreme fossil fuel funding.”

Johan Frijns, Director of BankTrack:


“Despite the introduction of some restrictions in their coal financing policies over the last few years, the 14 European banks assessed in the Report Card managed in 2017 to collectively increase their financing by more than $2 billion for companies in the coal mining and coal power sectors. Europe's top banks have got to stop their coal-focused assault on the Paris Agreement, and it's now vital that they move to stamp out their financial support for companies developing new coal-fired power plants around the world. Just as the European bank AGM season gets under way, campaigners now have ample evidence to present to bank shareholders and decision-makers about exactly how deep the dirty energy financing still runs across the European banking sector, in spite of some new sustainability commitments and a blizzard of sustainability hype.”

Tom Goldtooth, Executive Director of Indigenous Environmental Network:


“Banks investing in fossil fuel development should be stripped of their social license to operate in our cities, states, provinces, tribal nations, and countries. These dirty investments are not only threatening the sacred integrity of Mother Earth, but are forcing Indigenous peoples into life or death scenarios with no adherence or accountability to human rights policies and/or Indigenous Rights protections. What is most distressing is a seemingly world-wide labeling of defenders of the environment and opposition to fossil fuel development as ‘terrorists’ much as was described in the report regarding Standing Rock Water Defenders. Not only in Honduras and Brazil, but in the Philippines even the UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples herself is on a government list of ‘terrorists’. By financing these unwanted and damaging projects, banks themselves are complicit in human rights abuses. As such, continued bank investment in fossil fuel development should only be seen as promotions of crimes against humanity and Mother Earth, and nothing less.”

Stephen Kretzmann, Executive Director of Oil Change International:


“Every single dollar that these banks provide for the expansion of the  fossil fuel industry is a dollar going to increase the climate crisis. The World Bank, which understands the deep threat that climate change poses to poverty alleviation,  has gotten the message and is ending its financing of upstream oil and gas projects. Meanwhile it seems some commercial banks appear intent on going in the opposite direction. It’s time banks like Chase and TD and US Bank took the World Bank’s lead and stop funding fossils. Until they do, these banks will be complicit in our climate catastrophe, plain and simple.”

Kelly Martin, Sierra Club Beyond Dirty Fuels Campaign Director: 


""The days of banks quietly funneling money into dirty, dangerous fossil fuel projects without the public taking notice are over. Tar sands and other fossil fuel projects threaten our climate, public health, and communities, and until they stop supporting them financially, banks like Chase and Wells Fargo are complicit in this destruction. There is a growing international movement calling on our financial institutions to do better, and we will not stop until they pull their support of dirty fossil fuels once and for all.""

Tara Houska, National Campaigns Director of Honor The Earth:


“Since the dog attacks and water cannons used on unarmed citizens at Standing Rock, indigenous people have been heavily engaged in divestment efforts around the world. These banks fund the projects that are killing the planet, destroying indigenous sacred sites, and violating the human rights of citizens. The financial industry is on notice – the human rights policies banks claim are in place must be enforced. Stop funding fossil fuels and move into a green economy.”  


Additional statements from endorsing organisations

Donna Lisenby, Clean & Safe Energy Campaign Manager, Waterkeeper Alliance:

""This report is an important tactical and strategic target list for activists worldwide. It not only has Waterkeeper Alliance's full endorsement but we intend to use it as an action plan.""

 
Hong Hoang, Executive Director of CHANGE:
“South-east Asia is now the final frontier for the coal industry, and many of the banks featured in this report continue to support coal power expansion in the region in spite of the huge impacts on public health and the climate. HSBC, Standard Chartered, Citi, DBS and several Japanese banks are lining up to finance various coal plant projects in Vietnam in the coming months. These banks have got to show some basic climate change common sense by cutting off, once and for all, this reckless coal financing, and by pulling out of these projects in Vietnam.”

 
Allie Rosenbluth, No Pipeline Organiser, Rogue Climate:

""This report further shows that the Jordan Cove LNG Export Terminal and Pacific Connector fracked gas pipeline, along with other new fossil fuel projects, is a bad investment. Our communities need good-paying jobs in improving energy efficiency and in the expanding clean energy industry, not new fossil fuel projects that hurt us all. Communities across the region will continue to ask Oregon's leaders to stand up against the Jordan Cove LNG proposal and for a just transition to clean energy.""

 
Osprey Orielle Lake, Executive Director of the Women's Earth & Climate Action Network (WECAN) International:  
""This report offers vital documentation to demonstrate the destructive role of financial institutions who are complicit in the violation of the rights of Indigenous Peoples, human rights, and Earth rights. Investing in dirty fossil fuels is an investment in climate chaos and against future generations.Women are building bridges across communities and across countries - committed to using our voices and actions to expose and oppose the abhorrent violations perpetuated by banks everyday that they choose to continue to finance fossil fuel extraction. It is far past time to transition to a clean energy future and care for our children’s future and Mother Earth.""

 
Chris Saltmarsh, Fossil Free Campaigns Coordinator, People & Planet:

“As fossil fuel divestment goes mainstream the industry driving climate injustice is at its weakest point in history, it is time to strip of them of the finance they need to continue operating. There can be no new fossil fuel infrastructure anywhere from Lancashire to La Guajira and everywhere in between. The People & Planet network will organise for institutional boycotts of Barclays until they show the progressive leadership they have historically avoided and ditch all fossil fuel finance.”

 
Diana Best, Senior Climate and Energy Campaigner at Greenpeace USA:

“At a time when the world must be moving rapidly away from fossil fuel expansion, we see major global banks like JPMorgan Chase doubling down on their support of extreme fossil fuels like tar sands. It is unacceptable.  It is time for these banks to put their money where their mouth is. Continued financing of fossil fuel projects and infrastructure like tar sands pipelines undermines any credibility they have as leaders on climate and human rights.”

 
Brett Fleishman, Finance Campaign Lead of 350.org:

“Major movement players are turning to focus on “the money” as there is a clear understanding that capital flow needs to shift quickly for any chance at a just transition off fossil fuels. Not a penny more! Fossil free finance! are becoming a primary part of the social movement outcry. It is clear, big banks are driving the economy in the wrong direction and it’s high time we hold them accountable.”

Nijmegen ",BankTrack publishes its 2017 Annual Report,,,,,,"
BankTrack, the tracking, campaigning and civil society support organisation focused on the impacts of private sector banks and their finance on people and planet, today releases its 2017 Annual Report.
The report sets out the organisation’s work over what it describes as a year of huge challenges and uncertainties, but also some great successes. Among the successes were:

Our ‘Equator Banks, Act!’ campaign met its immediate goal, spurring the announcement of a revision of the Equator Principles which will take place over the next 18 months,
Our human rights campaign efforts helped effectively challenge the Thun Group of banks' efforts to play down the sector’s human rights responsibilities,
Several banks, most notably ING and BNP Paribas, made significant moves to exit finance for parts of the fossil fuel sector, following sustained campaign pressure from us and our allies,
We published the online report “Banks vs the Paris Agreement”, featuring an interactive database on the financial links between private sector banks and the 120 companies responsible for planning and developing most new coal power plant capacity around the world.

The year also saw BankTrack hit for the first time with a lawsuit, from Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the Dakota Access Pipeline. The court is still considering our motion to dismiss the suit. 
BankTrack director Johan Frijns comments: ""This year, 2018, will be BankTrack’s fifteenth anniversary year, as well as marking the tenth anniversary of the global financial crisis. We have our work cut out for us, making good on the campaign successes of 2017, pushing for an Equator Principles revision that delivers for the climate and Indigenous people, holding banks to account for their responsibilities on human rights, and moving ever more of the world’s banks out of financing more and more sectors of the fossil fuels industry. And we will deal with the ETP lawsuit as it unfolds, but without allowing the matter to sidetrack us from our mission.”

Madrid ",European NGOs challenge Banco Santander climate policy at Annual Meeting,Banco Santander ,Spain,,,,"
The International Institute for Law and the Environment (IIDMA) today challenged the climate policy of Banco Santander at its annual shareholders meeting (AGM), in collaboration with BankTrack, ShareAction and the ""Development YES - Open-Pit Mines NO"" Foundation. In particular, the groups called for an end to the bank’s finance for projects and companies in the coal sector, both directly and through the Polish bank BZ WBK, in which Santander is the main shareholder.
Despite its recent efforts, Santander’s policy is still far behind most of its European competitors, including BNP Paribas, ING and BBVA. Last February, the latter published its Pledge 2025, with a commitment to divest from coal, including a general ban of direct financing to new mines and coal power plants worldwide. European NGOs have asked Santander to make a similar commitment, in line with the bank’s stated ambition to align with the Paris Agreement objectives to fight against climate change.
Last year, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, led by Michael Bloomberg, and the EU High Level Expert Group on Sustainable Finance, recommended the banking sector take steps towards greater transparency on its climate impacts. It is imperative for banks to support the transition towards a low-carbon economy and to apply rigorous climate-risk assessment i within their business strategies. In addition, they must provide detailed information to investors about their response to climate-related risks. .
In this context, European NGOs have questioned the alignment of Santander's policies - including its support for coal - with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, and have stressed the need for the bank to urgently ensure its financing policies are compatible with the Agreement’s objective of limiting global warming to below 1.5 degrees.. 
IIDMA has asked the following questions regarding its climate and energy policies:


Could Santander let us know whether it is planning on strengthening its climate change strategy and coal policy and if so, when it intends to publish it?




If not, could it elaborate on the reasons behind its coal policy allowing for financing new coal projects as well as coal power companies planning new capacity, despite intending to meet with the Paris Agreement objectives?


In addition, IIDMA highlighted that Santander is the main shareholder of the Polish bank BZ WBK, which finances companies whose main business is coal, most of which plan on opening new coal mines and coal plants in the country. Therefore, to be consistent with its fight against climate change, Banco Santander should apply rigorous climate risk assessment for all the corporate activities within its group:


What are Banco Santander’s plans regarding the support of its subsidiary BZ WBK to coal mines and plants?




Will Banco Santander pledge to underwriting no new bonds and provide no other form of financing to companies unless they renounce their coal mining and coal power expansion plans?




Will Banco Santander commit to providing no future loans for companies with more than 30% of their business in coal, companies whose annual coal production equals 20 million tons or whose installed coal-fired capacity equals 10,000 MW or more?


Quotes by the organisations
Carlota Ruiz-Bautista, lawyer at IIDMA, commented: ""According to the last UN Emissions Gap report, , there is no room for further high-carbon infrastructure lock-ins if we are to meet international emissions targets. Continuing to finance the construction of new projects in high-carbon sectors will contribute to the increase of global temperatures. Therefore, Banco Santander must include in its business strategy coherent commitments to be aligned with the Paris Agreement objectives, as BBVA has done. This includes providing no further financing to coal”.
Yann Louvel, climate campaigner at BankTrack, commented: “It took Santander two years to respond to the climate challenges set by the Paris Agreement, yet the new sector policies which the bank published last month are a major disappointment. If Santander wants to be taken seriously on climate, then it will have to urgently deal with the biggest loopholes in its policies. And, for starters, that means ending its direct financing for new coal mines and new coal plants worldwide, as well as for new oil projects in tar sands or in the Arctic, all measures which were adopted last month by its Spanish rival BBVA.”
Kuba Gogolewski, finance campaigner with Polish Foundation ""Development YES - Open-Pit Mines NO, commented: ""The times when Banco Santander’s Polish subsidiary BZ WBK could lend to Polish coal companies without anybody noticing are over. Lending to utilities planning new lignite open-pit mines and new coal power plants is clearly at odds with the Paris Agreement that Banco Santander wants to stay aligned with. The bank must commit to stopping all lending to new coal infrastructure and companies as defined by the Global Coal Exit List by COP24 in Poland or prepare to be the target of a public campaign in 2019.""
Sonia Hierzig, banking project manager at ShareAction, commented: “Santander and other large banks are increasingly facing shareholder scrutiny on the ways in which they manage climate-related risks and opportunities. Last year over 100 investors with combined assets under management of nearly USD 2 trillion wrote to 62 global banks to request better climate-related disclosures. This, as well as growing pressure from regulators and civil society, has led many European banks to take increasingly bold action on climate change. For example, fellow Spanish bank BBVA has recently published a new and comprehensive climate strategy, which restricts its financing of some of the most polluting industries. Shareholders will be keeping a close eye on whether Santander will be able to catch up with BBVA and other European peers.”
Reaction to Santander CEO answer at AGM
Banco Santander avoided any firm commitment towards the fight against climate change, announcing no changes on its coal policy, which continues to be ""confidential"" in terms of the exclusion thresholds applied for new coal plants. This represents an important problem as Santander could risk remaining with stranded assets. About its climate policy, Ana Patricia Botín, CEO of Banco Santander, stated : ""We have to bear in mind that not all countries progress at the same time. What is important is that they move in the same direction"". However, continuing to finance new coal plants and mines represents, under no condition, progress towards the right direction.

This report, produced by PAX a member of the Nobel Peace Prize winning International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear weapons (ICAN) is the only report detailing the global investments by financial institutions in companies producing nuclear weapons.
$525 Billion invested
329 investors made $525 Billion available to nuclear weapon producing companies between January 2014 and October 2017. They assisted with share and bond issuances, owned or managed shares and bonds or outstanding loans or made credit facilities. This is a decrease in the number of investors, but an $81 billion increase in the total amount invested. Find out who invests.
Most investors are from the US, and US$110 billion came from just 3 US financial institutions: Blackrock, Vanguard and Capital Group, all from the United States.
ICAN executive director Beatrice Fihn: “If you have been wondering who benefits from Donald Trump’s threats of nuclear war, this report has that answer. These are the companies that stand to profit from indiscriminate mass murder of civilians. We grow less safe while they cash in on chaos by banking on Armageddon.”
Positive examples

More and more financial institutions have policies in place to not invest in nuclear weapon producers. Those with the most comprehensive policies are listed in the Hall of Fame, while others with policies needing improvement can be found in the Runners-up.
In addition, Dutch pension fund ABP, the 5th largest pension fund in the world, announced in January 2018 that it will divest from all nuclear weapon producers. Norway’s Government Pension Fund, the second largest fund in the world, recently also announced the exclusion of more nuclear weapon producers.
Since the adoption of the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, 30 financial institutions have ceased investing in nuclear weapon producers.

There is a clear parallel with international developments regarding nuclear weapons. The small group of countries that have nuclear weapons are modernising and even expanding their arsenals. President Trump announced a new US nuclear policy earlier this year that lowers the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons, and president Putin announced only last week that Russia has tested new nuclear ballistic missiles.
At the same time, a large majority of countries around the world are calling for an end to this new nuclear arms race. Author of the report Susi Snyder: “The Nuclear Ban Treaty has sparked momentum towards divestment, shown by 10% fewer investors in nuclear weapon producers, and an increase in financial institutions comprehensively prohibiting any investment. Investments are not neutral, these companies should be congratulated for standing on the side of humanity.”

Paris ",New report: Société Générale – Foot on the gas for fossil fuels,BNP Paribas ,France,Rio Grande LNG Terminal ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,United States,"

In a report published today, Friends of the Earth France strongly criticises Société Générale’s support for the export of shale gas from the United States to Europe and Asia. The group is calling on the bank to withdraw from the controversial Rio Grande LNG (liquefied natural gas) project in Texas and to end its support for the most dangerous fossil fuels, as BNP Paribas has already committed to do.
The new report from Friends of the Earth France, 'Société Générale – Foot on the gas for fossil fuels', reveals the key role played by Société Générale in supporting the export of US shale gas to the European Union. In the US, the bank advises and funds the sector’s leading companies for development of their LNG export terminal projects. 
Among Société Générale’s customers are Cheniere Energy, which has already signed contracts with EDF and Engie to export LNG to France; as well as NextDecade, which the bank is advising for the construction of a liquefied shale gas export terminal, Rio Grande LNG, and a related  double pipeline for LNG, the Rio Bravo Pipeline. In 2017, NextDecade stated that Société Générale had been involved in all LNG terminal projects authorised in the United States, and no less than 45 such transactions internationally.
Lorette Philippot, Private Finance Campaigner at Friends of the Earth France, commented:
""By supporting these export projects, Société Générale is helping to bring shale gas into France, despite the fact that shale gas was banned in France seven years ago. This is completely hypocritical. If shale gas is banned in France, then it should not be arriving arrive by boat from the US with the complicity of a French bank. Building these terminals would lead to an increase in shale gas production, contrary to the climate imperative of leaving fossil fuels in the ground, and would have disastrous environmental and health impacts, which we have fought against here in France.""
Between 2014 and 2016, Société Générale has provided more than $2.4 billion to companies developing these projects in North America, thus making it the 7th ranked international bank and the number one French bank in terms of exposure to the sector, far ahead of other major French banks BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole and Natixis.
BNP Paribas previously had an advisory mandate for the Texas LNG shale gas export terminal project located a few hundred metres from the Rio Grande LNG site. However, in October 2017, BNP Paribas announced its withdrawal from the entire shale gas sector, a commitment which covers exploration and production as well as transport and LNG export. Last December, Société Générale announced only minimal measures regarding its financing of this sector, measures which campaign groups view as insufficient for reducing the climate, environmental and social impacts of this industry.
Lucie Pinson, Private Finance Campaigner at Friends of the Earth France, commented:
“The weakness of Société Générale’s commitment shows its total disregard for communities affected by shale gas projects and its denial of climate science. By putting an end to its support for new shale gas infrastructures and de facto withdrawing from the Texas LNG project, BNP Paribas has shattered Société Générale's pro-gas narrative. Société Générale is isolated and we will look closely at its decisions in the coming weeks. We will remain mobilised until it steps out from the Rio Grande LNG project and the entire sector, as BNP Paribas has done.”
As a result of Société Générale’s unwillingness to shift its policy on shale gas and LNG, campaign pressure against the bank is intensifying. This week in France, actions are planned around the country to call on the bank to finally align its financing practices with the increasingly urgent reality of climate change.

Jakarta ",Maybank: the single largest palm oil financier,HSBC ,United Kingdom,,,,"
Today, TuK INDONESIA and Profundo launched the report ‘Maybank: The Single Largest Palm Oil Financier’. The report finds that Maybank is the world’s single largest financier of the palm oil sector – it provided 11% of all loans and underwriting to 85 palm oil companies in the period 2010-2016. However, it has no publicly available risk policy for financing the sector. The bank has financial relationships with a large number of controversial palm oil companies that are involved in environmental, social and governance issues. This implication leaves Maybank exposed to significant financial and reputational risks.
 
Maybank’s top 5 palm oil clients active in Indonesia are all implicated in conflicts related to deforestation of High Conservation Value and High Carbon Stock areas, the development of peat areas, large fires in their concessions, conflicts with local communities over land grabbing, lack of Free, Prior and Informed (FPIC) consent, and bad labour conditions, including forced (child) labour. 
 
The development of palm oil has already destroyed millions of hectares of forest and peatland in Indonesia. This has caused large biodiversity loss and deprived many local communities of their customary land. Many plantations have been established on peat grounds; their drainage makes them highly inflammable, contributing to many fires, haze-related health issues and very high Green House Gas emissions.
 
Several large financiers have already adopted ESG policies to prevent them from engaging directly with controversial clients. However, the analysis in this report indicates that these financiers are still profiting from the controversial palm oil companies, namely by financing Maybank. At the same time, some of these financiers are Ordinary Members of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), and signatories of the UN-supported Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). This indirect involvement in controversial palm oil companies is not in accordance with the spirit of their commitments, and leaves them exposepald to reputational risk.
 
""To avoid further risks, Maybank should urgently develop a strong ESG policy and refrain from financing clients that do not comply with the minimum standards of such a policy. The bank’s financiers should support Maybank in the development of such a policy. Maybank should commit to a time-bound plan to do so. If Maybank fails to implement an adequate policy within the stated timeframe, its financiers should break ties with the bank”, said Edi Sutrisno, Deputy Director of TuK Indonesia.

Washington, D.C. ","In advance of TransCanada earnings call, Greenpeace and groups release Investor Briefing on Keystone XL obstacles",,,Keystone XL pipeline ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,United States,"
Today, Greenpeace USA, Greenpeace UK, and endorsing groups including BOLD Nebraska, Oil Change International (OCI), National Resources Defense Council (NRDC), and Rainforest Action Network (RAN) released an investor briefing on the current state of the Keystone XL pipeline project and the legal, regulatory, and political obstacles it continues to face to achieve completion. The briefing will be shared tomorrow with key lenders and thought-leaders who cover TransCanada and comes in advance of TransCanada’s 4th quarter earnings call to its investors the same day. The briefing includes a detailed analysis of the changes the Keystone XL pipeline project incurred during the last financial quarter, as well as a list of critical questions institutional investors may wish to ask to help determine the project’s commercial viability.
Among the major risks to the Keystone XL project included in the briefing are:


The legal challenge to the validity of the Nebraska Professional Services Council (PSC) decision approving the alternate route for the pipeline;




The 2014 federal Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (FSEIS) that does not cover the project’s new approved route;




The more than 100 landowners in Nebraska who refuse to sign over their land for the new route; and




The escalating Indigenous and landowner opposition to the pipeline, including its threat to drinking water.


The briefing can be downloaded here.
TransCanada has yet to make its final investment decision on Keystone XL, a project which continues to face legal and regulatory challenges. The pipeline company had estimated that it would make its determination last December, but has since indicated that it could make the announcement by the end of the first quarter 2018 (March 31).    
In October 2017, Greenpeace and OCI released an in-depth report that outlined the financial and reputational risks related to three tar sands pipelines, including Keystone XL.

","Open letter calling on DBS, OCBC and UOB to take action on climate change",DBS ,Singapore,,,,"
We, the undersigned organisations, representing approximately 896,341 people, are deeply concerned about the environmental and social impacts of a growing fossil fuel-based energy system.
Globally, a growing number of financial institutions are taking action to support the goal of the Paris climate change agreement by implementing policy that restricts and excludes lending to highly carbon-intensive sectors such as coal.
Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has termed climate change a ‘huge’ financial risk and in 2017 announced that the Bank of England will probe banks’ exposure to climate risk. However, Singaporean banks are falling critically behind, not only failing to deliver policy and practical responses to climate change, but instead becoming an increasing part of the problem through the continued multi-billion dollar financing of coal-fired power stations and related infrastructure.
Singaporean banks have also been implicated in a number of controversial deals for coal-fired power stations in Southeast Asia, which would lock in decades of pollution. World Bank president, Jim Yong Kim, has warned that plans to build more coal-fired power plants in Asia would be a “disaster for the planet” and overwhelm the deal forged at Paris to fight climate change.
Other impacts of coal such as air pollution are creating major environmental and health risks for the people of South East Asia. A study published by researchers at Harvard University in 2017 estimates that by 2030 coal pollution alone will contribute to 19,220 deaths annually in Vietnam and 24,400 in Indonesia. New coal-fired power stations are particularly unacceptable given the potential for clean renewable energy to meet projected energy demands.
In stark comparison to the Singaporean banks, 14 banks globally have ended direct financing of new coal plants worldwide, including BNP Paribas, ABN AMRO and Deutsche Bank. Moreover, unlike 92 of their global peers from 37 countries, no Singaporean bank has adopted the Equator Principles, which provide a minimum standard for due diligence in financing projects such as coal power plants.
As you will be aware, the Singaporean Government has declared 2018 to be the Year of Climate Action. We are calling on Singapore’s banks to help make this a reality. As a starting point, Singapore’s major banks should recognise that holding global warming below 2˚C requires halting the expansion of the fossil fuel sector, and following the lead of their European and North American counterparts by excluding all forms of support for new coal power plants.

Melbourne ",Singaporean banks blowing smoke on climate,DBS ,Singapore,Nam Dinh coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Vietnam,"
A new analysis from environmental finance group Market Forces shines a light for the first time on Singaporean banks’ continued funding of the coal industry, despite public pronouncements on climate action.
Market Forces analysed data relating to the lending activity of Singapore’s big three banks, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC), DBS Bank and United Overseas Bank (UOB), to coal companies and projects since 2012.
The analysis revealed OCBC as Singapore’s dirtiest bank, having participated in 14 deals to the coal sector worth a total of US$1,142 million. DBS Bank participated in 12 deals worth $885m, while the smallest lender was United Overseas Bank, which participated in five deals worth $262m.
“Banks have a pivotal role to play in determining our energy mix, but despite global investment in new renewable energy outstripping fossil fuels, Singaporean banks remain heavily skewed in favour of polluting power,” said Market Forces Executive Director Julien Vincent.
“Whilst the Singaporean Government has declared 2018 the ‘year of climate action,’ the country’s banks appear to be stuck in the last century in terms of their lending practices.”
“If the world is to meet the agreed goal of keeping global warming to less than 2˚C, 80% of existing fossil fuel reserves cannot be burned. Financing new coal-fired power stations is simply off the cards.”
Worryingly, the lending pattern is showing no sign of abating. DBS has been named as part of a syndicate in four 1200MW coal-fired power plants in Vietnam – Nam Dinh 1, Nghi Son 2, Vinh Tan 4 and Vung Ang 2 and is also a financial adviser for a number of planned coal-fired plants in Indonesia including the Jawa-6 (2000MW), Jawa-9 (600MW) and Jawa-10 (660MW) plants.
Despite this, in November 2017, Mike Power, Chief Operating Officer for Technology and Operations, DBS Bank stated that “climate change is among the most pressing challenges of our time, and one that needs to be tackled urgently if we are to preserve the habitability of our planet.”
“For DBS to acknowledge the severe risks that climate change poses to humanity, while continuing to fund new coal projects that threaten our ability to even contain those risks is an act of breathtaking hypocrisy,” said Vincent.
Remarkably, none of Singapore’s big three even have a climate policy in place, let alone a commitment to restrict lending to the biggest sources of greenhouse pollution.
Fourteen major commercial banks from the US and Europe have adopted policies that end direct financing of coal power plants. No Asian bank has so far produced such a policy.
“If Singapore’s banks want to see themselves as leaders on climate change, they can start acting as leaders. At the moment, OCBC, DBS and UOB are well behind their global competitors on policy action to restrict fossil fuels and boost renewables. 2018 needs to be the year in which they catch up,” said Vincent.

San Francisco ",JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo Double Down on Support for Dirty Tar Sands Pipelines,JPMorgan Chase ,United States,Keystone XL pipeline ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,United States,"
Despite mounting public opposition from a broad coalition of Indigenous and environmental groups, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo renewed their participation in a set of loans totaling $1.5 billion to TransCanada, the company behind the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline .
The banks have faced significant pressure in recent months to divest from the controversial pipeline, which would transport dirty, climate-polluting tar sands through the Midwest to the Gulf Coast for export, threatening Indigenous rights, land, water, and communities along the way.
Sierra Club Beyond Dirty Fuels Campaign Director Kelly Martin said:
“Wells Fargo’s PR team loves to tout the bank’s commitment to responsible investing and transitioning to clean energy, but today’s decision makes it clear that it’s all talk. Keystone XL would be a disaster for our communities and our climate, and any bank that’s helping fund this terrible project and others like it is on the wrong side of history. The growing movement working to hold banks like Wells Fargo accountable for their reckless investments is not going anywhere. It will only grow louder and stronger until our financial institutions commit to investing in a future that benefits our communities, our economies, our health, and our planet.”
Rainforest Action Network Senior Climate and Energy Campaigner Ruth Breech said:
“Wall Street is failing the climate test and violating the free, prior and informed consent of Indigenous people. JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo had an opportunity to cut ties with TransCanada and the KXL pipeline and they chose to walk on the wrong side of history. This goes to show that JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo could care less about devastating the lives of real people caused by the environmental destruction and climate disaster wrought by tar sands.”
Indigenous Environmental Network campaigner, Dallas Goldtooth, said:
“This is deplorable. JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo have chosen to double down on the plunder of Indigenous lands, to condone violence perpetrated against peaceful water protectors and to further the trampling of Indigenous rights to Free, Prior and Informed Consent. Furthermore, Wells Fargo just announced $50 million worth in grants to Native Americans while dumping billions into tar sands oil development, diminishing the lives of Native Americans at the source. The irony and contradictions cannot and will not go unnoticed. We must stop tar sands and keep fossil fuels in the ground!”
Greenpeace USA Senior Climate and Energy Campaigner Diana Best said:
“Greenpeace is deeply disappointed that JPMorgan Chase and other banks continue to fund companies trying to build dirty tar sands pipelines -- projects that jeopardize human rights, drinking water, and our climate. These banks are on the wrong side of history. Hundreds of thousands of people are stepping up to oppose these pipelines and the financial lenders bankrolling these projects. Other banks have announced moves to step away from tar sands this year, yet JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo continue to fall behind the curve.”
Northern Plains Resource Council, former Chair and farmer, Dena Hoff said:
""This is about protecting water -- when you think about how critical water is to Montana's economy, you have to ask why banks are supporting projects as dirty as the Keystone XL pipeline. Over the long haul, it just doesn't make good sense. Keystone XL would go under the Yellowstone River about 13 miles upstream from my farm. I've already dealt with one major oil spill in the river near my property, and I never want to see that again. I want my children and my grandchildren and their children to keep coming to this farm. But without clean water, our farm couldn't operate. Without clean water we have nothing.""

",Investing in a Green Belt and Road? Assessing the Implementation of China’s Green Credit Guidelines Abroad,Agricultural Bank of  ,China,Lamu coal power project ,energy plants - coal,Kenya,"
Download report 
In 2012, China’s Green Credit Guidelines (GCG) set a precedent in the world of sustainable finance by obligating banks to comply with host country law and international norms in their overseas lending. Five years since its publication, the GCG still stand as one of the most progressive sustainable finance policies in the world. However, implementation remains a key challenge.
In 2013, China announced the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a national strategy calling on Chinese industries to invest in economic corridors from China to Southeast Asia, Africa, Central Asia, and Europe. It will involve more than 60 countries, which is roughly 60 per cent of the world’s population, and may cost nearly 5 trillion USD. These Chinese overseas investments will span across a variety of sectors, including shipping, mining, energy, and infrastructure.  The BRI is a major underpinning of China’s economic reform. According to the Chinese government, it is intended to promote development in not only China but around the world. As a result, this second wave of Chinese industries expanding and shifting overseas may indeed lead to increased economic opportunities, but it may also trigger a surge of harmful environmental, social, and climate impacts.
The BRI will be financed by a variety of Chinese, host country, and international institutions, but Chinese banks in particular will play a major role as the financial backbone of the initiative. This also means that Chinese banks are well placed to play a proactive role in helping to keep clients accountable to projects’ environmental, social, and climate impacts.
Promisingly, in 2014, Chinese bank regulators published key performance indicators (KPI) to help banks monitor and measure their implementation of the Green Credit Guidelines. These KPIs provided needed guidance as to how banks should categorize risky projects, when banks should suspend financing, and which international norms and standards should be observed in overseas projects, among other important metrics. Currently, however, banks are only required to assess their level of green credit implementation on an institutional and not project level. Moreover, the BRI further highlights the need for Chinese banks to monitor and measure their environmental and social performance in overseas investments, as required by Chinese banking regulators.
The Report
Friends of the Earth US’s December 2017 report, “Investing in a Green Belt and Road? Assessing the Implementation of China’s Green Credit Guidelines Abroad,” examines Chinese financed projects based on official key performance indicators published by Chinese bank regulators. This report includes the seven following case studies:

APRIL Pulp and Paper Mills, Indonesia
Hambantota Port, Sri Lanka
Jakarta-Bandung High Speed Rail Project, Indonesia
Lamu Coal Power Plant, Kenya
Mes Aynak Copper Mine, Afghanistan
Sasan Ultra Mega Coal Plant, India
Yamal Liquefied Natural Gas Project, Russia

The Green Credit Guidelines offer China and its banking sector a unique opportunity to make good on their commitment to invest sustainably. But according to our report findings, Chinese banks continue to struggle to meet their obligations to comply with host country law and international norms and standards in their overseas investments.
Key Findings

Similar to the findings of a 2014 study published by Friends of the Earth US, Chinese banks still struggle to comply with host country laws and regulations, let alone international norms and standards. Of particular concern are international norms related to banks requiring high quality environmental and social impact assessments from their clients, in addition to ensuring that public consultations are conducted based on Free, Prior and Informed Consent.
Chinese banks continue to have weak channels of communication and engagement with the public and local stakeholders, which significantly undermines the implementation of the Green Credit Guidelines.
The China Banking Regulatory Commission’s publication of the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) is a positive first step in promoting better implementation of the GCGs; however, some KPIs remain under-developed in regards to advancing the spirit and objectives of the GCG, particularly those relating to international practices and norms, and resolving local conflicts.
As currently written, the KPIs miss an opportunity to serve as a valuable tool in the global fight against climate change. They should promote one of the international banking sector’s leading climate-related financing norms: curbing coal sector financing.
Better bank-level and project-level disclosure, including requiring that banks publicly disclose their KPI self-assessments, would promote stronger implementation of the GCGs and thus better environmental and social risk management.
Chinese banks should better use the GCG as a means to screen and assess how environmental and social risks may in fact undermine the financial viability and feasibility of projects, especially in the infrastructure sector.

Paris ",AXA Sets Milestone for Fossil Fuel Divestment,,,,,,"
Friends of the Earth (France) and Urgewald (Germany) applaud the major new divestment steps taken by French insurer AXA, the world’s 3rd largest insurance company. After a first reduction of its coal investments in 2015, AXA’s CEO Thomas Buberl announced at today’s “One Planet Summit” in Paris that AXA will divest an additional EUR 2.4 billion in coal assets and EUR 700 million in tar sands assets.

 

“AXA is going far beyond what other global investors such as the Norwegian Government Pension Fund and Allianz have done,” says Heffa Schuecking, director of Urgewald. According to its new policy, the insurer will not only drop companies which derive over 30% of their power or revenues from coal. It will also divest the largest coal producers (> 20 million tons per year) and all companies planning to build over 3,000 MW of new coal-fired capacity. “The fact that AXA is willing to also divest huge and diversified companies like Marubeni or Glencore makes it a true climate leader. These companies are found in almost every major investment portfolio, in spite of the fact that Marubeni is one of the world’s largest coal plant developers and Glencore is the world’s 8th largest coal producer,” explains Schuecking.

 
In its statement AXA confirms that it is using the “Global Coal Exit List” to guide its coal divestment efforts. The Global Coal Exit List was developed by Urgewald and is the first database that provides a comprehensive overview of the coal industry and reveals which companies are planning new coal power stations and coal mines. 


Yesterday, a coalition of NGOs published the report “Investors vs. the Paris Agreement”, which shows that AXA is currently the 32nd largest investor in companies developing new coal plants, behind investors like Blackrock (no. 1) and AXA’s biggest competitor Allianz (no. 23). The world’s top 120 coal plant developers aim to build 550,000 MW of new coal capacity, which would put the Paris climate goals out of reach. “AXA’s new forward-looking divestment approach is a paradigm shift and means it will now drop many of these top coal plant developers from its portfolio. AXA’s commitment is not perfect  but it is still a huge step towards impact divesting and should be followed by other investors and banks,” says Lucie Pinson, finance campaigner from Friends of the Earth France.

 

AXA has also committed itself to applying the same forward-looking approach to the incredibly destructive tar sands industry. “And what is more, AXA is putting an end to underwriting of new coal and tar sands projects as well as the accompanying infrastructure such as pipelines, thus setting an example for the entire insurance industry. Today is a celebratory day for the climate and the frontline communities threatened and impacted by the coal and tar sands industries,” says Pinson.

Paris ",Banks and investors jeopardising the Paris climate goals,,,,,,"

On the eve of the Paris Agreement’s second birthday, two new reports reveal how large banks and investors are actively undermining the Paris climate goals. The reports provide data exposing how, between January 2014 and September 2017, big banks provided US$630 billion in financing to the 120 top coal plant developers, and major institutional investors are currently investing close to US$140 billion in the same companies.


“While climate scientists warn that we need to accelerate the phase-out of existing coal plants, banks and investors are still channeling billions of dollars to companies planning new coal power stations,” says Heffa Schuecking, director of Urgewald.


The complementary reports, ‘Banks vs. the Paris Agreement’ and ‘Investors vs. the Paris Agreement’ were launched by BankTrack, Urgewald, Friends of the Earth France, Re:Common and Rainforest Action Network at the Climate Finance Day in Paris. The reports examine banks’ and investors’ involvement with the world’s top 120 coal plant developers. These companies are responsible for 2/3 of the new coal-fired power stations planned around the globe and aim to build over 550,000 megawatts – an amount equal to the combined coal fleets of India, the United States and Germany.

Banks vs. the Paris Agreement


Bank financing of these companies in the period from January 2014 to September 2017 involved US$630 billion in lending and underwriting, with Chinese and Japanese banks responsible for 68% of the total. In the two years since the Paris Agreement was signed, banks have provided US$275 billion to the top 120 coal plant developers.


17 of the top 20 underwriters for bond and share issues of coal plant developers are Chinese banks, led by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China which provided over US$33 billion to coal plant developers through underwriting.


“We have seen China take important steps to begin reducing its domestic coal use. It now needs to rein in the money going to Chinese coal expansion overseas. If China wants to have a claim to climate leadership, it needs to stop the huge financial flows from its banks to coal plant developers,” says Yann Louvel, Climate and Energy Campaign Coordinator at BankTrack.


For lending the picture is quite different. The top two lenders to coal plant developers are the Japanese banks Mizuho Financial and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial with US$11.5 billion and US$10.2 billion respectively.


Shin Furuno, divestment campaigner from 350.org Japan says, “Mizuho Financial Group, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation have provided US$25.3 billion to companies whose coal power plans threaten to put the 2°C goal out of reach. Japanese banks need to finally commit to lending policies that are in line with the Paris Agreement.”


While an increasing number of Western banks have adopted policies to restrict direct financing of coal power projects, their financing of coal plant developer companies still continues. Almost half of the top 20 lenders to coal plant developers are Western banks, such as ING, Citi, Societe Generale, HSBC and Deutsche Bank. HSBC and Citi are also among the top 20 underwriters of coal plant developers. HSBC announced during the recent UN climate summit in Bonn that it would continue lending to coal power projects in developing countries, which is where 90% of new coal plants are planned. In 2016, the year after the signing of the Paris Agreement, nine large Western banks actually increased their financing for top coal plant developers. 


Yann Louvel from BankTrack comments: “In spite of banks’ policies, the financing tap for companies aiming to build hundreds of new coal plants still remains very much open.Banks need to close that tap and start saying ‘No’ to coal plant developers”.


The report ‘Banks vs. the Paris Agreement’ is available at: www.banktrack.org/coaldevelopers

Investors vs. the Paris Agreement


The report “Investors vs the Paris Agreement” identified 1,455 institutional investors with overall investments of almost US$140 billion in the top 120 coal plant developers. “Our research investigated the portfolios of pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds, asset managers, sovereign wealth funds and the asset management arms of commercial banks. Data availability, however, was a real problem as many pension funds do not report on their holdings. The US$ 139.6 billion of institutional investments we identified in coal plant developers are likely only the tip of the iceberg,” explains Schuecking.


The world’s largest investor in coal plant developers is the US-based investment giant BlackRock, which holds shares and bonds worth US$11.5 billion in these companies. It is followed by Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund with investments of US$7 billion and US investment manager Vanguard, which holds investments of US$5.7 billion in coal power expansion companies.


“For BlackRock, its investments in coal plant developers are only a tiny part or its portfolio, less than 0.2% of its managed assets. For the rest of us, these investments are a giant step towards a de-stabilized climate and a 4°C world,” says Schuecking. The 52 coal plant developers in which BlackRock in many cases holds significant stakes collectively account for coal power expansion plans of 340,622 MW – this is equal to the combined coal fleets of India, Japan, South Korea and Russia.


All in all, investors from the US account for 37% of the institutional investments in coal plant developers. Next in line are EU and Japanese investors (13% each), Malaysian investors (9%), Chinese Investors (7%) and Indian investors (6%).


“Many of the top investors in our ranking are members of the ‘Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change’ or similar initiatives that regularly issue warnings about the threat climate change poses to our economy and societies. These are, however, the very same institutions that invest billions of dollars in companies with enormous coal power expansion plans. It is time that BlackRock, Vanguard and other global investors acknowledge the inconvenient truth that their own investments are accelerating climate change,” concludes Schuecking.

The reports were published to coincide with Climate Finance Day in Paris, which is meant to kick-start a global climate ‘stocktake’ process for the next UN climate summit in Katowice, Poland in December 2018.


NGOs from around the world are calling on banks and investors to take steps to exclude the top 120 coal plant developers from their portfolios by the time of the climate summit in Katowice in December 2018.

Nijmegen ",New Briefing Paper: How banks contribute to human rights violations,,,,,,"
A new BankTrack briefing paper sets out eight recent examples of cases in which banks may have contributed to human rights abuses through their finance, following recent UN guidance to banks on their responsibilities under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The paper, published to mark Human Rights Day on Sunday 10th December, calls on banks to acknowledge that they can contribute to such abuses through the provision of finance, and develop policies and practices to ensure they can play a role in remedying these impacts, including establishing effective complaints mechanisms for those affected.
Following a controversial January 2017 Discussion Paper signed by eleven banks under the name of the Thun Group, banks claimed that contribution to human rights harm is “rare when providing financial products & services”. Businesses including banks have a responsibility to remediate impacts where they have contributed to them, and the lack of recognition by banks that they can contribute to such impacts through their finance is likely to hinder progress towards banks meeting this responsibility.
BankTrack is campaigning for all banks to fully meet their responsibilities under the UN Guiding Principles. While many banks have developed human rights policies that recognize these Principles since they came into force in 2011, their attention to remediation of impacts is lacking, as BankTrack’s earlier research has shown.   
The eight cases profiled in the report include finance human rights impacts resulting from specific projects, as well as sector and country-level impacts. The cases are:

the Dakota Access Pipeline in the United States,
the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion Project in Canada,
the Agua Zarca hydroelectric project in Honduras,
the Phnom Penh Sugar Company in Cambodia,
Drummond and paramilitary violence in Colombia,
finance for cluster munitions internationally,
bank support for illegal settlements in the Palestinian occupied territories, and
the secret loans that led to the current economic crisis in Mozambique.

The paper points to a need for banks to take action wherever possible to participate in remedying the adverse human rights impacts in these cases, and to be guided by independent expertise where there are questions about the most appropriate role they can play in remediation.
The paper can be downloaded here.
BankTrack welcomes responses from banks and others on the cases covered in this briefing and the analysis of the relationship of the bank to the impact in each case, as well as on the appropriate role for banks in providing remediation in these cases. We look forward to further multi-stakeholder discussions on the role banks can play in remedying human rights impacts to which they contribute and on how they can promote access to remedy for affected people.
Update: The Business & Human Rights Resource Centre has sought responses from many of the banks and companies mentioned in the above paper. These responses are available on the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre website, here. BankTrack has also compiled these responses in one document for reference, here.

",Chinese banks rule out Carmichael coal mine!,Bank of  ,China,Carmichael coal mine project ,mining - coal  | transport and infrastructure,Australia,"
Three Chinese banks in five days have moved to rule out financial support for Adani's massive Carmichael coal mine project!
It began on Friday evening, when Market Forces received a statement from a spokesperson for China Construction Bank that said:
""China Construction Bank is not involved with, nor considering involvement with, the Adani Carmichael Mine project.""
They elaborated to confirm that the bank:
""...are not considering involvement now, nor will they be considering involvement in the future.""
Then on Sunday afternoon, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China released this statement, saying: 
""ICBC has not been, and does not intend to be, engaged in arranging financing for this project."" 
Finally, Bank of China issued a statement on Tuesday afternoon, saying ""Bank of China has not, and does not intend to, provide funding for the Adani Carmichael Mine project"".



The significance of ICBC, CCB and Bank of China







Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China or China Construction Bank are massive – among the biggest commercial banks in the world by assets.
All three banks are also current lenders to China Machinery Engineering Corporation, the company Adani has been negotiating with to become part of their Carmichael coal mine and rail project.
Losing these banks takes a huge amount of potential finance off the table and the fact that these banks are the top three commercial lenders to coal mining, says a huge amount about how environmentally damaging and reputationally risky the Carmichael project is.

How are large palm oil companies financed? And what role do investors like banks, pension funds and passive investment funds play in the ongoing abusive social and environmental practices of these companies? Why are financial institutions not taking their responsibility to provide green, social and sustainable investments?
In this background paper, SOMO explores the diverse financial instruments and complex channels of the financial sector through which big companies are financed. This is done through a specific example, the Salim conglomerate, which has subsidiaries with palm oil production in Indonesia.
The paper provides an overview of the wide range of financiers involved and reveals financing instruments scattered around the world, offering profitability for a wide range of global financial players. Also, this paper provides insight into the lack of a national and international regulatory framework that relates to the actual operating practices of the financial sector and its (lack of) influence over companies.

","The Chain: Paradise Papers Links APRIL’s Tax Avoidance to Deforestation and Banks, Could Impact USD 500 Million Loan",ABN AMRO ,Netherlands,APRIL ,forestry - pulp and paper,Indonesia,"
Update: on November 24, 30 Indonesian NGOs urged APRIL's financiers to not support APRIL and to disengage from any existing support or investment.
Asian Pacific Resources International (APRIL), one of the world’s largest pulp-and-paper companies, has been linked to deforestation in Indonesia. With the leak of the so-called ‘Paradise Papers’ this week, further information about APRIL’s financial backers have been revealed, leading to more questions about whether banks such as ABN AMRO follow their own sustainability policies and how global corporations may use tax engineering to increase funds available for deforestation.
These questions come as an APRIL subsidiary, as reported by Bloomberg, seeks a potential USD 500 million loan. Funders for this possible loan may include their previous lenders such as ABN AMRO, Maybank, Bank of China or others. According to Bloomberg, the loan is currently under syndication which means that banks are in the process of deciding to proceed or not proceed to finance the loan.
The Paradise Papers, 13.4 million files leaked from offshore law firm Appleby, demonstrate how global corporations move money to tax havens to avoid taxes and other government regulations. Last week, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalist (ICIJ) published a report based on the Paradise Papers that analyzes Asia Pacific Resources International (APRIL) and its lenders, one of many Asia-based companies in the forest sector that used the law firm’s services.
Records from Appleby support previous statements from advocates, researchers and government officials that the global financial system’ use of tax havens has expanded access to resources for companies involved in deforestation and other practices linked with climate change. These fears are especially pronounced in Indonesia, which has both the world’s highest rate of deforestation and its third-most land covered by tropical forest.
Do APRIL’s Banks Face Reputation Issues for Continued Lending?
APRIL expected responses from potential lending banks by November 7th for a USD 500 million loan for Asia Symbol, its privately-held subsidiary. But the Paradise Papers may raise reputational issues for financiers who do business with the company, which was found in 2016 by the Government of Indonesia to have logged peatlands on Padang Islandin violation of Indonesian law. As described by ICIJ, APRIL pushed lenders to loosen environmental standards on a USD 600 million loan in 2011. Some of APRIL’s lenders, shown in Figure 1 (below), have detailed lender criteria for the pulp, paper, rubber and palm oil sectors. Given past allegations, potential lenders would have to conduct detailed due diligence to ensure that APRIL is not in violation of these lenders’ lending criteria.

Figure 1: Previous Lenders to APRIL’s Subsidiaries. Source: Bloomberg.
One of these prior lenders was the Dutch bank ABN AMRO. If ABN AMRO continues to lend to APRIL and its subsidiaries and participates in the loan, as shown in Figure 2 (below), ABN AMRO should consider extra efforts via due diligence and other activities to mitigate the risk that lending to APRIL may violate ABN AMRO’s lending standards. ABN AMRO’s lending standards are described in its Sustainability Sector Policy for Agri Commodities, which covers forest commodities including pulp, paper, rubber and palm oil.
Likewise, last November 2016, civil society engaged APRIL’s lender Credit Suisse to address APRIL’s allegedly illegal peatland clearing. The environmental coalition Jikalahari and local communities from Riau province sent two letters Credit Suisse and ABN AMRO describing their concerns. In December 2016, WWF and Greenpeace ceased working with APRIL also because of its allegedly illegal peatland clearing.
KPMG’s Independent Limited Assurance Report of APRIL’s 2015-2016 Sustainability Report reports that APRIL’s contested landbank due to unresolved land conflicts with local communities – including third-party suppliers – is 104,009 hectares (ha). APRIL reported its contested landbank in its 2015-2016 sustainability report released November 8, 2017. APRIL’s overall landbank consists of:

476,000 ha industrial forest plantations
419,000 ha conservation and ecosystem restoration areas
322,000 ha peatland under conservation and restoration

The Sustainability Policy Transparency Toolkit (SPOTT)’s timber, pulp and paper company assessment launched November 9 ranks APRIL second globally out of 24 timber, pulp and paper companies supply chain policies and overall environmental, social, governance criteria. SPOTT’s analysis used APRIL’s 2013-2014 sustainability report. It is important to note that these policies may not translate to into implementation on the ground. SPOTT’s mandate for its analytical process did not include addressing tax avoidance and the use of tax havens and secrecy jurisdictions, as described in the Paradise Papers.
In the meantime, there are no documents or loan covenants available via Bloomberg stating if this USD 500 million loan to APRIL’s subsidiary will apply prohibitions against sourcing pulp and paper linked to deforestation and if the funds will not be used potentially illegally to drain Indonesia’s peatlands, contrary to Government of Indonesia policies.

",New report: Towards responsible and inclusive financing of the palm oil sector,ANZ ,Australia,Wilmar International ,agriculture - palm oil ,Singapore,"

The global palm oil sector faces ongoing threats to sustainability caused by deforestation, peatland development, labor rights violations and land right conflicts. Additionally, integrating smallholders into sustainable palm oil supply chains continues to be a challenge for the industry. Financial service providers (FSPs) could play a role in stimulating sustainability commitments from the palm oil companies they finance. Their potential influence stems from their capacity to set environmental, social and governance (ESG) conditions for financial services.
This research shows that European and US FSPs are further along than their counterparts in Asia in adopting policies that include ESG risk assessments as part of the process for providing financial services. However, attention to smallholder inclusion is insufficient in the policies of all FSPs included in this report. Differences between European and US versus Asian FSPs in adopting ESG standards, as well as the unique markets they finance, present a risk that two parallel but separate financial systems could emerge.
Efforts by both government and nongovernmental organizations should emphasize the prevention of a two-tiered marketplace with different quality requirements for palm oil. All actors in this sector still require a significant shift in thinking on the benefits of including ESG standards in cultivation and production processes. In palm oil producing countries, the lack of specific banking regulations emphasizing sustainability concerns regarding the sector forms a further hindrance to positive developments.

",Investing in Amazon destruction - new report by Amazon Watch,JPMorgan Chase ,United States,,,,"
Today Amazon Watch released a report, Investing in Amazon Destruction, demonstrating how global financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock put the climate, indigenous peoples, and their customers at risk with their continued financing of companies that drill for oil in the Amazon rainforest. Although JPMorgan and BlackRock have impressively-worded commitments to environmental and social corporate responsibility and their CEOs have made statements in support of initiatives like the Paris Climate Agreement, by investing in companies drilling for oil in the Amazon, they are literally bankrolling the path to an unlivable and inequitable world.
 
In addition to documenting this double speak, the report finds that the threat to climate stability and indigenous rights posed by oil extraction in the Amazon directly translates to serious legal, reputational, political, and financial risks for the operating companies and their financial backers.

Oil drilling in the Amazon devastates indigenous communities and one of the ecosystems most vital to avoiding climate chaos. Indigenous communities know this and are actively resisting projects by companies financed by JPMorgan and BlackRock, including GeoPark, which recently bought a concession to explore for oil on Achuar territory in the Peruvian Amazon; Andes Petroleum, which has plans to drill for oil on Sápara territory in the Ecuadorian Amazon; and Frontera, which insists on maintaining a drilling contract in Peru despite massive indigenous protests.

Nijmegen ","'Equator Banks, Act!' campaign welcomes decision to revise the Equator Principles",,,,,,"
The Core group of organisations leading the global ‘Equator Banks, Act!’ campaign  welcomed the decision of the Equator Principles Association (EPA) to start a full revision process of the Equator Principles (EP). The group offered to constructively engage with the EPA on the revision process but warned that it will continue to monitor transactions under the EP framework and will vigorously oppose any EP project with a large negative impact on climate change and/or on indigenous territories.


The decision to revise the Principles was communicated on November 1st  in a statement from the EPA steering committee  which summarised the outcomes of the Brazil EPA annual meeting of October 24. It stated that “The EP Association is ... planning to start a process of updating the Equator Principles. The aim of the process will be on a targeted update to the EPs – ‘EP4’ – that will consider the key issues of scope of applicability, human rights (inclusive of the rights of Indigenous Peoples), and climate change, amongst others.” The statement further noted that the revision process will include consultations with external stakeholders and is to be concluded within 18 months (June 2019).


The decision of the EPA to revise the Principles appears to be a direct response to the demands of the ‘Equator Banks, Act!’ campaign, which generated unprecedented public interest in the outcomes of this year’s annual meeting. The campaign started on August 29 with an open letter from 65 organisations  calling on the Equator banks to make stronger commitments on ‘stopping the financing of climate disasters’ and to ‘fully respect Indigenous Peoples’ rights’ when considering financial support for projects. A global call to support these demands received the backing of nearly 250 organisations and over 110,000 individuals in a matter of two months.

Johan Frijns, director of BankTrack, commented: “Starting a full revision process was the only sensible decision for the Equator Principles Association to make. Already in 2013, the climate commitments contained in the current version of the EPs were wholly insufficient to prevent banks from financing the fossil fuel projects that pose an unacceptable risk to the world's climate. To stick to these outdated Principles in a post Paris Agreement world would have made them utterly irrelevant. What matters now is for the new Principles to be sufficiently ambitious, in light of the massive risk being posed by accelerating climate change. We intend to hold the EP banks’ feet to the fire, not only in the forthcoming review process but also in their selection of projects for finance before much more realistic standards are in place.”

 
Michelle Chan, Vice-President of Programs, Friends of the Earth US, said: “This is one of the achievements of the indigenous-led struggle against the Dakota Access Pipeline. Activists around the world pressured banks to pull out of DAPL, and blasted them for not having strong policies to prevent them funding projects that harmed the climate and indigenous peoples. Now 91 banks have agreed to adopt policies covering climate change and indigenous rights. This is an exciting step, but we will have to continue being vigilant and hold these banks accountable.”

Okereke Chinwike, Executive Director, African Law Foundation (AFRILAW), Nigeria, states: “This is part of global efforts toward building a better society for all where respect of human rights including indigenous peoples’ rights and climatic justice is at the center of  every development or any business operation. The 91 members of the EPA must show their commitment and demonstrate a strong will to ensure that the revision of the EPA is not far from this vision. In Africa, we will keep tracking the ongoing financing for equator complaint disaster projects, and their human rights impacts.""

Vanessa Green, Director, DivestInvest Individual, said: ""Given the banks' track record, seeing is believing at this stage. It's clear people and communities can influence bank behavior by affecting their reputation and their bottom line, so we'll continue to support personal, business and institutional account closures until we see project permits pulled or denied, fossil fuel company lines of credit left unrenewed, and tar sands operations contracting rather than expanding.""

Leila Salazar-López, Executive Director, Amazon Watch, said: ""We welcome the news that banks are waking up to the urgent need to reexamine how their investments fuel climate chaos and indigenous rights violations, from the Arctic to the Amazon. We call on EPA members, including banks like JPMorgan that we know fund companies wanting to drill for oil in the Amazon, to fully engage in this process and develop strong, effective principles.""

Kelly Martin, Director of Beyond Dirty Fuels, Sierra Club: ""We commend the Equator Principles Association for its intention to update the Principles, and to include human rights, indigenous rights, and climate among the issues under consideration. Loopholes that allowed Equator bank support for dangerous projects -- including the Dakota Access Pipeline -- not only put frontline communities in danger, but also expose the banks to serious economic risk. Respecting indigenous rights and addressing climate change is not only the right thing to do, it is the only fiscally responsible choice.""

 
Osprey Orielle Lake, Executive Director/Founder, Women’s Earth and Climate Action Network (WECAN), commented, “There is no time to lose as climate disruption escalates and people around the world face life and death situations—particularly Indigenous and frontline communities. We commend the decision of the Equator Principles Association to revise their guidelines as Indigenous peoples and concerned groups around the world are calling for financial institutions engaged in fossil fuel extraction and development projects to stop business as usual given egregious violations against Indigenous peoples, their lands and human rights - and given the urgency of climate change. It is vital for banks to course correct now to respect Indigenous Peoples’ right to Free, Prior and Informed Consent and to transition off fossil fuels as we look towards a better future.” 

 
Eric B. Stevenson González from Madrid Resistance, said: ""It's always good to see people with the power to change things for the better make the decision to do so. Now, we'll be watching for that decision to turn to prompt action and look forward to seeing the results of that action shortly - in the form of a notable decrease in projects affecting climate change and the disappearance of reports from indigenous peoples of violations of the rights and sovereignty of their communities.""

Michelle Cook, Divest, Invest, Protect (WECAN International) ""Securing indigenous peoples ability to deny or withhold their free, prior, and informed consent to development projects in their traditional territories is critical to ensuring their human rights, physical existence, and cultural survival. Indigenous peoples are the protectors of the world's last regions on biodiversity therefore implementing their right to FPIC over their homelands, and supporting their right to say ""No"" to harmful development projects occurring within those territories protects not just indigenous peoples, but the world's remaining natural resources. Without consent, indigenous peoples will continue to disproportionately experience environmental exploitation, conflict, and violence when it comes to invasive energy development by multinational corporations. Indigenous peoples are more than ""risks""; they are rights and title holders who are seeking peaceful self-determined development and futures. As our species stands on a great precipice of climate change and uncertainty, protecting our collective well-being, by protecting indigenous peoples human rights to FPIC, is one of the most logical steps to follow, not only for banks adhering to and currently revising the Equator Principles, but also states, non-state actors, and civil society.""

",Big banks complicit in massive tar sands destruction and pollution through hundreds of billions in financing ,Banco Santander ,Spain,Line 3 Pipeline Replacement Project (L3RP) ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,United States,"
According to a new report released today, commercial banks continue to finance the tar sands sector at levels that do not align with the Paris Agreement 1.5° to 2° target –– and finance levels are surging in 2017.  The report, released by Rainforest Action Network (RAN) and 11 organizations from around the world, finds that tar sands financing for producers and pipeline companies so far in 2017 is already at levels 50% greater than all of the financing committed in 2016.
""At the COP, while governments prepare to take stock of their progress toward reaching the Paris Agreement goals, banks must do the same,"" said Patrick McCully, Rainforest Action Network’s Climate and Energy Program Director. ""We call on global banks to establish policies immediately that align their actions with their stated support for averting climate disaster and respecting Indigenous and human rights. This must include exiting the tar sands sector and strengthening policies to ensure that Indigenous rights are respected.""
Tar sands are a unique fuel due to high extraction costs, difficulties in getting to market, huge reserves, greenhouse-gas intensity, major local environmental and Indigenous rights impacts, and immediate substitutability by less carbon-intensive and cheaper alternatives. And yet, the thirty-three banks analyzed in this report have financed tar sands to the tune of $32 billion in 2017 alone.
""When President Trump announced he would pull the US out of the Paris Agreement, he drew a line: the Paris Agreements’ goal of limiting climate change to 1.5°C on one side, and his administration on the other. On what side of the line do banks fall? JPMorgan Chase’s CEO has said he disagrees with Trump on this issue, and yet, the bank has increased its financing for tar sands this year, banking on major companies as they acquire new tar sands assets,"" said Alison Kirsch, Rainforest Action Network’s Climate and Energy Program Research Coordinator.
JPMorgan Chase is again found to be the largest U.S. banker of tar sands, and with its policy grade at a D+, the bank clearly lacks guardrails to curtail this financing.
""What we need to stay on target is a rapid fossil fuel phase out. Meanwhile the world’s biggest banks are financing the consolidation and expanding production of one of the most extreme fossil fuels, tar sands,"" said Yann Louvel, Climate and Energy Campaign Coordinator at BankTrack. “While a few European banks have put in place policies to restrict this dangerous financing, most big banks lack firm policies to exclude support for expansion of the tar sands, which is necessary on climate and moral grounds.”
In response to public pressure from Indigenous-led and grassroots organizations, as well organizing by NGOs in Europe, some banks have made policy commitments to cut tar sands funding. In October 2017, BNP Paribas, the second-largest bank in Europe, established a new standard for global banks. The tar sands portion of the policy excludes companies with more than 30% of their business in tar sands, and rules out financing for the full range of tar sands projects including pipelines: Keystone XL, Trans Mountain and  Line 3.
A complementary report by Greenpeace and Oil Change International, 'In the Pipeline: Risks for funders of tar sands pipelines,' also released this week, warns of major banks’ exposure to financial and reputational damage due to their financing of tar sands pipelines. The report examines in depth the range of risks impacting all three proposed tar sands pipelines including legal challenges, opposition from Indigenous and local communities, threats to drinking water and economic vulnerability.
Additional statements:
""Extreme weather events are accelerating, heat records are broken year after year, but banks still put their profits first, over the climate and humanity. When they refuse to end business relationships with companies that, like Enbridge and TransCanada, continue to develop a sector as risky as the tar sands, they are ignoring the 1.5 - 2 °C targets. Yet, these companies’s new tar sands projects amply justify their exclusion from the banks' support, regardless of the activities they could develop in less carbon-intensive sectors. We will maintain the mobilisation until banks have aligned their policies with the new standard established by BNP Paribas"", stated Lucie Pinson, Private Finance Campaigner at Friends of the Earth France.
""Communities across the United States and Canada are fighting back against dirty tar sands projects that threaten the climate, and it's time for big banks to recognize that they cannot continue to fund these dangerous projects without consequences,” said Kelly Martin, director of the Sierra Club’s Beyond Dirty Fuels campaign. ""That's why local governments and institutions are divesting from banks that support fossil fuels, and thousands of people have already committed to moving their own money out of these banks. We will not back down until banks commit to investing in a future that benefits our communities, our economies, and our health.""

",Civil society joins forces to push Europe ‘beyond coal’,,,,,,"
To combat the worsening impacts of climate change and air pollution, civil society groups across 28 nations – including BankTrack – are today launching Europe Beyond Coal, a collective campaign to catalyse and hasten the move away from coal and towards clean renewable energy.
Underscoring the need for this urgent shift, new health impact modelling released by the campaign shows that in 2015 the EU’s coal fleet alone was responsible for an estimated 19,500 premature deaths and 10,000 cases of chronic bronchitis in adults. The health costs of coal are equally staggering, with up to 54 billion euros in the same one year period. 
""Momentum is building for Europe to be coal free by 2030, and civil society is coming together to make it happen, and happen sooner,"" said Kathrin Gutmann, Europe Beyond Coal Campaign Director. ""For nations to meet their commitments under the Paris climate agreement and to protect the wellbeing of its citizens, coal plants need to be closing far faster than they currently are. A coal plant in any one country is a liability for all of Europe, and our planet as a whole.""
""We’re calling on governments, cities, companies, banks and investors to cement their plans to move out of coal before the 2018 international climate meeting in Katowice, Poland. The UN climate meeting starting in Bonn next week is an excellent opportunity for additional, ambitious commitments to phase out coal,"" said Gutmann.


Since 2016, Europe Beyond Coal groups  have helped retire 16 coal plants across Europe, and 39 more are to close, with the governments of the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Finland, France, Portugal and Italy all committing these countries to being coal-free by 2030 at the latest. The campaign is focussing its efforts on turning these government coal phase out announcements into actions, and hastening the closure of Europe’s 293 remaining plants.
Concrete plans are particularly pertinent for countries like Germany, whose coal use is making it the worst greenhouse gas polluter in Europe and preventing it from meeting its climate objectives. Germany’s coal plants were responsible for an estimated 3,800 premature deaths and up to 10.5 billion euros in health costs inside and outside its borders in 2015.
Europe Beyond Coal groups are urging the new German government and all European countries dragging their feet on coal to stop backing coal utilities at home and in Brussels; to commit to coal phase-outs that ensure a fair and equitable transition for impacted workers and coal dependent regions; and to put their full weight behind a European-wide transition to a clean, renewable energy system.
Johan Frijns, director of BankTrack, said:
""In the past two years, we’ve seen some of Europe’s top banks start to end some of their financing for the coal sector, but they now have to go decisively further if their investments are supposed to be supporting and not undermining the objectives of the Paris Agreement. We need to see all European banks stopping financing for new coal mines and coal plants, not only in Europe, but around the world. And we need these banks to put pressure on the utilities they finance so that these companies themselves stop building new coal plants, and retire their existing coal plant fleet quickly enough to align with a 1.5 degrees Celsius world.
""The Europe Beyond Coal campaign will increase the collective pressure on European banks so that they deliver these phase out plans as quickly as possible.""

","Grangemouth renewable energy biomass power station: an unsustainable, high-risk potential investment",,,,,,"
In June 2013, the Scottish Government approved a highly controversial planning application by Forth Energy for a 120 MWe biomass “combined heat and power plant” at Grangemouth Port.
The proposal had faced strong opposition, including by three local Community Councils and because of concerns over impacts on air quality, sustainability, visual amenity, fisheries and water pollution. Falkirk Council objected because of concerns over visual impacts. Then, in March 2014, Forth Energy announced that it was pulling out of the project, after SSE had decided not to invest in it. However, it said that it would look for any other developer interested in taking over the plans and the planning consent .
Now, Grangemouth Renewable Energy Ltd, subsidiary of a start-up company called Silva Renewable Energy, is seeking to develop the plant. It has won a Contract for Difference for a smaller but still large plant of 85 MWe capacity. A Contract for Difference is a subsidy taking the form of a guaranteed purchase price for electricity set above the wholesale market price, called a “strike price” .
There are serious concerns that Silva Renewables could be looking to source wood pellets from highly biodiverse coastal hardwood forests in the south-eastern US, which are being clearcut, increasingly for wood pellets. This would be disastrous for biodiversity in a region designated as Biodiversity Hotspot, and it would result in overall greenhouse gas emissions no longer than those from a coal power plant of the same size.
However, there are also serious questions about the viability of the proposal and the credibility of Grangemouth/Silva Renewable Energy as a power station developer:

The directors have no track record of developing any power project, and have had little financial success with previous ventures;
The level of subsidies awarded to the proposed plant is well below that for any existing biomass power plant in the UK and the strike price awarded to the plant is much less than estimates for the levelised cost of electricity for biomass power plants, let alone biomass CHP plants;
There is no longer a credible prospect for supplying heat from the plant, which means that the planning conditions and the conditions for receiving the Contract for Difference may not be met;
The Scottish Government has set a new legal limit for fine particulate (PM2.5) concentrations from 31.12.2020. Existing PM2.5 levels in Grangemouth are near that legal limit. In order to obtain a Pollution Prevention and Control permit from the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA), PM2.5 emissions would need to be set and kept below what can a power station of this size can be expected to achieve.

",Banks warned of tar sands pipelines investment risks in new report,Barclays ,United Kingdom,Line 3 Pipeline Replacement Project (L3RP) ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,United States,"
A new report by Greenpeace and Oil Change International warns of major banks’ exposure to financial and reputational damage due to their financing of tar sands pipelines. The report, In the Pipeline: Risks for funders of tar sands pipelines, examines in depth the range of risks related to all three proposed tar sands pipelines including legal challenges, opposition from Indigenous and local communities, threats to drinking water and economic vulnerability.
 
Barclays, JPMorgan Chase and the TD Bank Group are among the world’s major banks financing tar sands pipelines and the companies behind them (Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain Expansion, TransCanada’s Keystone XL, and Enbridge’s Line 3 expansion).
 
Among the major risks identified in the report are:


Lack of Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) from all Indigenous communities impacted by the pipelines. On-the-ground resistance is already unfolding along the routes of the Kinder Morgan and Line 3 pipeline expansions. JPMorgan Chase’s human rights policy states that the bank expects its clients to align with FPIC requirements, raising questions about its pipeline lending.


Negative environmental impacts, including the contamination of drinking water from leaks. The companies proposing to build the three new tar sands pipelines have seen one spill a week, on average, in the U.S. since 2010. New pipelines threaten thousands of watercourses, aquifers and bodies of water with spills. Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain Expansion goes through a UNESCO World Heritage site, Jasper National Park, which appears to contravene TD’s policy of not financing projects that operate in such sites.


Tar sands pipelines’ economic success is dependent on tar sands expansion. Low oil prices and structural changes in oil demand, including Asian and European markets’ shift away from fossil fuel vehicles, raise questions about the long-term viability of the tar sands, and pipelines dependent on their expansion.


Short-term lending decisions undermine bank and investor action on climate. The three proposed pipelines could add almost 2 million barrels per day in pipeline capacity. Facilitating the expansion of the tar sands and enabling decades-long carbon-lock in risks fatally undermining Barclays’ plans to develop a sustainable approach for its global energy client portfolio, JPMorgan Chase’s policies, which recognize the goals of the Paris Agreement, and as TD’s work with the UN to better assess and disclose climate risks and opportunities..


The report, therefore, recommends that banks do not finance or arrange financing (including the issuance of securities), related to new tar sands pipelines. Existing funders are encouraged to sell their stakes in full or not renew credit facilities. The report further provides bank investors with a list of questions to pose to management to understand whether risks are being properly managed.
 
A forthcoming report by Rainforest Action Network and partner organizations grades large multinational banks on their policies concerning tar sands financing, finding that most lack policies to curtail their significant exposure to these risky pipelines and the companies behind them. The report will be published on November 2nd and available at www.ran.org/fundingtarsands.
 
Another report released earlier this month by the Secwepemc Nation in B.C., whose land Kinder Morgan’s new pipeline is slated to cross, further details risks related to Indigenous assertions of their rights and title over unceded land.

Nijmegen and Brisbane ",Investor alert: Deep sea mining project in last-ditch search for capital,ABN AMRO ,Netherlands,Solwara 1 Deep Sea Mining Project ,mining - non coal,Papua New Guinea,"
In a last ditch bid to rescue its experimental deep sea mining project ”Solwara 1”, the two largest shareholders of Nautilus Minerals Inc, Russian mining company Metalloinvest and Omani conglomerate MB Holdings, have formed a new company whose sole job is to secure funding for the project by October 31st .
Download the Annex showing financiers of MB Holding and Metalloinvest here.


It is expected that the first call will be on existing financiers of Nautilus, Metalloinvest and MB Holdings. These include HSBC (United Kingdom), ING Group (Netherlands), BNP Paribas and Société Générale (France); ABN Amro (Netherlands), and Unicredit (Italy) . 


The Deep Sea Mining Campaign (DSMC) and BankTrack are calling on the banks to publicly distance themselves from this financially and ecologically risky project.


Canada-based Nautilus Minerals has staked its reputation on the Solwara 1 project, which if successful would become the world's first deep sea mining operation . However the wannabe deep sea miner has so far failed to inspire investors with confidence. Nautilus' financing strategy for Solwara 1 has been spectacularly unsuccessful. Commercial operation has been delayed year after year since it received its licence to mine the floor of Papua New Guinea’s Bismarck sea in 2011.


The Solwara 1 project is deeply opposed by local communities, churches and wider civil society in Papua New Guinea. Most recently, PNG's former Attorney General and Governor of Madang Province issued a warning to potential investors of the high level of financial and environmental risk inherent in the project.

Dr. Helen Rosenbaum of the Deep Sea Mining campaign said, “Deep Sea Mining is risky business as both the environmental impacts and the returns are complete unknowns. Nautilus’ Annual Information Form, lodged with Canadian securities, emphasizes the experimental nature of the Solwara 1 project . This level of risk has scared off responsible investors who weigh up the likely exposure to social and environmental risks and the value erosion that goes with that. In regards to Nautilus, they have voted with their wallets.  We urge banks and other financiers to do the same.”


Coastal Communities in Papua New Guinea have formally requested that the PNG Government make public key documents relating to the licensing and the environmental impacts of the Solwara 1 deep sea mining project or face legal proceedings. 

 
Johan Frijns, BankTrack Director, commented, ""Experience with other mining projects shows us that local opposition often results in legal and public relations disasters for companies and their financiers.  The costs of community resistance to mining projects has been well documented .  Banks receiving proposals from Metalloinvest and MB Holdings to rescue Nautilus would be well advised to conduct a rigorous risk analysis.""
NOTES


 Nautilus announced on 11 October the formation of Deep Sea Mining Finance Ltd. (""DSMF"") which will seek to leverage the international expertise and financial relationships of Nautilus' two major shareholders to assist in advancing the development of the Company's Solwara 1 Project.


 Research commissioned by the DSM Campaign indicates that these banks provide both loans and bond issuances. See Annex 1 for more details.


 If it proceeds, the Solwara 1 mine will be located in the Bismarck Sea of Papua New Guinea, approximately 25 km from the coastline of New Ireland Province, about 35 km from Duke of York Islands and 60 km from Kokopo township in East New Britain. See BankTrack's Dodgy Deal profile for more details on the project.


  See sections on Risk factors in Annual information forms for financial years 2015 and 2016. For example:

""Our operations are speculative due to the high-risk nature of business related to the exploration and acquisition of rights to potential mineable deposits of metals. These risk factors could materially affect the Company’s future results and could cause actual events to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements relating to our Company."" (FY 2016, p 52)

""... Performance, availability, reliability, maintenance, wear and life of equipment are unknown. There can be no guarantee that sub-sea engineering and recovery systems can be developed or if developed, will be employable in a commercially-viable manner.""  (FY 2015, p54)

""... while Company studies have indicated a low likelihood of risk to the aquatic environment from mining activities, the actual impact of any SMS  mining operations on the environment has yet to be determined.” (FY 2015, p61)

""Nautilus has not completed and does not intend to complete a preliminary economic assessment, pre-feasibility study or feasibility study before completing the construction and first deployment of the Seafloor Production System at the Solwara 1 Project.”  

 
""No independent Qualified Person has confirmed the amount of these costs or recommended that these costs be incurred. There is significant risk with this approach and no assurance can be given that the Seafloor Production System, if fully funded and completed for deployment at the Solwara 1 Project, will successfully demonstrate that seafloor resource development is commercially viable."" (FY 15, p52)

Nijmegen ",Equator Principles face crucial test as Brazil annual meeting starts today,,,,,,"
As the annual meeting of the Equator Principles Association begins in São Paulo today, the banking platform is faced with the challenge of how to properly respond to a widespread public call for a significant revision to the standards.


Expectations on the meeting are high. Whereas the outcomes of earlier annual meetings often went unreported both by financial press and the Association itself, announcements of the result of this year’s event are eagerly awaited by hundreds of environmental and indigenous organisations, as well as institutional investors and religious and ethical organisations.


The global ""Equator Banks, Act!"" petition launched two months ago, which calls on the 91 Equator banks to replace the current Principles with a new set of commitments that acknowledge the responsibility of banks to act decisively on preventing accelerating climate change and fully respect Indigenous Peoples’ rights and territories when financing projects, received the support of 246 organisations and well over 110,000 individuals.


In addition, dozens of groups around the world have heeded the #DivestTheGlobe call by Indigenous platform Mazaska Talks, to join three days of protest during the course of the annual meeting. The campaign website registered actions in 44 cities in the United States and Canada yesterday, with more to come in Europe and Asia as the meeting proceeds.


Meanwhile, an interfaith group of 98 religious and ethical organizations and individuals has called on five US banks to cease financing fossil fuel projects, and investors have expressed support for a reform of the Equator Principles as proposed by ten Equator banks itself.


BankTrack wrote to the 91 Equator Principles signatory banks at the start of last week warning that in light of these public expectations, inaction at the meeting “cannot be an option”, as it would deal a fatal blow to the reputation of the Principles as the bank platform for innovation in sustainability risk management, and may well trigger a steep increase in resistance to bank finance for projects that trample Indigenous rights and contribute to wrecking the climate, under an Equator stamp of approval.

Johan Frijns, BankTrack Director said: “We trust that the EPA will see that a set of Principles that has only been moderately revised once since its inception in 2003 can no longer be the basis for how banks deal with climate risk in a post-Paris agreement world. Equator Banks that are serious about ‘managing risks’ must confront the immense risk posed by fossil fuel projects on the world’s climate, and this risk must become a reason for rejecting financing these projects. The alternative for the Association is to be seen as actively accommodating the financing of projects that lead to a further deepening of the climate crisis and a deterioration of the plight of Indigenous Peoples.”

Patrick McCully, Rainforest Action Network Climate and Energy Director said: “The bottom line is that the Equator Principles need a serious reworking. Without meaningful protections for the climate and Indigenous rights, the Principles will continue to fail us in aligning finance flows with the goals of the Paris Agreement. With our world unraveling in climate disaster after climate disaster, we must demand greater ambition from the financial industry and the Equator Principles Association.”

Kelly Martin, Sierra Club Beyond Dirty Fuels Director said: ""Equator Bank support for projects like the Dakota Access Pipeline - projects that are mired in legal fights and violent crackdowns on Indigenous communities who are denied their rights - have made it clear that the Principles are failing as a risk management tool. The Equator Principles should first and foremost respect the rights of First Nations people and take seriously the threat of climate change.""

Jackie Fielder, Co-founder Mazaska Talks said: “The futility of the Equator Principles to uphold internationally recognized standards for climate change mitigation and indigenous rights shows that it is up to us to divest from Big Banks and re-invest in community banks, public banks, credit unions, and B-corp banks that invest in our communities.”

Cecilia Gomez, Women’s March Barcelona said: “Women are disproportionately affected by climate change. At the same time women’s control of household spending is on the rise throughout the world. These two issues are intrinsically linked and our awareness is growing. We must join with organizations that are fighting on the front lines to mitigate these disasters and push the banks that invest our money to do the same.”

Doug Norlen, Economic Policy Director for Friends of the Earth US said: “The Equator Banks have failed to adopt robust standards to protect indigenous communities and tackle climate change, despite the global imperative to do so. If we are to save ourselves from the rising tides of climate change, banks should at least stop making holes in the boat.”

Vanessa Green, Director of DivestInvest Individual said: “These financial institutions are among the most well resourced companies in the world, entrusted with managing and minimizing the risk of massive amounts of investor and other capital. If they are not responsive to the clear inadequacy of the Equator Principles in their current form, and are not computing the risks of financing large fossil fuel infrastructure projects that harm people, communities and land, then they cannot be the companies to manage that capital any longer. Fortunately, the leadership and staff of many other large and small institutions are putting the work in to revise principles, policies and practices to attract the socially responsible and carbon conscious investors of today - and tomorrow.""

Leila Salazar-López, Executive Director of Amazon Watch said: “As we see and feel the impacts of climate change, it is clear that the Equator Principles have failed to hold banks to standards that adequately account for their role in funding the climate crisis and the continued violation of Indigenous Peoples’ rights. If they don’t take bold action today, these financial institutions will continue to find themselves confronted by those of us who care for the planet and our Indigenous brothers and sisters, from the Arctic to the Amazon.”

Osprey Orielle Lake, Executive Director and Founder of the Women’s Earth and Climate Action Network (WECAN) said: “We need the Equator Banks to stop business as usual with the fossil fuel industry given egregious violations against Indigenous Peoples and their rights and given the urgency of climate change. Since guidelines that are supposed to uphold rights are failing, then the Equator Principles must be revised to take into account Indigenous rights and climate chaos. There is no time to lose as climate disruption escalates and people around the world face life and death situations. Financial institutions must course correct now, so that we all can look towards a better future.”  

Robin Martinez, attorney with the National Lawyers Guild said: ""It is long past time for global financial institutions to strengthen their approach to financing projects that affect our environment, climate, and the rights of Indigenous Peoples. The language of corporate social responsibility has been part of our vernacular for years, but we have yet to see lofty goals grounded in meaningful action. The member banks of the Equator Principles Association have a choice. They can demonstrate real leadership and live up to our shared obligations to our environment and fellow human beings, or they can choose not to act and reveal that they have no genuine regard for principles. I hope they choose to exercise leadership and show us that the financial sector can be a force for significant positive change. As we see and feel the impacts of climate change, it is clear that the Equator Principles have failed to hold banks to standards that adequately account for their role in funding the climate crisis and the continued violation of Indigenous Peoples’ rights. If they don’t take bold action today, these financial institutions will continue to find themselves confronted by those of us who care for the planet and our Indigenous brothers and sisters, from the Arctic to the Amazon.”

Seattle, WA ",Indigenous people lead global divestment protest as banks discuss Equator Principles,,,,,,"
Today 91 banks will meet at the start of the annual meeting (Oct 23-25) of the Equator Principles Association (EPA) in Sao Paulo, Brazil. At this time, the indigenous-led divestment campaign, Mazaska Talks, is leading a global 3-day protest known as #DivestTheGlobe. On Monday, there will be actions in at least 44 cities in the United States and Canada. On Tuesday and Wednesday, there will be actions in Africa, Europe and Asia.

The protests are designed to galvanize people to divest their households, institutions, and cities from banks that finance desecration projects, such as tar sands pipelines. The protests are being supported by many national organizations such as 350.org, Rainforest Action Network, Greenpeace and the Sierra Club, some of whom have added their names to a letter promising to boycott the banks until they stop investing in tar sands.
As part of the protests, Mazaska Talks urges banks to follow the example of BNP Paribas, the second largest bank in Europe, which last week promised to cease all funding of companies whose primary business is tar sands, fracking, or Arctic drilling.
In conjunction with BankTrack’s campaign, the protests draw attention to the failure of the Equator Principles to align with the Paris Agreement and uphold internationally-recognized indigenous rights to Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) in the case of the Dakota Access Pipeline, Line 3, Keystone XL, Trans Mountain, and other fossil fuel projects around the world.
The demonstrations come two months after the Energy Transfer family of companies sued Greenpeace and BankTrack for supporting the #NoDAPL movement and calling on people to divest from banks financing the Dakota Access Pipeline. Energy Transfer received project-level financing for the project by assuring banks they had consulted with the tribe, thus aligning the project with the Equator Principles. Consultation is merely an exchange of information, not consent. Indigenous people have a right to consent, recognized in the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People.
Energy Transfer inadvertently admitted the effectiveness of #DefundDAPL divestment campaigns in their SLAPP suit, pointing out, “the damage to Plaintiffs’ relationships with the capital markets has been substantial, impairing access to financing and increasing their cost of capital and ability to fund future projects at economical rates.""
Since the Standing Rock Tribe passed a resolution ending business with Wells Fargo in October 2016, more than a dozen cities have taken some step towards moving their money out of Wall Street, affecting dozens of billions of dollars in annual cash flow.
Divest the Globe: Quotes and Support
“Big oil, multinational corporations and their financial backers are not persuaded by moral and environmental arguments. Nor do they even care for following the rule of law, as we have witnessed violation after violation of Tribal Nations’ treaty rights. They’re capitalist and they are persuaded by one thing, money. So Indigenous Nations and their allies are rising up to create a future with clean water and respect for human rights,” Matt Remle, co-Founder of Mazaska Talks
“Until these banks start investing in the future of Mother Earth, we will bring attention to the injustice they contribute to and we will continue to use divestment as a tool to help end these atrocities,” Rachel Heaton, co-Founder of Mazaska Talks
“Making the transition from fossil fuels to green power is no longer a matter of financial capital, but of political will. These banks have learned nothing from Standing Rock or the Great Recession, so it’s up to us to make our own public banks and finance our own communities,” Jackie Fielder, Organizer with Mazaska Talks
“In order to create a better future for our next generation, we must encourage the banks who hold the worlds funds to divest from fossil fuels which destroy the environment. We must stand up and empower ourselves to divest, because divestment is empowerment,” Ladonna Brave Bull Allard, Founder of Sacred Stone Village
“We have the right to Free Prior and Informed Consent of projects impacting our survival, our cultures and our futures. We want the global financial community to realize that investing in projects that harm us is really investing in death, genocide, racism and does have a direct effect on not only us on the frontlines but every person on this planet. They have a moral obligation to listen to us, to invest in sustainable energy projects which bring lasting growth and jobs not built on dying industries like coal and oil,” Joye Braun, Community Organizer with Indigenous Environmental Network
“Anyone with a brain, not to mention a conscience, should put their money in a bank that actually thinks the planet has a future, instead of one that scrambles for the shortest of short term gains at any cost,” Bill McKibben, Founder of 350.org  
""Wells Fargo and other big banks that finance dirty fossil fuel projects should take notice: this movement isn't going anywhere,"" said Sierra Club Beyond Dirty Fuels campaign director Kelly Martin. ""Communities across the country are calling on their local governments and institutions to divest from banks that support fossil fuels, and thousands of people have already committed to moving their own money out of these banks. We will not back down until banks commit to investing in a future that benefits our communities, our economies, and our health.""
“Responsible banks don’t put their money into projects that bulldoze Indigenous rights, jeopardize clean water, threaten wildlife and destabilize our climate. As the world's biggest banks meet to discuss Indigenous rights in Brazil, we're standing with Mazaska Talks and Indigenous leaders everywhere who are resisting destructive fossil fuel projects. Contested oil pipelines pose too many risks and face too many hurdles to succeed long-term. Already, some of the world’s biggest banks such as BNP Paribas, ING, and US Bank are stepping away from these projects. It’s time for the rest of the financial sector to follow suit,” Alex Speers-Roesch, Finance campaigner, Greenpeace Canada
“Major fossil fuel infrastructure projects like the Teck Resources Frontier Mine, KXL, Kinder Morgan and Line 3 pipelines require outside funding to be completed, giving banks an outsized role in shaping our collective climate future,” said Ruth Breech with Rainforest Action Network. “For too long financial institutions have escaped accountability for the real world consequences of their investments, the time for that impunity has come to an end.”
“Ever since the City of Seattle broke ties with Wells Fargo, it’s been crystal clear that the banks stand to lose billions of dollars because of their funding of projects that both abuse the rights of Indigenous communities and are a disaster for our climate,” said 350 Seattle organizer Alec Connon
""Holding big banks accountable by closing accounts is addressing a root cause of outdated and dangerous fossil fuel infrastructure development and egregious human rights violations,"" said Vanessa Green, Director of DivestInvest Individual. ""People, public institutions and private businesses all moving money means real impact on banks and the broader finance industry, as evidenced by updated or new standards, policies, products and services. As finance industry leaders respond, the laggards are exposed and will be the biggest losers.""
“We live in extraordinary times that require bold decisions. Huge parts of the Caribbean and the South coast of the US are in ruin after three hurricanes in a row, Vietnam is dealing with immense floods and Ireland has been hit by a tropical hurricane.  Business as usual, that is for the banks to stick to the outdated 2013 version of the Equator Principles in a Post-Paris-Agreement world, cannot be an option for how they intend to deal with those risks,” said Johan Frijns, BankTrack director

",Environmental Paper Network is concerned about a huge biorefinery in Estonia,,,Est-For Pulp Mill ,forestry - pulp and paper,Estonia,"
A letter of concern has been sent to Estonian company Est-For Invest, signed by the Environmental Paper Network (EPN) in support of a dozen Estonian environmental non-governmental organisations (NGOs).
The Est-For pulp mill project in Estonia is a planned biorefinery, projected to launch production in 2022, that will produce energy and pulp. If built, the Est-For biorefinery will produce an annual output of 700,000 tonnes of pulp, and consume 2.5 to 4 million cubic metres of wood per year, for many decades - an enormous amount in the Estonian context.
Mandy Haggith, coordinator of EPN said, “The letter expresses our worries about the planned Est-For biorefinery development, as there appear to be insufficient safeguards in place to prevent negative impacts on the environment. We will be warning against investment in this project until strong safeguards are put in place.""
The Environmental Paper Network and the Estonian environmental NGOs are deeply concerned about possible impacts, including the following:

Risks of pollution impacting the water quality of River Emajõgi and Lake Peipus
Risks to Estonian forests because of the additional timber demand for the refinery, which is very likely to harm biodiversity and reduce carbon stocks, and lack of any guarantees about certification of wood supplies
Inadequate criteria for the environmental impact assessment (EIA) given the scale of this project
Future risks that environmental regulations will be weakened to prop up such a large industrial operation.

Banks and other financiers should ensure the following set of safeguards is in place before considering proceeding with finance for this project:

The Est-For pulp mill should only source wood with FSC certification
Water for the mill must be limited to a closed system, and any effluent should be at least as clean as the river’s water itself
An environmental impact assessment should be conducted according to high standards.

The environmental organisations are also concerned about a boom in wood fibre demand, that could lead to a weakening of conservation measures and forest protection. Before allowing any large investments that will substantially increase the consumption of timber, the Estonian government must make sure that sustainable use of Estonia's forests is assured, including approving appropriate legal measures.
The letter can be found here. BankTrack's dodgy deal profile on the Est-For Pulp Mill can be viewed here.
Environmental Paper Network (EPN) is a global coalition of 145 non-governmental organisations working in alignment towards a common vision for pulp and paper production and use that contributes to a clean, healthy, just and sustainable future for life on earth.

Poland ",Expert on plans to build the Ostrołęka C power plant - this is a big mistake,,,Ostroleka C coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Poland,"

As the cire.pl portal quotes in its article, expert opinions agree that the planned 1000 MW block in Ostrołęka will never close the financial gap and will worsen the conditions for the economic recovery of a similar class of blocks that are being built in Opole, Jaworzno and Kozienice.
- As a member of the Energa Wytwarzanie Supervisory Board, I took part in the development of the plan for modernization or construction of a new power plant in Ostrołęka based on two 240-250 MW coal blocks. These were supposed to be regulatory blocks. Building a single block where regulatory blocks are needed is a great risk, as this block has to be repaired or it may break down. Then a loss of 1000 MW in a single block is a huge risk, also due to the network operation – said Wojciech Myślecki.
The expert also noted that the connection conditions issued 10 years ago concerned the development of investments in a combined renewable energy system.
The Energy Congress brings together representatives of the government, energy companies, experts and scientists dealing with the issues of Polish, European and global energy on a daily basis. This year's third edition was held under the slogan ""Safety, transformation, efficiency"".
Hazards and problems of the Ostrołęka C power plant seem not to be noticed by the project owner. Recently, he officially announced the date the new block of the Ostrołęka power plant would become operational. As reported to the media in September this year by the Energa Group, the construction of a new power unit Ostrołęka C will start in 2018, and the production of electricity is planned to begin six years later.

Nijmegen ",Pressure builds on next week's Equator Principles meeting to address climate change and Indigenous rights,,,,,,"
The annual meeting of the Equator Principles, to be held on 24th and 25th October in São Paulo, is under more pressure than ever before as more than 55,000 people and 220 groups join a call to action for a significant revision to the standards. The civil society watchdog BankTrack today wrote to the 91 bank signatories of the Equator Principles warning that inaction at the meeting “cannot be an option”. 



The Equator Principles are a set of voluntary standards signed by 91 financial institutions, mostly private sector banks, to govern their finance for large infrastructure projects. They are supposed to strengthen risk management by ensuring that projects being financed are ‘developed in a manner that is socially responsible and reflects sound environmental management practices’.


However a campaign website calls attention to a series of ‘disaster projects’ that have been financed supposedly in full compliance with the Equator Principles, including the Dakota Access Pipeline in the United States, last year resisted by a historic Native American-led protest camp at Standing Rock, and the Agua Zarca hydroelectric project in Honduras, associated with the murder of Indigenous human rights defender Berta Cáceres last year after she led Indigenous resistance to the project.


The “Equator Banks, Act!” campaign is calling on the Equator Principles Association to agree in Brazil to a full revision process for the Principles, so that they meet two commitments at minimum: firstly to support the climate goals agreed in Paris by excluding finance for new fossil fuel projects, and secondly to respect the rights of Indigenous Peoples to freely provide or withhold their consent for projects impacting their land.


BankTrack, which is coordinating the campaign, has warned that without reform the Principles’ reputation as a “global sustainability gold standard” could be fatally undermined. In addition to the global call to action, Mazaska Talks  is calling on Indigenous Peoples and their allies everywhere to join three days of mass global action to coincide with the banks’ meeting, to “demand banks stop financing repression of Indigenous rights, human rights abuses, and desecration of the earth.”


Johan Frijns, BankTrack director, appealed to the banks in today's letter, on behalf of all supporters of the “Equator Banks, Act!” campaign: “We live in extraordinary times that require bold decisions. As we write this letter to you, huge parts of the Caribbean and the South coast of the US are in ruin after three hurricanes in a row, the wine valleys of California are on fire, Vietnam is dealing with immense floods and Ireland is being hit by a tropical hurricane.  Business as usual, that is sticking to the outdated 2013 version of the Equator Principles in a Post-Paris-Agreement world, cannot be an option for how you intend to deal with those risks.”

Nijmegen, Paris ",BNP Paribas takes the global lead in excluding unconventional fossil fuels from portfolio ,BNP Paribas ,France,Texas LNG Terminal ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,United States,"
Friends of the Earth France and BankTrack have strongly welcomed the new commitments of French bank BNP Paribas to help accelerate the energy transition and drastically reduce its financing of so called unconventional fossil fuels: tar sands, shale gas, oil and gas exploration projects in the Arctic region, as well as all related infrastructure for transport and export . Both organisations call upon other banks to follow BNP Paribas’ lead and also take steps to reduce their financing of unconventional fossil fuels, starting at the upcoming Annual Meeting of the Equator Principles Association on October 24 in Brazil.

Reacting to the news, Lucie Pinson, private finance campaigner for Friends of the Earth France, said:

""BNP Paribas is showing real leadership with these new announcements. It is great news for the climate and a huge victory for the groups who have been mobilizing in support of Indigenous Peoples who are on the front line of the impacts of tar sands, shale gas and LNG projects in North America. We call on all other commercial banks to follow BNP Paribas’ lead, and adopt similar measures to align their financing with the Paris Agreement climate objectives.""

The announcement follows months of campaigning by many organisations, in France and in the United States, which put pressure on the bank for its involvement in several dodgy deals, including the Dakota Access Pipeline and Texas LNG .

In May this year, a delegation of water advocates and representatives of Native American tribes travelled to France to meet with French banks at their AGMs, to ask them to give up financing plans for tar sands pipelines and liquefied natural gas export terminals in the United States, and to exclude the companies involved from financing. This call has now been honoured by BNP Paribas.

The fact that BNP Paribas will not finance Texas LNG is a serious setback for the project and also a reality check for other French bank Société Générale, which views the Rio Grande LNG project, six times larger than Texas LNG, as being beneficial for the transition to clean energy. 

The policy announcement from BNP Paribas comes as international mobilisation increases against three tar sands pipeline projects planned in the United States and Canada (Keystone XL, Trans Mountain and Line 3), after a fourth one, Energy East, got officially canceled last week. If constructed, these projects would result in violations of the rights of Native Americans as well as increased fossil fuel production detrimental to the climate and the environment. 

Yann Louvel, climate and energy campaign coordinator for BankTrack, added:

“BNP Paribas has become the first big bank in the world to commit to no longer finance either shale gas pipelines or terminals that liquefy and export mainly shale gas. It is also the first one to not only stop financing tar sands pipelines projects, but also to blacklist the companies building them, as well as those exposed to more than 30% to tar sands or shale gas. This puts the bank far ahead of all other international banks in terms of concretely reducing the financing of extreme fossil fuels that are destroying the climate and local communities around the world.”

Johan Frijns, BankTrack director, concluded:

“The 91 banks that meet in two weeks at the annual meeting of the Equator Principles Association in Brazil should follow the example of BNP Paribas and exclude all unconventional fossil fuels from financing under the risk management scheme of the Equator Principles, as such projects pose an unmanageable, extreme risk to the world's climate.""

Tokyo, Japan ",Japanese Banks ill-Equipped to Reform Banking Practices in Line with the Paris Agreement,Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) ,Japan,,,,"
350.org Japan has revealed how Japan’s seven biggest banks are inadequately prepared to meet the rising demand for environmentally responsible banking practices. Six of seven banks responded with dissatisfying answers to the My Bank My Future petition which urged banks to stop funding fossil fuels and nuclear power in line with the Paris Agreement.

The petition letter, signed by over 1000 individual account holders and delivered on September 22, urged the recipient banks to

i) disclose investments and lending to fossil fuel and nuclear-related companies,

ii) commit to investment and lending policies in line with keeping global warming below 1.5-2 degrees Celsius, and

iii) stop funding fossil fuels and nuclear power projects, and transition these funds towards investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency instead.
In response to the petition, Japan’s three major banks- Mitsubishi Tokyo UFJ, Mizuho Bank and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, explained that they have taken measures such as adopting environmentally and socially responsible principles for project loans and expanding financing for renewable energy projects. However, research conducted by 350.org Japan indicates that all seven banks are heavily involved in financing fossil fuel related companies that exacerbate climate change and none of the banks have policies to restrict such finance.
While the three major Japanese banks have adopted the Equator Principles to assess and manage environmental and social risk in financed projects, all are also major funders of the Dakota Access Pipeline project. This project has caused verifiable environmental damage and inflicted human rights abuses on the local population. This points to the limitations of such frameworks, which do not explicitly restrict finance for carbon-intensive projects or companies nor have adequate safeguards to respect the rights of Indigenous Peoples.  
Shin Furuno, 350.org Divestment Campaigner stated, “The largely inadequate responses to this petition proves that Japan’s Banks are yet to take climate risk seriously. Japan’s financial sector needs to step in line with the Paris Agreement and commit to investment and lending policies to keep global warming below 1.5-2 degrees. More and more customers expect banks to make responsible investments in a safe future.”
On November 6, 350.org Japan will commence a month-long “Let’s Divest” campaign calling on individuals and companies to switch their bank accounts to “Earth Friendly Banks” that do not fund fossil fuels or nuclear. The campaign aims to collect 100 personal and 5 organizational divestments by December 12, the two-year anniversary of the Paris Agreement, to encourage banks to divest from fossil fuels and nuclear and transition finance flows towards a 100% renewable energy society.

",Report Shines a Light on Hidden Backers of World’s Most Destructive Coal Project,Axis Bank ,India,Rampal coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Bangladesh,"
Some of the biggest players in global finance are quietly backing the world’s most dangerous coal plant, according to an investigative report released today. International investors are enabling and profiting from the proposed Rampal plant in southern Bangladesh despite persistent warnings that it will damage the world’s largest mangrove forest, intensify climate change and imperil the lives of 2 million people.
These previously hidden backers include the World Bank’s private-sector arm, the International Finance Corporation (IFC); leading U.S. asset managers BlackRock and Vanguard; pension funds including the U.S. fund for teachers, TIAA; and Japanese commercial banks. The Asian Development Bank has proposed a $700 million loan to build transmission lines in southwestern Bangladesh that will carry the electricity from the plant. All have social and environmental guidelines, or have made public statements about sustainable investment, that should preclude them from enabling a project like Rampal.
The report, “Time to Come Clean: How International Investors Can Stop the World’s Most Dangerous Coal Plant,” calls on these investors to use their leverage to halt the project. It urges the IFC, a substantial indirect backer of the project through its investments in Indian banks, to take a lead in coordinating a pushback among investors.
The report was published by U.S.-based Inclusive Development International, Bank Information Center Europe, and Delhi-based Center for Financial Accountability.
Rampal is being built just 14 kilometers from the Sundarbans, a UNESCO World Heritage-designated mangrove forest. Two million Bangladeshis and Indians depend on the Sundarbans for food, water and income. The forest also plays an outsize role in the fight against climate change by sequestering large amounts of carbon and protecting low-lying Bangladesh from cyclones and floods.
UNESCO, former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, and a number of climate and energy scientists have all called for the plant to be cancelled. An Indian-Bangladeshi consortium is developing the project.

San Francisco Bay Area, California ",Indigenous women from Standing Rock and allies on divestment delegation in Europe,,,,,,"
From September 30th through October 14th, 2017, a delegation of Indigenous women from across the United States, who have been at the forefront of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) resistance effort and other movements to stop fossil fuel extraction and infrastructure which pose threats to Indigenous and human rights, self-determination, lands and culture, will travel to Norway, Switzerland and Germany. The delegation will urge financial institutions to divest from and cancel credit facilities with pipeline companies that endanger rights and neglect Indigenous People’s right to Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) as outlined in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.
Norway, Switzerland and Germany house several of the world's largest financial institutions that, through either corporate level or project level finance, support dangerous extraction projects across Indigenous territories in the U.S. and globally - making these countries vital locations for frontline and impacted women leaders to engage directly with banks, public officials, civil society groups, and media.
The Autumn 2017 Indigenous Women's Divestment Delegation, facilitated by the Women’s Earth and Climate Action Network (WECAN) International in partnership with Indigenous women leaders and their directives, is part of a growing movement that has found the pursuit of institutional divestment to be an effective strategy to hold banks and fossil fuel related companies accountable to indigenous rights and protection of land, climate and water.
Autumn 2017 Indigenous Women’s Divestment Delegation members include - LaDonna Brave Bull Allard (Lakota historian, member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and founder/landowner of Sacred Stone Camp); Dr. Sara Jumping Eagle (Oglala Lakota and Mdewakantonwan Dakota pediatrician, living and working on the Standing Rock Reservation, North Dakota); Jackie Fielder (Mnicoujou Lakota and Mandan-Hidatsa, Campaign Coordinator of Lakota People's Law Project and organizer with Mazaska Talks); Michelle Cook (Diné/Navajo, human rights lawyer and a founding member of the Water Protector Legal Collective at Standing Rock); and Tara Houska (Anishinaabe, tribal attorney, National Campaigns Director of Honor the Earth, former advisor on Native American affairs to Bernie Sanders); along with Osprey Orielle Lake (WECAN Executive Director and delegation facilitator). Full Delegate biographies are available here.
In addition to advocating for fossil fuel divestment and investment in a renewable energy future - delegates will share vital updates regarding the Dakota Access Pipeline, the growing pipeline resistance by Indigenous peoples and allies to Keystone XL (TransCanada), Trans Mountain (Kinder Morgan), Energy East (TransCanada), and Line 3 (Enbridge) pipeline projects; and the success of municipal divestment campaigns across the United States.
The Delegation will be based in Oslo, Norway from September 30 - October 4; in Zurich, Switzerland from October 5 - 10; and in Munich and Frankfurt, Germany from October 11 - 14. Press and media are encouraged to reach out to WECAN International to schedule interviews.
“We stand to protect the water and our Mother Earth. We stand to divest from fossil fuel so our children can live. We stand because we have no other choice. Min Wiconi, Water is Life.” explains LaDonna Brave Bull Allard (Lakota historian, member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and founder/landowner of Sacred Stone Camp)
“Indigenous peoples impacted by DAPL and destructive fossil fuel development projects are determined to continue education and advocacy efforts related to bank divestment from companies causing and/or contributing to indigenous human rights abuses in the United States. The Divestment Delegation is an opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of banks’ human rights policy as well as to educate the public on the distinctions and contrasts between the normative human rights standards of Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) and its negative image; a coercive indigenous consultation model practiced by state and non-state actors for natural resource extraction in the U.S. In spite of the human rights violations, it is also a time for indigenous peoples and communities to vision, imagine, nurture, and create new and more just balanced economies.” explains Michelle Cook (Diné/Navajo, human rights lawyer and a founding member of the of the Water Protector Legal Collective at Standing Rock).
""I always knew that I had to prepare for something, a time when the people and land would need me to be ready. That time is now. What will you do when that time has arrived? For those of us, who know that we need to change how all of us live on this earth so that we may live, so our grandchildren who are not yet born may have a chance - we have to stand up, and make our voices and our power known. That time is now."" explains Dr. Sara Jumping Eagle (Oglala Lakota and Mdewakantonwan Dakota pediatrician, living and working on the Standing Rock Reservation, North Dakota).
“We will carry one message from our homelands to financial institutions in Europe: respect indigenous women’s rights to Free, Prior, and Informed Consent. If banks continue to harm our women, children, and elders, we will continue to push divestment and hurt what is most precious to them - their bottom dollar."" explains Jackie Fielder (Mnicoujou Lakota and Mandan-Hidatsa, Campaign Coordinator of the Lakota People's Law Project and organizer with Mazaska Talks).
“Gross human rights violations associated with fossil fuel infrastructure are not limited to the well-publicized fight at Standing Rock. All over the world, indigenous peoples and Mother Earth's finite freshwater resources are threatened by needless fossil fuels projects. We ask the banking industry to take a stand for all people that big oil won't. Stop funding destruction and abuse with consumer money. We want just transition to renewable energy and the lives of your customers to matter more than oil profits.” explains Tara Houska (Anishinaabe, tribal attorney, National Campaigns Director of Honor the Earth, former advisor on Native American affairs to Bernie Sanders).
“With extreme weather from devastating floods to raging fires currently being experienced around the world - it could not be more clear that the Earth is sending us an urgent message that we must take immediate action to keep fossil fuels in the ground - and re-vision and re-build a just and sustainable future for all. In the context of the global Fossil Fuel Divestment movement, the Women's Earth and Climate Action Network is working to ensure that Indigenous and frontline women have the opportunity to speak for themselves, directly to the institutions, governments and policy makers whose decisions are harming their communities and territories through their continued investment in violent, destructive projects. It has never been more vital to listen to the voices of Indigenous women leaders. Together, with their voices at the forefront, we can restore the health of our communities, transition to clean energy, and seek justice for those who continue to be impacted on a daily basis by fossil fuel development at Standing Rock and around the world.” explains Osprey Orielle Lake (Executive Director and Founder of the Women’s Earth and Climate Action Network, WECAN).

","Dutch development bank takes step forward on human rights, but must do more to protect defenders",FMO ,Netherlands,Agua Zarca hydro project ,energy plants - dams,Honduras,"
The Dutch Development Bank (FMO) recently published its Position Statements on human rights, land governance and gender. While the statements represent a step forwards, the bank must develop concrete policies if it is to prevent human rights abuses associated with its projects, and prove that lessons have been learnt from its financing of the Agua Zarca hydro dam linked to the murder of environmental defender Berta Cáceres.
Global Witness Campaigner Ben Leather said: “Recognition of the importance of protecting human rights defenders, and commitments to react when the FMO’s clients are alleged to have acted inappropriately, are welcomed.However, now the bank must articulate precisely how they will protect those who question or oppose their projects. Without this, there are real fears human rights abuses will continue to be associated with FMO’s operations.”
The bank’s Position Statement on Human Rights states: ‘We do not tolerate any activity by our clients that amount to the oppression of, violence towards, or any other violation of the human rights of those who voice their opinion’, committing to ‘take seriously credible allegations that a client has acted inappropriately, examine the veracity, and instigate further action as and where appropriate’. 
It also reiterated its requirement that clients ensure the meaningful consultation of those affected by its project, and the free, prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples.
The bank has also made fresh commitments in response to calls, made by Global Witness and numerous other civil society organisations around the world, for the bank to develop a concrete policy outlining the steps and measures which it will take to protect human rights defenders, and prevent future tragedies from occurring.
FMO has committed to developing an 'early warning system for risk of oppression or violence towards human and environmental rights defenders and those opposing projects FMO invests in'. Global Witness has called for this protocol to contain clear and practical provisions for how to respond in the case of threats against human rights defenders active around their projects. This system should include speaking out when human rights defenders are threatened.
Ben Leather also said: “To prevent threats from emerging in the first place, the bank must make public assurances that an assessment of civil society space and the threats facing human rights defenders needs to form part of the contextual risk assessments made by the bank prior to project financing.”

 Berta Cáceres was murdered in March 2016. She had previously received 33 death threats related to her opposition to the FMO-financed Agua Zarca hydropower dam in Honduras, which threatened the rights of local indigenous peoples. FMO recently divested from the Agua Zarca dam after a global campaign led by international and Honduran civil society organisations, including Berta’s organisation COPINH. Global Witness has consistently campaigned for justice for Berta and, in a recent report, highlighted the responsibility of investors in regards to threats and attacks against land and environmental defenders globally. DESA, the company behind the Agua Zarca dam, deny any involvement in the murder of Berta Cáceres.

",“Responsible” investors under scrutiny for investing in climate-destroying banks ,Citi ,United States,,,,"
As global investors gather in Berlin for the the largest conference on responsible investment hosted by the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UNPRI), major players in the investment community and UNPRI members, including Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street, Norway's Government Pension Fund Global and Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund are under intense scrutiny for fueling climate change through their investments in banks. A briefing published by Rainforest Action Network called “Banks: High Carbon, Hidden Risks” demonstrates that large banks such as JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, HSBC, Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizuho, and Deutsche Bank are pumping billions of dollars into carbon-intensive sectors that include extreme fossil fuels like the Canadian tar sands and commodities like palm oil that are driving tropical deforestation.
None of these banks have disclosed their full greenhouse gas emissions resulting from their financing activities, and many have weak safeguards to prevent further bankrolling the climate crisis and associated ESG risks. In addition to climate risk, their financing of these sectors brings critical environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks such as land conflict and human rights violations, labor abuses, corruption, illegality, pollution, biodiversity loss, and environmental degradation. Banks are not neutral actors and their financing activities are key to shaping a sustainable future, but their contributions to climate change and other harms have long been ignored.  “These so-called “responsible” investors are knowingly putting people’s hard-earned money into investments that are destroying the planet. There’s nothing responsible about that,” said Hana Heineken with Rainforest Action Network.
Demand for improved disclosure is increasing around the world. In June of this year, the industry-led Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) published its long-awaited recommendations, urging companies including banks to disclose to investors, lenders and insurance underwriters about their climate-related financial risks. This month, one hundred investors with assets totaling nearly $2 trillion called on the world’s largest banks to disclose climate-related financial information.
The PRI’s credibility as the preeminent forum for responsible investors is on the line as long as its members continue to allocate their investments into climate-destroying banks. Investors have a responsibility to ensure banks fully disclose their financed emissions and accelerate the transition towards a sustainable, low-carbon economy.

Minneapolis, MN  ",Indigenous Groups Lead Movement to Call on Banks to Drop  Enbridge’s Controversial Line 3 Pipeline ,Bank of America ,United States,,,,"
Today, a coalition of Indigenous, national and international groups join a growing movement placing pressure on financial institutions to drop financially and socially risky projects, delivering a group letter to the 36 banks providing corporate finance to fossil fuel infrastructure giant Enbridge. The groups are calling on the banks to cut business ties with Enbridge Inc. until it stops expanding tar sands operations, one of the most destructive fossil fuels on the planet. Enbridge is the company behind the Line 3 “Replacement” Pipeline project, a controversial project that would cause Indigenous rights abuses and continued contributions towards climate change.
The Line 3 so-called “Replacement” Project is the largest project in Enbridge’s history. The proposal calls for a new pipeline in a new route that would cover over 1,000 miles (1,660 km) from Hardisty, Alberta to Superior, Wisconsin, transporting an average of 760,000 barrels of crude oil from the Alberta tar sands each day, with a capacity of 844,000 barrels per day. The proposed route would pierce the heart of the 1855 Treaty territory, where members of signatory Ojibwe bands retain the rights to hunt, fish, harvest wild rice, perform religious ceremonies, and travel.
“We already saw what happens when a fossil fuel company forces through its project without the consent of directly impacted Native nations -- the opposition against the Dakota Access pipeline sparked worldwide attention, as did the many human rights violations committed upon peaceful demonstrators,” said Tara Houska, National Campaigns Director of Honor the Earth.
First Nations and Indigenous tribes oppose tar sands mining at the source and throughout the pipeline route. Tribal Nations based in Minnesota have joined over 150 First Nations in Canada that are party to the Treaty Alliance Against Tar Sands Expansion.
Tar sands have destroyed forest lands, decimated wild bison populations and increased climate change emissions through mining, transporting and refining processes. Any new pipeline infrastructure, such as the Line 3 “Replacement”, will facilitate new tar sands production — expanded extraction that is incompatible with Canada’s climate commitments and the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement.
This particular project puts sensitive wetlands, watersheds, and treaty rights at risk in Minnesota. The Ojibwe people have guaranteed rights to hunt, fish, and gather wild rice in their traditional territories. A spill would devastate the area, and has the potential to wipe out wild rice beds along its path, one of the most central components of Ojibwe culture and identity.
“Major fossil fuel infrastructure projects like this one require outside funding to be completed, giving banks an outsized role to play in shaping our collective climate future,” said Ruth Breech with Rainforest Action Network. “For too long financial institutions have escaped accountability for the real world consequences of their investments, the time for that impunity has come to an end.”
As a result of the controversy around the project, banks involved in Dakota Access Pipeline have taken steps such as selling their shares in the project finance loan, stopping new business with the pipeline owner, and publicly acknowledging regret over financing the project. The Minnesota Department of Commerce recently condemned the Line 3 Replacement Project, deeming it unnecessary. Banks that finance Enbridge have an upcoming decision in October to decide if they will renew a $1.48 billion line of credit.
Despite the fact that Minnesota has not finalized the legal, public or environmental permitting process for Line 3, Enbridge has already started construction in Canada and Wisconsin. Construction on the 14-mile stretch of the pipeline in Wisconsin has already sparked protests and arrests that are ongoing.
Houska continued, “Enbridge is a 28% shareholder in DAPL. Clearly the company did not learn its lesson, as it is poised to build its Line 3 Project against the will of numerous impacted tribes along its new route. Banks depend on their customers -- we must have agency in how our money is invested. Stop investing in unnecessary, destructive fossil fuel projects and start investing in a green future for the betterment of us all.”

",Greenpeace Investor Briefing: Problematic Pipelines,Barclays ,United Kingdom,Line 3 Pipeline Replacement Project (L3RP) ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,United States,"
A number of banks including JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Canada, TD Bank Group, Barclays, and Wells Fargo risk opposition from Indigenous communities, pressure from civil society groups, and scrutiny from investors as a result of their actual and/or potential involvement in climate damaging and controversial tar sands pipeline projects in Canada and the U.S., according to a new Greenpeace Investor Briefing.
These projects carry many of the same potential risks for banks as arose with the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) including a lack of and/or poor process around Free Prior and Informed Consent from all Indigenous Nations and Tribes along or impacted by the pipeline routes and the risk of contamination of drinking water in the event of a spill.
Some of the banks caught up in DAPL appear to be learning lessons from that controversy. Dutch bank ING which divested from the DAPL project loan has confirmed its tar sands exclusion policy will extend to a prohibition on financing any of the tar sands pipelines. Some lenders who were subject to criticism over DAPL and were participants in previous syndicated credit facilities to Kinder Morgan did not participate in the recent deal to fund the Trans Mountain Expansion project.
However, the willingness of many banks to arrange and/or provide financing for tar sands pipelines suggest that they have failed to learn from the media, investor, and consumer criticism arising from DAPL and appear to be relying on outdated or inadequate risk assessment and mitigation frameworks. These lending decisions will facilitate the expansion of Canada’s tar sands and thereby risk undermining other work by investors, regulators, and some of the same banks to address climate risk.
This briefing outlines the financial and reputation risks banks could face in arranging and providing finance for companies intending to build tar sands pipelines. We suggest questions investors should ask banks to understand whether the various risks are being adequately assessed, mitigated, and managed.
Major risks for bank shareholders

Lack of Free Prior and Informed Consent from all impacted Indigenous Nations and Tribes
Need to ensure adequate environmental & human rights impact assessments
Pipeline spills impacting waterways
Lending decisions incompatible with transition to low carbon economy

",A hundred investors with assets totalling nearly $2 trillion call on world’s largest banks to disclose climate-related financial information,,,,,,"
Demanding action from the world’s largest banks, institutional investors are calling for enhanced disclosure of banks’ climate-related risks and opportunities and of how these are being managed by banks’ boards and senior executives. A recent study estimates that the value at risk under business-as-usual scenarios may be equivalent to a permanent reduction of between 5% and 20% in portfolio value in just over a decade.
100 investors with $1.8 trillion assets under management, including pension funds, asset owners, and asset managers such as Candriam Investors Group and Hermes EOS, are writing to the CEOs of sixty of the world’s largest banks, including Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, HSBC Holdings, JP Morgan Chase, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. and TD Bank.
The letter, coordinated by responsible investment non-profit ShareAction and Boston Common Asset Management, calls for more robust and relevant climate-related disclosure to be supplied to investors on four key areas: climate-relevant strategy and implementation, climate-related risk assessments and management, low-carbon banking products and services, and banks’ public policy engagements and collaboration with other actors on climate change.
There is a growing desire among asset owners and asset managers for more robust climate-related disclosures and risk management from the banking sector. The recent issuance of recommendations by the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) introduces new norms and expectations around disclosure in this space. However, the TCFD framework is voluntary and progress depends on investors pressing for action.
In the wake of the Paris Agreement, the banking sector faces an array of climate-related risks and opportunities. As providers of capital, banks have an essential role to play in ensuring that we meet the Paris Agreement goal of “making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development”. A staggering $93 trillion of investment is required by 2030 to limit global warming to two degrees and the private financial sector has a pivotal role to play in enabling the transition to a low-carbon future.
Isabelle Cabie, Global Head of Responsible Development at Candriam Investors Group, says: “As a result of climate change and the low-carbon transition, banks now face risks and opportunities that are real, wide-ranging, and material to investors. As long-term investors, better disclosure of climate risk allows us to judge how specific banks are performing compared to their peers, and so we ask that banks pay heed to this important call from the investor community.”
Roland Bosch, Associate Director, Engagement at Hermes EOS, says: “In light of the recently issued recommendations of the TCFD, investors are seeking better disclosure from companies in sectors particularly exposed to climate change and global efforts to reduce emissions. We believe that the banking sector can do more to expand its disclosure of how climate risks and opportunities are being assessed and managed.”
Lauren Compere, Managing Director and Director of Shareholder Engagement at Boston Common Asset Management, says: “Limiting global warming to less than a 2 degrees Celsius rise requires a major shift in the way we operate financially and economically. As climate risk becomes recognised as critical to banks, investors want to know whether this risk is being managed well and at the highest levels of the organisation.”
Catherine Howarth, Chief Executive of ShareAction, says: “Millions of people have an interest in how these banks respond to climate change, whether as citizens affected by the frightening physical impacts we hear about almost daily now in the news, as pension savers whose funds invest in these banks, or indeed as customers of these banks. We are hugely encouraged that this substantial group of global institutional investors has come together to press banks for meaningful action on climate-related risks and opportunities.”
The letter is part of a wider investor engagement initiative on banks and climate change. The announcement of this initiative comes days before Climate Week NYC, which brings together companies, investors, governments, and civil society to drive faster progress in addressing climate change.
Earlier this year, ShareAction published “Banking on a Low-Carbon Future”, a guide for investors on engaging with banks on climate change.  In early 2017 Boston Common Asset Management released “On Borrowed Time:  Banks & Climate Change” as an update to their 2015 report highlighting progress but ongoing gaps in the global banking sector’s climate performance.

Jerusalem ",Israel/Palestine: Israeli banks supporting settlements,Bank Hapoalim ,Israel,,,,"
Despite their claims, Israel’s largest banks are not required by domestic law to provide many of the services and financing that help support, maintain, and expand unlawful settlements in the occupied West Bank, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today.
In doing so, these banks violate their international law responsibilities to avoid contributing to human rights and other abuses, including unlawful land seizures, discrimination against Palestinians, and de facto annexation of the West Bank by Israel. Without these banking activities, settlement maintenance and expansion would be more difficult.
“Israeli banks are financing settlement construction and facilitating settlement expansion as a matter of choice, not because they are somehow required to do so under domestic law,” said Sari Bashi, Israel and Palestine advocacy director at Human Rights Watch. “Institutional investors should insist that the banks clarify the extent of their settlement activities and which if any laws would prevent them from ending these activities.”
For years, some foreign investors have raised concerns about the involvement of Israeli banks in furthering settlement maintenance and expansion, including by financing construction projects, providing loans to settlement councils, which are similar to municipalities, and mortgage loans to home-buyers in settlements, and operating bank branches there. Investors such as the United Methodist Church pension fund and the Dutch pension fund PGGM have divested from Israel’s five largest banks, citing their involvement in settlements as being inconsistent with those funds’ human rights policies.
Settlements are unlawful under international humanitarian law. They contribute to the Israeli authorities’ discriminatory regime in the occupied West Bank, restricting and stunting Palestinian development while subsidizing and supporting Israeli settlements built on land unlawfully seized from Palestinians. International humanitarian law forbids an occupying power from using land except for military purposes or for the benefit of the local population living under occupation.
Human Rights Watch reviewed arguments made by Israeli banks that they are obliged by Israeli domestic law to provide these services and therefore cannot cease their activities in settlements.
While Israeli law does require banks to open accounts for qualifying settlement businesses and institutions that apply and requires some service provision to settlers inside bank branches, Human Rights Watch found no domestic law obligating them to provide many of the services they provide inside and to settlements, including providing financing and mortgage loans that facilitate building homes for Israelis, on land unlawfully seized from Palestinians and off-limits to them.
Settlements inherently contribute to serious human rights abuses. The transfer of an occupying power’s civilians into occupied territory constitutes a war crime. Because these abuses are inherent in Israel’s settlement enterprise – businesses do not have the ability to give back the land, allow Palestinians to access it, or dismantle the roadblocks set up to protect settlers – businesses have a responsibility to cease doing businesses in or with Israeli settlements, including locating or carrying out activities inside settlements; financing, administering, or otherwise supporting settlements or settlement-related activities and infrastructure; and contracting to purchase settlement-manufactured goods or produce.
The United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which most large companies accept, require businesses to refrain from contributing to or benefiting from serious violations of human rights or international humanitarian law.
Israeli banks should cease their settlement-related activities. Institutional investors should engage the Israeli banks in which they invest on their settlement-related activities as part of their responsibility to conduct human rights due diligence, Human Rights Watch said. They should determine the extent of the banks’ involvement in settlement-related activities, their future plans, their understanding of the domestic legal framework, and their willingness to ensure that investor funds are not used for these activities. These institutional investors should ensure that their business relationships are free from settlement-related products or investments.
“Israeli banks are making business decisions that contribute to serious human rights abuses,” Bashi said. “Their investors should insist on getting answers about the activities their money is funding.”
The report's recommendations to Institutional Investors in Israeli Banks
As part of their responsibility to conduct heightened human rights due diligence in situations of occupation, institutional investors in Israeli banks should engage the banks in which they invest on their settlement-related activities. They should determine the extent of the banks’ involvement in settlement-related activities, their future plans, their understanding of the domestic legal framework, and the willingness and ability of the banks to verify that investors’ funding is not contributing to or assisting settlement activity. In particular, Human Rights Watch suggests that they ask the following questions of the Israeli banks in which they invest:

Which, if any, domestic law obligations require you to provide services to the settlements and to locate business activities there?
What, if anything, have you done to change those domestic law obligations, to propose interpretations that are consistent with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and/or to seek exemptions from them by making policy proposals to the Bank of Israel?
Have you or will you send an internal policy to the Bank of Israel declining to provide financing services, municipal loans, branch or ATM services and mortgages in Israeli settlements?
Have you or will you submit a request to close your bank branches in Israeli settlements in Area C?
What if any new bank branches or ATMs do you plan to open in Israeli settlements in the West Bank?
What new housing projects in the settlements do you plan to finance?
How many construction projects in the settlements are you currently financing? What is their monetary value?
How many construction projects in settlements have you pre-approved for mortgage loans?
How many mortgage loans are you currently providing for properties in settlements? What is their monetary value?
Please detail any loans or bank guarantees you are providing to settlement local or regional councils and municipalities in the West Bank, beyond the Green Line.
Do you currently hold any government contracts that require you to provide financial services to settlement local or regional councils and municipalities, including loans, to transfer funds or to provide any other support? Please provide details, including their expected expiration (dates) and whether you intend to renew them, if applicable.

These institutional investors should ensure that their business relationships do not contribute to or benefit from serious human rights or IHL violations.

International ",BankTrack has signed the Lofoten Declaration ,,,,,,"
BankTrack joins over 220 organisations from 55 countries in signing a declaration calling for a managed decline of the fossil fuel industry in line with the Paris climate goals. The Lofoten Declaration demands climate leadership that includes an end to exploration and expansion of new fossil fuel reserves.
“The world already has access to more oil, coal, and gas than we can afford to burn if we hope to stay within the Paris climate goals,” says Truls Gulowsen of Greenpeace Norway. “It is imperative that we stop exploring and expanding into new reserves, and instead start thinking about how we are going to have a just transition away from our dangerous dependence on fossil fuels.”
The Lofoten Declaration is a statement of solidarity and support for the inspiring and growing wave of resistance from impacted and frontline communities around the world, who are taking action to defend and protect their lives and livelihoods in the face of fossil fuel extraction and deadly climate impacts.
“We know that we cannot waste time waiting for politicians to catch up,” says Thuli Makama of Oil Change International, speaking from Swaziland. “From Sierra Leone to Mozambique and other parts of the globe, one can’t deny the connection. We stand with and support those across the globe who are rising to protect their communities, one project at a time.”
“Political inaction in the face of the climate crisis is scandalous – and electric cars and carbon pricing simply don’t cut it if you are one of the world’s largest emissions exporters like Norway,” says Hannah McKinnon of Oil Change International. “We are in a deep hole with climate, and we must stop digging ourselves in deeper.”

Poland ",'For and even against it' of Minister Tchórzewski,,,Ostroleka C coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Poland,"

According to wnp.pl, the Minister of Energy said that the planned 1,000 MW unit at the Ostrołęka C Power Plant will be the last coal investment in the Polish power industry. Further comments suggest that Minister Tchórzewski sees the future of energy in the experimental coal gasification technology. The Minister also sees the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The way to limit the share of coal in energy production to 50% by 2050, however, is not to develop clean renewable energy, which celebrates triumphs around the world, but the construction of a nuclear power plant. In turn, the author of the article emphasizes that the construction of Ostrołęka C is not yet decided: ‘Some energy experts unofficially say that this block will not arise’.
On the same day, an article was published on the portal wyborcza.pl, which shows that the government's love for coal has not cooled down. During the same Forum, Minister Tchórzewski said that Poland would not give up its investment in coal and would build new coal-fired power plants. During the conversation about air pollution he also stated that car communication is responsible for terrible air quality in Poland. This is evidently not true – the majority of pollutants are emitted by combustion of low-quality coal and garbage in domestic boilers, however, the Ministry of Energy actively blocks the introduction of coal quality certificates that would eliminate the worst-quality solid fuels from the market.
Completely contradictory statements by Minister Tchótrzewski indicate that the Polish government has no vision of the future of the Polish power industry or fulfillment of commitments under the Paris Agreement on climate protection, which was ratified by 160 countries in 2016, including Poland – concludes Radosław Ślusarczyk from Pracownia na rzecz Wszystkich Istot.

",Equator Banks called upon to Act on Climate Change and Indigenous Peoples’ rights,,,,,,"
65 Environmental, human rights and Indigenous Peoples’ organisations today sent an open letter to the Steering Committee of the Equator Principles Association (EPA), calling for new and much stronger commitments to be made by its 91 member banks on combating climate change and respecting Indigenous Peoples’ rights and territories. 
The letter calls for the Equator Principles to include an explicit commitment to the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees and strive for 1.5 degrees, and as such rule out finance under the Principles for any new fossil fuel extraction, transportation and power projects. The letter also calls for a clear commitment from all Equator Banks to fully respect the internationally recognised rights of Indigenous Peoples anywhere in the world to withhold their consent for projects on their traditional territories, and to rule out financing any projects that violate these rights.
The call comes two months ahead of the next Annual Meeting of the EPA, on October 23 in São Paulo, Brazil. The letter calls upon Equator Banks to decide in Brazil on a full revision process for the Principles, involving external stakeholders, so new commitments on climate change and Indigenous Peoples’ rights can be incorporated in a new set of Principles  in due time. Agreeing on such a revision process would also be in line with a call made earlier this year by ten Equator Banks which proposed a number of changes to the Principles that cannot be accommodated within the current version. 
The Equator Principles are a set of voluntary standards signed by 91 financial institutions, mostly private sector banks, to govern their finance for large infrastructure projects.  They are supposed to strengthen risk management by ensuring that projects being financed are ‘developed in a manner that is socially responsible and reflects sound environmental management practices’. Adopting banks also ‘recognise the importance of climate change, biodiversity, and human rights, and believe negative impacts on project-affected ecosystems, communities, and the climate should be avoided where possible.’
But the NGO open letter calls attention to a series of ‘disaster projects’ that continue to be financed, supposedly in full compliance with the Equator Principles, including the Dakota Access Pipeline in the United States, last year resisted by a historic Native American-led protest camp at Standing Rock, and the Agua Zarca hydroelectric project in Honduras, which led to several assassinations, including the murder of Indigenous human rights defender Berta Cáceres in her home last year for leading Indigenous resistance to the project.
The open letter emphasises that all undersigning organisations place great importance on the Principles, but also warns that “a failure of the Brazil meeting to deliver on these matters will result in a fatal blow to the reputation of the Principles as a global sustainability ‘gold standard’, and in fact position your initiative as one that is actively accommodating the financing of projects that lead to a further deepening of the climate crisis and a deterioration of the plight of Indigenous Peoples”.
The initiative group behind the letter, including BankTrack, Greenpeace, Rainforest Action Network, Sierra Club, Amazon Watch, Mazaska Talks, Market Forces and Divest-Invest, amongst others, today also launched the campaign website, equatorbanksact.org, which lists examples of ‘Equator compliant disaster projects’, and presents a ‘Global Call to Action’ for organisations and individuals to support. The initiative group pledges to increase pressure on the Equator Banks to deliver on this Call right until the October Annual Meeting. 
Johan Frijns, Director of BankTrack, the Netherlands based organisation that took the initiative for the letter, said: “The current Equator Principles date from 2013, before the world agreed in Paris that strong global action is needed to stop catastrophic climate change from further unfolding. The devastating floods in Bangladesh and Texas today show once more that there is no time to lose and that the Equator Principles, a risk management tool after all, must urgently be updated to effectively contribute to managing the biggest risk of all, both to the business of banks and to the planet as a whole. Equator Bank financing of climate disaster projects must end.”
Leila Salazar-López, Executive Director of Amazon Watch, said: “From Standing Rock to the Amazon, Indigenous communities and allies are taking their demands for land rights, sacred site preservation, and environmental protection to the halls of financial power. This campaign is part of the growing movement calling on the financial industry to recognize that our future lies not in short-term profits but in the protection of rights, the environment, the climate, and bold investments in renewable energy. It is high time that the Equator Banks head this call.”
Lindsey Allen, Executive Director of Rainforest Action Network, said: “The Equator Principles recognize bank responsibility for the impacts of projects financed, but in reality they're markedly ineffective in safeguarding the environment and protecting human rights. Banks are still funding projects left and right that exacerbate our world's reliance on extreme fossil fuels — from bankrolling the Dakota Access Pipeline, which violated the right to Free, Prior and Informed Consent from Indigenous Peoples, to the recent financing of Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain Pipeline. These well-financed projects devastate our climate, and infringe on the rights of Indigenous Peoples. The Equator Principles must be strengthened, or they will be recognized as nothing more than window dressing.”
Matt Remle and Rachel Heaton, Co-Founders of Mazaska Talks, said: “The Equator Principles allowed banks to get away with underwriting human rights violations and the desecration of our one and only planet, Unci Maka (Mother Earth). We must bring these banks to heel and continue to divest ourselves and our communities from these heartless banks.”
Nicole Ghio, Senior Campaign Representative with the Sierra Club, said: “It is more evident than ever that the Equator Principles have become woefully out of date, and ensuring that projects are socially and environmentally responsible goes beyond simply signing a piece of paper. While the world came together to endorse the Paris Agreement, and groups like the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures work to address the financial risk of catastrophic climate disruption, the Equator Principles continue to contain loopholes for banks to finance projects that threaten communities and wreak havoc on the environment. Equator Bank support for the Dakota Access Pipeline is just the latest example of the Principles failing to protect Indigenous rights. The Equator Principles must be updated to not only reflect the consensus around the climate crisis but to respect the rights and sovereignty of Indigenous peoples.”
Tara Houska, National Campaigns Director of Honor the Earth, said: “The resistance against fossil fuel expansion and towards just transition to a green economy is growing around the world. The banks that fund destruction and oppression of Indigenous peoples and other at-risk demographics are in the limelight, where they will remain if these banks continue to pay lip service through well-meaning, ineffective policies like the Equator Principles. We want action, not words.”
Michelle Cook Diné, J.D, SJD Candidate, Indigenous Peoples Law and Policy Program, said: ""Indigenous peoples are calling for justice, accountability, and meaningful remedy for human rights abuses by extractive industries funded and or facilitated by banks and financial institutions in the territories they traditionally use or occupy. They are demanding that banks make real their commitments to the Equator Principles by highlighting the on the ground efficacy of those Principles in the lives of Indigenous peoples. The time for banks to be accountable to Indigenous peoples and the world community for human rights abuses they facilitate is long over-due. This is an opportunity for the Equator Association to take notice, listen, and change the Principles.""
Julien Vincent, Executive Director of Market Forces, said: “Despite committing to support the goal of holding global warming to less than two degrees, Australia’s banks have continued to finance the expansion of the fossil fuel sector, helping to increase the world’s output of greenhouse pollution by billions of tonnes. Banks need to realise that they play a key role in determining whether or not we keep a lid on global warming and change their policies and practices to avoid runaway climate change.”

",Shareholders move to force Commbank to manage climate risk,Commonwealth Bank ,Australia,,,,"
Shareholders have lodged a first-of-its-kind resolution with Commonwealth Bank that would embed climate change risk management into its constitution. It comes a month after shareholders began court proceedings against the bank over its failure to consider climate change as a material business risk.
The resolution, coordinated by environmental finance group Market Forces, would ensure Directors operate the company in a manner consistent with the goal of holding global warming to below two degrees.
CommBank remains exposed to a myriad of physical, transition and legal risks from climate change, exacerbated by its continued heavy lending to fossil fuels and acknowledged lack of consideration of risks such as the impact of sea level rise on the property market.
“CommBank has made it perfectly clear it lacks either the intent or capacity to adequately manage climate risk”, said Market Forces Executive Director Julien Vincent.
“Avoiding runaway climate change will be fundamental to economic and financial stability over the coming decades. CommBank is Australia’s largest company and embedding climate change risk management into its constitution will increase its resilience and position the bank to take full advantage of the opportunities created by the transformation to a low carbon economy”.
Two weeks ago Commonwealth Bank released its first ever Climate Change Policy Position Statement, a one-page document lacking substantial commitment to reduce the bank’s support for fossil fuels.
Research from Market Forces shows that since Commonwealth Bank first committed to support the goal of holding global warming to below two degrees, it has loaned $6 billion to fossil fuels, more than four times its renewable energy lending.
It has also financed several new fossil fuel projects that, over their lifetimes, would add another 2.8 billion tonnes of CO2 to the atmosphere, effectively cancelling out Australia’s 2005-2030 greenhouse gas abatement target twice over.
“CommBank’s public pledge to support a world limited to two degrees warming is impossible to reconcile with its continued multi-billion dollar lending to highly-exposed fossil fuel projects and dismal climate change policy”, said Mr Vincent.
“As such a huge part of Australia’s economy, CommBank needs to take the common sense approach of embedding climate change risk management into its DNA.”

Poland ",Capacity market will not help coal - new power plants are like castles built on sand,,,Ostroleka C coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Poland,"

Coal units in Europe turned out to be sand castles – says the article, which appeared on 13 August at rp.pl. Of the 49 GW coal power planned in Europe in 2005-2008, only 21% were actually built. 37.8 GW were abandoned and 1.1 GW remains on paper. In the UK no coal unit was created, in Poland 75% of projects were abandoned and in Germany - 70%. Most of the 12 built power plants suffered serious impairment which worsened the financial position of the corporations that own them. The author of the article points out that new coal investments are no longer profitable, which also applies to the power plants planned in Poland: ""Nobody even tries to hide that these blocks without a support mechanism, the so called capacity market, will not be feasible."" Even before such a development, NGOs, including the Stop North Power Coalition, had been saying this for years. In the meantime, it is clear from the article that despite the logic and the market situation, ENERGA's determination to carry out the coal unit in Ostrołęka – even without regulatory support – is growing.
This seems to be confirmed by the statement of ENERGA Group Vice-President on 9 August. Jacek Kościelniak claims that there are no threats to the construction of the Ostrołęka C power plant. ""We have the opportunity to comment on the draft law . We hope that they will be taken into account, and the entire capacity market law will also take into account the case of the Ostrołęka C power plant."" Does this mean that the capacity market for which Polish citizens will pay is set to build unprofitable power plants?
The vice president also claims that Ostrołęka C will emit ""trace amounts of CO2"" which is a bizarre claim in the case of a coal-fired power plant. The European Commission has proposed that from 2020 the power market and other support methods for power plants only concern installations emitting less than 550 g CO2 per 1 KWh, which we read in the article titled “Capacity market will not save the coal”. The author of the article emphasizes that the capacity market will not stop the development of RES or save Polish coal, and the power plants themselves will work less and less. ""If anyone in the government believes that the capacity market will provide a bright future for Polish coal, it means they are living in the world of illusions,"" she concludes. In this light, the question is whether the ENERGA Board and Shareholders live in the world of illusion as well?
The ENERGA Board has repeatedly stressed that the capacity market is essential to ensure the viability of the Ostrołęka C, without which it will generate financial losses. This information was included in Eurobond prospectus from February 2017 and in the response of the Management Board to the shareholders' questions in July. However, after a few weeks, the media were informed that the construction of Ostrołęka C will take place regardless of whether or not the Capacity Market Act is implemented. ENERGA proves in this way that it does not have a long-term strategy and does not treat its shareholders seriously giving them vital information that turn out to be outdated only a few weeks later.

Nijmegen ",BankTrack statement on Dakota Access Pipeline lawsuit filed by ETP/ETE,,,Dakota Access Pipeline ,energy distribution | oil and gas,United States,"
BankTrack has taken note of the outrageous allegations in the lawsuit that ETP/ETE has filed against BankTrack, Greenpeace International, Greenpeace Inc., Greenpeace Fund, Inc., Earth First!, and other organizations and individuals that together opposed the Dakota Access Pipeline Project.
BankTrack vehemently rejects all accusations brought forward by ETP/ETE. We consider it perfectly within our right and our stated mission to inform the general public on potential or actual negative social, environmental and human rights impacts of projects -to be- financed by private sector banks. We also consider it competely within our right to bring information on such projects, including indicators of widespread public concern, to the attention of banks, so that they can make their own assessment of the materiality of this information, and let this weigh into their own decision making processes.
BankTrack considers the lawsuit an attempt of ETP/ETE to silence civil society organisations, and to curb their crucial role in helping to foster business conduct globally that protects the environment, recognises the rights and interests of all stakeholders, and respects human rights. This attempt is bound to fail.
Contrary to what is stated, BankTrack has not made any financial gain from our campaign work on the Dakota Access Pipeline.  We are fully transparent on our funding sources, which can be found here, with our audited financial report for 2016 available here.
Further statements will follow. See also this information page
***
The press release from ETP/ETE alleges that ""this group of co-conspirators (the ""Enterprise"") manufactured and disseminated materially false and misleading information about Energy Transfer and the Dakota Access Pipeline (""DAPL"") for the purpose of fraudulently inducing donations, interfering with pipeline construction activities and damaging Energy Transfer's critical business and financial relationships. The Complaint also alleges that the Enterprise incited, funded, and facilitated crimes and acts of terrorism to further these objectives.  It further alleges claims that these actions violated federal and state racketeering statutes, defamation, and constituted defamation and tortious interference under North Dakota law.""

Poland ",ENERGA avoids answering inconvenient questions,,,Ostroleka C coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Poland,"



ENERGA portraits itself as having the ambitions to be the Polish leader on renewable energy market. Developing renewable energy, though, is not enough to secure reduction in greenhouse gases emissions. This can be achieved under one condition: new RES capacity replaces energy generated from coal combustion. Otherwise emissions of GHGs and pollutants remains unchanged or even increase. Construction of the Ostrołeka C unit will certainly cause an increase in ENERGA’s emissions as capacity of the already existing units is relatively small.
ENERGA does not respond to a question on how exactly it is going to achieve reduction in emissions from its existing coal units in short (by 2030) and long term (by 2050) in order to fulfil obligations stemming from the Paris Agreement on Climate Protection ratified by Poland as well as from the EU climate policy. By avoiding the answer ENERGA confirms that its investment strategy to be short-termed. Ignoring the fact that the strategy must be compatible with the binding Agreement in medium- and long-term should serve as red alert to any long-term investor of ENERGA.
ENERGA underlines the need to ensure Poland’s Energy security. It must be noted that coal investments are what threatens it. Energy security can be achieved by diversification of energy mix (including investing in renewable energy) and building infrastructure allowing cross-border flows of electricity within Europe, not construction of new coal-fired units. It is vital to realize that due to dwindling reserves of domestic coal and costs of their exploitation the units we are now building are going to burn coal imported from abroad, most probably from Russia.
ENERGA confirmed that construction of the Ostrołęka C unit will be profitable on the sole condition of it being granted subsidies such as the capacity market. However, after few weeks it informed in the media that the coal unit will be built regardless of introducing the capacity market act.
This mean that ENERGA:

1) does not have a long-term strategy and the information of key investment can change within a month,

2) does not treat its shareholders seriously providing them with information which becomes outdated in few weeks time.
It is not known in what way would the company use the financial aid schemes and after how many years (if at all) would the Ostrołęka C unit have become viable on a stand-alone basis. ENERGA did not responded to a question on the possible impacts of not introducing the capacity market or other aid schemes on the company’s profitability. Neither does it say under what circumstances the company and its shareholders’ investments in modernization of 200 MWe units required by the newly introduced BREF/BAT would recoup.
The Board of ENERGA avoided answering to the question on the dividend that could be paid to shareholders if the Ostrołęka C project was abandoned.
Meanwhile, in times of global withdrawal from coal and the revolution in renewable energy it is the decision not to be involved in a political project of regulatory uncertainty (capacity market, winter package) may well turn out to be the most beneficial for both, the company and the Polish society.

","Financiers of pulp and paper industry projects will cause environmental and social harm, says new report",ABN AMRO ,Netherlands,,,,"
The Environmental Paper Network* (EPN) has published In the Red, an assessment of bank policies for financing pulp and paper companies. This assessment reveals that the banks most deeply involved in the pulp and paper sector do not have policies that are fit for purpose to avoid financing projects and companies that cause environmental and social harm.
The assessment studied how ready the financial sector is to manage the environmental and social risks of financial involvement with the pulp and paper industry. It is a benchmark assessment carried out by a team of researchers from several countries, which evaluates the pulp and paper policies of 42 private banks against the requirements set out in 2016 in Green Paper, Red Lines.
The Red Lines are environmental and social criteria, which articulate minimum requirements that pulp and paper companies must meet before investment in them is considered. Unless pulp and paper mills and their financiers fulfil these requirements, they are highly likely to cause unacceptable social and environmental harm and become the target of campaigns by civil society organisations.  Member organisations of EPN therefore expect financiers to stay clear if their client pulp and paper companies are unable to meet the minimum requirements.
Mandy Haggith, co-ordinator of the Environmental Paper Network’s pulp finance working group, said: “The results of our assessment reveal that bank policies are extremely disappointing. Unfortunately none of the banks we assessed manages to thoroughly protect itself from clients breaching the Red Lines. Indeed for most of the Red Lines, the vast bulk of banks are at best only partly protected. We can only conclude that the banking sector does not have policies that are fit for purpose to avoid irresponsible investment in damaging pulp and paper projects and companies. We urge all banks to review their policies for involvement in this sector.”
* EPN is a global network of more than 140 non-governmental organisations, focussing on pulp and paper sustainability issues, all of which endorse the Global Paper Vision.

","Statement by Friends of the Earth Europe, Global Witness and ShareAction on the interim recommendations of the High-Level Expert Group on Sustainable Finance",,,,,,"
The High-Level Expert Group on Sustainable Finance (HLEG) established in late 2016 by the European Commission presents its interim recommendations to make finance sustainable in a public hearing on July 18th. We urge the European Commission (EC) to build upon those recommendations, but also call upon the Expert Group to be bolder and more courageous in the final recommendations to be issued at the end of this year.
Related documents:
High-Level Expert Group on Sustainable Finance interim report 
Statement by Share Action, Friends of the Earth Europe and Global Witness 
The signatories to this statement share strong concerns that the finance industry in the European Union (EU) is not sufficiently regulated. As such, it is free to contribute to real environmental harm and human rights abuses in investment projects within and outside the EU. The regulatory framework to date leaves the finance industry with ample leeway to define its own risk, and is characterized by self-regulation and voluntary action on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) related issues. Global Witness and Friends of the Earth Europe issued a briefing underlining concern that a voluntary approach to financial regulation is inadequate. Today’s finance industry is not geared towards contributing to sustainable development and it repeatedly fails to contribute fully to the real economy. We have previously called on the European Union to adopt and implement binding regulation to address these concerns. These recommendations are laid out in a briefing issued together with other members of the Regulate Finance Coalition of NGOs in June 2017.
The creation of the HLEG is a welcome step by the EC. We also welcome the commitment made by the EC, announced in its mid-term review of the Capital Markets Union (CMU) to take concrete action to follow up on the recommendations issued by the HLEG in early 2018.  
The HLEG interim report contains many positive points including:

A recognition that a sustainable development model requires ensuring “environmental, social and governance factors are at the heart of financial decision-making”.
Language effectively calling for greater disclosure by firms and financial institutions which would help “managers, investors and other stakeholders to analyse ESG risks and opportunities”.
A call for action by regulatory authorities to “make clear to all involved in the investment and lending chain that managing ESG risks is integral to fulfilling fiduciary duty” and building on EU legal texts so that financial actors are clear that fiduciary duty includes action to integrate ESG considerations in their decision-making processes.

The report does discuss the need to define sustainability. However, whilst the report appears to hint at the lack of definition of the ESG acronym it does not lay out sufficient steps to come to such a definition. The report should also go further and ask for binding regulation to ensure that financial actors are obliged to recognize ESG harm as risks; to take decisive action to avoid ESG harm and to hold unscrupulous financial actors that fail to exercise due diligence to avoid ESG risks and/or seek to benefit from such harm to account, including in legal proceedings.
We are concerned that the EC has repeatedly stated that climate change issues are the priority thereby possibly relegating social and governance and human rights issues to a secondary position. Whilst decisive action by the EU on climate change is welcome, we firmly believe that action on other environmental, social and governance issues, such as human rights and deforestation, should not be side-lined. We fear that this position could herald a reluctance by the EC to fully endorse interim report recommendations related to the full integration of binding ESG regulations in a sustainable finance strategy.
If the HLEG is to develop an understanding of sustainable finance it must be given the space to develop a strong, holistic definition of ESG in the following minimum terms:

An emerging definition should recognize that environmental issues are broader than those relating to climate, including those causing environmental destruction such as deforestation. Reference should be made to international environmental treaties ratified by EU Member States. 
Social matters should be understood as incorporating human rights and labour rights standards as stated in the international human rights treaties signed by EU Member States, including United Nations, regional and International Labour Organisation treaties, as well as a focus on aggressive tax planning/arrangements and strong anti-corruption measures.
Governance matters should not be understood only as an internal issue of company management. Instead they should encompass both internal management matters together with the due diligence responsibilities of companies to avoid causing and benefiting from harm and mitigating any negative social and environmental impacts.

The Rio and Stockholm Conferences  made clear that sustainable development is dependent on three central interlinked components: environment, development and human rights. The 2030 Agenda also imposes upon the EU a duty to pay equal attention to the social, environmental, economic and governance dimensions of sustainable development. As such, the recommendations from the HLEG should ensure that investors avoid all significant ESG related harm. 
The development of a sustainable finance strategy should be based on a broad interpretation of ESG risks and impacts. ESG factors have been recognized by much of the investment world as crucial to ensuring that investments support sustainable and ethical projects.  Binding regulations will create a level playing field and help investors avoid the risks associated with ESG related problems.
ESG understood in this way should be incorporated in all EU financial regulation complemented by a stand-alone piece of legislation covering the whole financial sector. The development of a strong EU sustainable finance strategy could provide important guidance for the approval of such legislation. Such legislation should develop:

Greater transparency requirements on financial industry companies to publish clear and full information on any potential ESG risks involved in any investment process and what due diligence measures have been undertaken to avoid, prevent, mitigate and account for negative ESG impacts. 
Greater accountability of the finance industry entities to individuals or groups who may be impacted by company operations in which they have invested. Finance industry companies which have failed to exercise due diligence to avoid such impacts or which have deliberately sought to benefit from them should be made accountable in criminal or civil proceedings as appropriate. Provisions should be put in place to ensure that communities outside the EU that have faced the brunt of such harm are able to bring criminal proceeding or civil lawsuits for environmental damage or human rights abuses before courts in the EU. This would be in line with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights which call on states to remove barriers to effective legal remedy. 
Requirements to oblige financial industry companies to exercise due diligence to avoid ESG harm.

Notes:
 
 “Priority action 6 The Commission will decide by Q1 2018 at the latest on the concrete follow up that it will give to the recommendations of the High Level Expert Group on Sustainable Finance. In particular, it shall already set in motion work to prepare measures to improve disclosure and better integrate sustainability/ESG in rating methodologies and supervisory processes, as well as in the investment mandates of institutional  investors and asset managers. It will also develop an approach for taking sustainability considerations into account in upcoming legislative reviews of financial legislation.”
 The report draws attention to the fact that EU regulations do not appear to explain what is meant by ESG:“To date, regulatory standards for sustainable products remain limited to general provisions on ESG integration within EU regulations for  financial products (for example, ELTIF, EuSEF, UCITS, AIMFD, MiFID II, PRIIPS, etc.). These provisions do not specify what the integration of ESG factors means, and very different approaches are mixed under the same vocabulary (SRI, ESG, sustainable, green and social). This does not enable market organisations to reject investment choices and should be clarified.”
 These would include the international treaties included in the United Nations Portal on Multilateral Environmental Agreements (InforMEA): https://www.informea.org/
 United Nations Conference on Human Development 1972 and the UN Conference on Environment and Development 1992.
 The United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment refer to the incorporation of ESG in investment decisions: https://www.unpri.org/about/what-is-responsible-investment and https://www.unpri.org/about/the-six-principles

",New report: HSBC a ‘crucial link in the chain’ of Palestinian oppression says War on Want,Barclays ,United Kingdom,,,,"
Some of the UK’s best known banks and financial institutions are complicit in Israel’s crimes against the Palestinian people according to a new report by War on Want. The report, Deadly Investments: UK bank complicity in Israel’s crimes against the Palestinian people, exposes the business relationship between UK banks and financial institutions, and 19 companies known to supply Israel with weapons and technology used in the abuse of Palestinian human rights, including war crimes.
UK banks and financial institutions examined in the report hold shares worth over GBP 10.8 billion in companies that sell weapons, military equipment and technology to Israel, which is used to oppress Palestinians. Additionally, some of them facilitate loans to these companies. HSBC owns shares worth over GBP 831 million in military and technology companies such as BAE Systems, Boeing, Caterpillar and Raytheon that sell weapons and equipment to Israel. Raytheon’s “bunker buster” bombs were used by Israel to target civilian homes during its 2014 assault on Gaza, while Caterpillar’s specially modified bulldozers are used to demolish Palestinian homes in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory.
War on Want’s senior military and security campaigner, Ryvka Barnard, said: “UK high street banks are key players in the UK-Israel arms trade and make these deadly deals possible. Banks like HSBC are a crucial link in the chain of oppression, facilitating and profiting from the brutal military repression of Palestinians.""
The report comes hot on the heels of UN guidance to the banking sector, published this month, clarifying that banks and financial institutions have responsibilities to “avoid causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts” and “to prevent or mitigate adverse human rights impacts that are directly linked to their operations, products or services by their business relationships”.
Barnard, continued: “HSBC makes much of its ethical credentials yet its contempt for human right rights couldn’t be starker.  HSBC’s deals with arms companies make it complicit in the suffering endured by Palestinians. War on Want is calling for banks to divest from, and stop facilitating loans to, companies that sell weapons and security services to Israel. We also repeat our call for the UK government to implement a two-way arms embargo on Israel.”
Campaigners have already taken up the campaign to pressure HSBC to end its complicity in human rights abuse. At the beginning of July 2017, campaigners held pickets outside HSBC branches in London, Brighton, Manchester and several other UK cities. Additionally, over 4,500 individuals have emailed the CEO of HSBC in reference to the findings of the report. War on Want expects this number to rise significantly as the report is published.

",Controversial hydropower project that led to murder of land defender Berta Cáceres halted as funders forced to pull out,FMO ,Netherlands,Agua Zarca hydro project ,energy plants - dams,Honduras,"
Global Witness welcomes the news that the Dutch and Finnish development banks behind the deeply controversial Agua Zarca hydropower dam in Honduras - which led to the murder of acclaimed land defender Berta Cáceres - have withdrawn their backing for the project.
But the organisation warns that the banks urgently need to commit to concrete action to protect environmental and land defenders if they are to ensure future financing does not contribute to the abuse and violence suffered by thousands of activists every year.
The banks’ move follows years of pressure by COPINH, the indigenous movement headed up by Berta Cáceres, and by Global Witness and other national and international groups.
Billy Kyte, campaign leader at Global Witness, said:
“We welcome the news that the international investors behind the Agua Zarca dam are finally pulling out. However, these same investors were silent when dozens of death threats were made against renowned Honduran environmentalist Berta Cáceres, who was then murdered for protecting her community from this destructive project.
“Investors have a duty to speak out when activists opposing their projects are threatened. They need to put in place proper policies to protect environmental defenders, and freeze their investments if local populations are threatened or attacked. People’s lives depend on it.”    
The Netherlands Development Finance Institution (FMO) and Finnish Fund for Industrial Cooperation (Finnfund) say they have withdrawn from the project in a move 'intended to reduce international and local tensions in the area'.
As a national development bank, FMO has an obligation under international law to respect the rights of those affected by the activities it finances and support those who raise their voices in dissent. It must now take concrete action to ensure cases like Agua Zarca never happen again, including outlining how it will support defenders through the human rights policies it is currently drawing up.
More than 120 people have died in Honduras since 2010, according to Global Witness research, making it the most dangerous country per capita to be a land or environmental defender. In 2015 185 people globally were killed for defending their land, rivers and forests against destructive industries whilst countless others have been murdered, threatened, imprisoned or criminalised in the pursuit of their rights.
Two of the eight men detained in relation to Cáceres’ killing were ex-employees of the Honduran company building the dam, Desarrollos Energéticos SA (DESA). Despite this, FMO has said that 'the lenders note that no proven connection has been established between DESA and allegations regarding any illegality'. DESA has denied any involvement in the murder of Berta Cáceres or in any other violence linked to the Agua Zarca dam.

Poland ",Campaign for green and healthy Kurpie region launched!,,,Ostroleka C coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Poland,"

What are the reasons why Ostrołęka C should not be built?
Every coal-fired power plant, including the newest and most modern, pollutes the environment and negatively impacts human health. Such power plants are major source of particular matter, Sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides – invisible but deadly substances. Although the power plant would be built in the Rzekuń municipality, its impact would cover neighboring voivodships as emissions can travel hundreds kilometers. According to experts on human health, the pollution generated by Ostrołęka C could cause approx. 900 premature deaths and over 1 300 cases of bronchitis and 50 000 asthma attacks in children.
Learn more at Stop Ostrołęka C campaign website 
Meanwhile the investors keep hiding the real impacts of the Ostrołęka C power plant on air quality and health. Analysis of their documents revealed that the integrated permit lacks information on emissions of heavy metals and particular matter PM 2.5. The power plan does not meet the newest standards of Sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions for such facilities. Taking into consideration its significant threat to human health and its lack of profitability unless public aid is provided (which means our tax money), we need to question soundness of building this power plant.
Is coal worth putting our health and lives at risk as we do have another choice: we can generate clean energy from renewable sources? It is up to us what future we choose for Poland and Kurpie: years in the shadow of huge coal power plant or sustainable development, energy safety and high quality of life in clean environment.
We invite you to join our campaign!

Berlin ",New database reveals world’s biggest coal plant developers,,,Adani ,energy plants - coal | mining - coal  | oil and gas,India,"
Today, the environmental NGO urgewald and its partners reveal which companies are at the forefront of plans to expand the world’s coal-fired power capacity by a staggering 42.8%. urgewald’s previous in-depth research played a key role in initiating the coal divestment actions of the Norwegian Government Pension Fund and the insurance company Allianz.


Currently, over 1,600 new coal plants and units are planned or under development in 62 countries.  If built, they would add over 840,000 MW to the global coal plant fleet.
“The companies pushing forward this glut of new coal infrastructure pose a threat to us all, as their projects would bury our chances of keeping global warming well below 2°C,” said urgewald’s director, Heffa Schuecking. “When we began our research, we realised that most banks and investors don’t have a clue who the world’s top coal plant developers are. Our new database closes this gap by providing a ‘Who’s who’ of the global coal plant pipeline. It is the first forward-looking divestment tool for banks and investors and we hope it will be widely used.”
The database urgewald has published at the www.coalexit.org website identifies the top 120 companies responsible for two thirds of the new coal power stations planned around the globe. All in all, these 120 companies aim to build over 550,000 MW of new coal power plants – this is approximately 2.5 times greater than India’s entire coal plant fleet.
KEY FINDINGS
Coal ‘frontier’ countries
It is especially worrying that many new coal plants are planned in ‘frontier’ countries, which have little or no coal-fired capacity, and will thus lock them into a coal-dependent future for decades to come.
“Egypt does not have a single coal-fired power station, but if companies like Shanghai Electric, ACWA Power and Orascom have their way, over 17,000 MW of coal-fired capacity will be installed in the country,” said Schuecking.
Pakistan’s coal capacity is slated to rise from 190 MW to 15,278 MW. In Bangladesh, coal-fired capacity will grow from 250 MW to 15,960 MW, and in Myanmar from 160 MW to 5,130 MW.
In total, coal plant developers aim to build new plants in 14 countries which presently have zero coal-fired capacity. In 19 further countries increases of over 100% of coal-fired capacity are in the pipeline.


“In most of these countries, there is massive public resistance to these plans,” says Lidy Nacpil, coordinator of the Asian People’s Movement on Debt and Development (APMDD). “Banks and investors need to blacklist companies that are driving ever new countries and regions into a destructive cycle of coal dependency.”


For a complete list of coal power expansion plans in ‘frontier’ countries, see: https://urgewald.org/country-list-coal-expansion-march2017
Ranking the biggest coal plant developers
The world’s largest coal plant developer, India’s National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), is planning to build over 38,000 MW of new coal capacity in India and Bangladesh.
Next in line are the Chinese companies SPIC (31,587 MW), China Datang (28,945 MW), Shenhua (26,014 MW), China Huadian (25,810 MW), China Huaneng (20,750 MW) and China Guodian (17,250 MW). Overall, Chinese companies account for 43% of the projects in urgewald’s database, but around 1/6 of these projects are located outside of China.
“If the Chinese government truly wants to position itself as a global climate leader, it needs to rein in its state-owned companies that are flooding the world with new coal power plants,” says Trusha Reddy, Coordinator of the International Coal Network.
Companies from other Asian countries such as South Korea and Japan also play a prominent role in the coal power pipeline. Japan’s Marubeni is the 26th largest coal plant developer worldwide and is involved in joint ventures totalling over 13,000 MW of new coal in 9 countries. Among these are many projects in ‘frontier’ countries like Botswana, Egypt, Mongolia and Myanmar.


The largest African coal plant developer is South Africa’s Eskom, which is ranked 15th, and the largest European coal plant developer is Poland’s PGE, which is ranked 30th in urgewald’s database.
International investment in the global coal plant pipeline
“Although the majority of coal plant developers are from Asia, international banks and investors from Europe, North America and Australia all play an important role in financing their dirty business,” said Heffa Schuecking.
Bonds and shares of top coal developers such as NTPC, KEPCO, Marubeni, Adani or China Resources are routine positions in the portfolios of large international investors and banks. Even institutions that have already taken steps to divest from the coal industry such as AXA, Allianz or CalSTRS still hold investments in coal plant developers.
“What we’ve learned from our research, is that coal-based revenue or power generation thresholds fail to capture many of the coal plant developers,” explained Schuecking.
Only 1/3 of the top coal plant developers have a coal share of revenue that is higher than 30%, the divestment threshold applied by Allianz and the Norwegian Government Pension Fund.
The remaining 2/3 are companies that are either very diversified like Marubeni or come from other sectors, such as the Vietnamese oil company PetroVietnam or the Malaysian company ToyoInk. ToyoInk is an especially bizarre case. The company currently manufactures printing inks for the Malaysian packaging industry, but has decided that its future lies in the coal plant market.
“This exemplifies why we developed this database,” said Schuecking. “Many of these companies are not traditional coal companies and would otherwise not be recognised by the finance industry. Ours is the first list that names and shames the companies whose coal power plans are paving the road towards climate chaos.”
For financial institutions, saying ‘Yes’ to the Paris Climate Agreement must mean saying ‘No’ to coal plant developers.

Toronto ",Dutch bank ING the latest to reject financing of Kinder Morgan pipeline,ING ,Netherlands,Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion project (TMEP) ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,Canada,"
Dutch bank ING has publicly stated that it will not finance oil pipeline projects from the Canadian tar sands, including the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain Expansion, Keystone XL, Energy East, and Line 3 Expansion pipelines. The move comes as a response to a letter sent by 20 Indigenous and environmental groups asking the bank to refrain from financing Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain Expansion pipeline. The letter highlighted the proposed pipeline’s detrimental impact on the climate and its violations of Indigenous rights.
Alex Speers-Roesch, an Oil Campaigner with Greenpeace Canada:
“This is the latest reminder that financing pipelines that violate Indigenous rights, threaten water and undermine action on climate change is bad for business and carries considerable risk. The historic protests against the Dakota Access pipeline last year hit the finance community hard and shifted the landscape for controversial fossil fuel projects. More and more banks and investment funds are realizing that in order to preserve their reputations and long-term financial performance, pipelines are not the way to go. Banks like TD, who stake their reputations on their sustainability policies, should expect growing resistance if they continue to fund environmentally-poisonous pipelines like Kinder Morgan.”
Diana Best, Senior Climate and Energy Campaigner with Greenpeace USA:
“The world has moved on since these tar sands projects were first proposed. Projects like the Keystone XL pipeline have been fought and rejected by broad, diverse coalitions, and they will continue to carry huge risk to their investors. This move by ING is the most recent indication that the financial community has begun see that risk. We expect banks like JPMorgan Chase, who have historically backed tar sands pipelines, to come clean with themselves and their investors and cease funding all dirty, doomed tar sands projects.”
Jason Opeña Disterhoft, Senior Climate and Energy Campaigner with Rainforest Action Network:
“ING’s new commitment represents a significant step forward, in recognition of the devastating Indigenous rights and climate impacts of tar sands oil. While there remains an urgent need to prohibit financing for the companies behind tar sands projects, ING's revised policy makes it the current leader among global banks in moving away from a sector which has absolutely no place in a 1.5 degree world in which human rights are fully respected. Moving forward, banks must stop their business-as-usual funding for extreme fossil fuels. Whether or not they finance tar sands oil will be a key test of their seriousness on climate change and human rights.”
Tara Houska, National Campaigns Director with Honor the Earth: 
“ING’s commitment against project level financing of tar sands is a significant step in the right direction. As we saw at Standing Rock, oil companies are willing to engage in gross human rights violations to keep the dying fossil fuels industry going. We are looking to banks to take on a leadership role and fully divest from funding tar sands and the companies that continue to extract the dirtiest fossil fuel in the world. As consumers, we should have agency over how our money is invested. This is our collective future at stake -- transition to a green economy is long  overdue.”
ING previously contributed $137 million to one credit line to Kinder Morgan and has underwritten millions in bonds. The bank’s updated policy indicates that its prior prohibition of investments in “transactions directly linked to mining, exploration and upgrading of oil sands” has been extended to include pipelines, specifically naming Trans Mountain, Keystone XL, Energy East, and Line 3 Expansion. In March, ING pulled its $120 million loan stake from the Dakota Access Pipeline after meeting with members of the Standing Rock Sioux.
The ING news comes on the heels of Sweden’s largest pension fund, AP7, announcing that it will divest from TransCanada on the grounds that its proposed pipelines in Canada and the US are incompatible with the Paris Agreement. It also follows Kinder Morgan’s disappointing IPO in May, during which the company was forced to respond to Greenpeace Canada’s challenge to its prospectus. Kinder Morgan Canada’s stock has performed poorly since.

Washington, DC ","150,000 People Representing more than $4 Billion Call on Banks to Defund Tar Sands Pipelines",Bank of America ,United States,Dakota Access Pipeline ,energy distribution | oil and gas,United States,"
Since the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) struggle began last year, banks have been under increased scrutiny and pressure around their financing of fossil fuel companies, pipelines and other infrastructure. Most recently, a number of Indigenous-led and other grassroots groups have called on banks, consumers, investors, businesses, pension funds and governments to protect water, Indigenous sovereignty and the climate by defunding DAPL and four proposed new tar sands pipelines.
Advocates argue that an effective way to shut down or prevent construction of pipelines like DAPL, Keystone XL, Trans Mountain, Line 3, Energy East, and other oil and gas infrastructure is to bring public attention to — and pull investments out of — the large banks that provide the loans, bond sales, and other forms of financial support that fossil fuel projects depend on. Toward that end, 150,000 people have signed an online petition targeting the 17 biggest lenders to the companies behind one or more of the 5 pipelines named above: Bank of America, Barclays, Citi, Crédit Agricole, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan Chase, Mizuho, MUFG, RBC, SMBC, ScotiaBank, TD Bank, Wells Fargo, CIBC, BNP Paribas, and Bank of Montreal.1
A full breakdown of assets pledged to divest from each target bank is at the end of this release. Highlights include:
● Over 14,000 Bank of America Customers with assets of more than $750 million

● More than 13,000 Wells Fargo customers with assets over $882 million

● Nearly 10,000 JP Morgan Chase Customers with assets of more than $540 million

● Over 5,000 Citibank customers with assets of nearly $225 million

● Customers from every one of the target banks are represented, and thousands reported accounts with more than one bank.

● Thousands of customers report already closing accounts and moving assets to credit unions, local banks and fossil free banks like Amalgamated and Aspiration.
“So many people have been dissatisfied with Wall Street banks for so long,” said Vanessa Green, Director of DivestInvest Individual, “The vitality of the resistance to DAPL and other pipelines helps exponentially more people get over the hump of inaction. People are seeing that small personal level changes add up in the collective effort to hold banks accountable and right some wrongs.”
Earlier this year, community members and their elected officials reported moving $5.4 billion out of banks invested in DAPL. Additionally, 15 not-for-profit organizations representing over 13 million supporters announced an end to doing business with tar sands pipeline financing banks. Around the world, over 58,000 individuals and 700 colleges, churches, foundations and other institutions are divesting another $5 trillion from fossil fuel companies.
“Our team is committed to being consistent with what we say about responding to climate change and supporting the Paris Climate Agreement, and what we do with our assets,” said Ivan Frishberg, the First Vice President of Sustainability Banking at Amalgamated Bank. “We hope that more of the global banking community will step up and address the contradiction of wanting to fight climate change but still financing some of the largest carbon sources in the world.”
The latest research from groups involved shows that the top global and US banks lend billions of dollars each year for the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel projects. Such investments, if continued, lock in infrastructure that will push the world past the international Paris Climate Agreement objectives – even as dozens of local and state officials take steps to honor the promise that President Trump broke by withdrawing from the historic deal in early June. Organizers point to the hypocrisy in these banks making statements in support of the Paris Agreement and climate action, while also maintaining investments in the dirtiest fossil fuel projects.
“Banks are still under the false impression that they can hide behind the pipeline companies as they violate Indigenous rights, poison our water and destroy our climate,” said Grand Chief Serge Simon of the Mohawk Council of Kanesatake on behalf of the over 120 Indigenous Nations who have signed the Treaty Alliance Against Tar Sands Expansion. “Banks can bet that there will be a steep price paid for being accomplices to grave crimes against Indigenous People and, in truth, all life on Earth.”
Activists believe the Standing Rock camps and recent bank protests have prompted banks to drop various DAPL investments, or have committed, as US Bank did recently, to revisit their financing of future fossil fuel projects that threaten Indigenous sovereignty, water and land. A recent federal court ruling on the inadequacy of the Army Corps’ environmental review of DAPL also provides renewed leverage against the so-called “pipeline banks”. The opening of a new protest camp in South Louisiana, L’eau Est La Vie, blocking the Bayou Bridge pipeline – a final pipeline segment linked with DAPL – demonstrates a growing and deepening resolve.
With growing support from hundreds of thousands of people representing billions of dollars, pipeline resistance leaders say they plan to deliver the message to every bank, branch by branch, closing accounts and disrupting business as usual until they stop financing Enbridge, Kinder Morgan and TransCanada, the primary companies behind tar sands pipelines projects.
“More and more people are refusing to allow their dollars to flow into Energy Transfer Partner’s pockets,” said Dallas Goldtooth, Keep It In the Ground Campaign Organizer for the Indigenous Environmental Network. “Despite massive support for Water Protectors and the attention given to Standing Rock, ETP continues to move dirty oil through our sacred lands with the full support of Donald Trump and the climate deniers running his administration. We’re calling on our partners and supporters to join us and keep our divestment movement going. ETP cannot move forward without resources to finance their pipelines. It’s time we showed our power by moving our dollars.”

Leila Salazar López, Executive Director of Amazon Watch, said: “From Standing Rock to the Amazon, indigenous communities and allies are taking their demands for indigenous land rights, sacred site preservation, and environmental protection to the halls of financial power. The tens of thousands of people supporting this effort and divesting from the banks that continue to fund destructive fossil fuel infrastructure have sent a clear message: our future lies not in fossil fuels but in the protection of rights, the environment, the climate and bold investments in renewable energy.”
Todd Larsen, Executive Co-Director of Green America said: “We all have a responsibility to lower the impacts of climate change on our planet and protect communities from the harmful impacts of pollution from fossil fuels. Many of our largest banks are failing to accept their responsibility in addressing the climate crisis. That’s why it’s so inspiring to see a range of investors – from individuals to municipalities – pulling their money out of banks that underwrite fossil fuel expansion.”
David Turnbull, Campaigns Director at Oil Change International said: “Every new fossil fuel project poses a threat to our climate, and banks financing companies like Energy Transfer Partners are accomplices to that dangerous reality. The movement to defund the fossil fuel industry continues to grow tremendously, and these efforts couldn’t come at a more important moment. While the federal government seeks to undermine the hard-fought climate action of recent years, people are rising up and saying no to dirty fossil fuels and yes to funding a safer world.”
Diana Best, Senior Climate and Energy Campaigner at Greenpeace USAsaid: “Banks must now decide whether they want to risk their businesses and reputations on the vision of the oil and gas industry. It is a vision in which dwindling water resources are squandered, the climate is intolerably hostile, and human rights and the legal rights of Indigenous communities are subordinated to the short term resuscitation of a dying industry. It is time for the banking and finance sector, which prides itself on anticipating long-term trends, to see the writing on the wall: These pipelines are incompatible with justice, human rights, and a livable world. Funding them will not only be materially risky, it will put these banks on the wrong side of the greatest issue of our time.”
Ruth Breech, Senior Climate and Energy Campaigner at Rainforest Action Network said: “Once again, we see that people power is the only real way to challenge corporate power. While banks like JPMorgan Chase continue to pump billions into the most dangerous fossil fuels, Indigenous communities are leading the way toward peaceful solutions and a sustainable tomorrow. Tar sands pipelines create climate chaos, trample on Indigenous rights, threaten clean water and lock us into another era of an outdated and dangerous energy system. The fact is banks must exit from the tar sands sector completely. And we are sending a clear message: If you don’t drop these pipelines –– we will drop you. And beware, because “we,” means 150,000 people strong and counting.”
RL Miller, cofounder of Climate Hawks Vote, said: “We’re drawing a line in the sand. On one side, those who destabilize our climate and those who profit from, fund, and invest in destruction of a habitable planet; on the other side, humanity. Banks need to choose whether they stand with Exxon Mobil or the human beings who place their money and their trust in financial institutions.”
Drew Hudson, founder of 198 methods, said: “It is clear from where they put their money that these big banks are siding with President Trump and are betting that the world will fail to meet even the modest goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. They write letters and claim to support climate action, but their when the chips are down, their actions are completely inconsistent with saving the lives of their customers by stopping the most dangerous climate change impacts.”
Doug Norlen, Director, Economic Policy Program, Friends of the Earth U.S. said: “By divesting from banks financing fossil fuels and investing in values-aligned banks, we are bending the arc towards a more sustainable and just future. We hope and expect many others will join us.”

Gdańsk, Poland  ",ENERGA AGM: shareholders ask about Ostrołęka C,,,Ostroleka C coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Poland,"
ENERGA Group is one of the key Polish companies providing energy generated from hard coal. Together with another company ENEA, it is preparing development of a new coal unit Ostrołęka C. This strategy constitutes yet another step to further increase ENERGA’s coal dependence which makes it incompatible with the EU climate policy and the Paris Climate Agreement.
In the ENERGA Group Strategy for years 2016-2025 (of 15.11.2016) climate commitments and supply diversification are listed as key tasks which must be completed in the following years.
How is ENERGA going to contribute to the proportionate part of the EU climate commitments (until 2020) to which Poland committed in 2009, and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions stemming from the Paris Agreement on climate protection of 2014, ratified by Poland in 2016? – Diana Maciąga, Association Workshop for All Being, asked during the AGM.
Shareholders aske several other questions related to ENERGA financing:
·        Under what market conditions, according to ENERGA, will the Ostrołęka C project be economically viable – does the project require any additional financial aid mechanisms aid if so – what are they and are they guaranteed?
·        While developing the Ostrołęka C project, does ENERGA take into consideration the risk of public resistance and health and environmental hazards as well as the need to comply with the new emission standards set by the IED Directive applicable from January 2016 and the binding BAT/BREF limits?
·        What consequences for the minority Shareholders of ENERGA would the two alternative scenarios have: decision to construct the Ostrołęka C power plant or abandoning this project? What would be the correspondent dividends paid by ENERGA (up until 2025)?
In spite of the global trend to phase out coal, manifested in closing coal-powered power plants and in many banks withdrawing their financial support for such projects, ENERGA keeps developing a new, 1000 MW coal-fired unit at Ostrołeka which is going to be a new source of pollution and greenhouse gas emissions – explains Diana Maciąga. 
The questions were sumitted to ENERGA’s Board prior to the AGM. It is a common practice that during AGMs the shareholders may ask questions and enter into a direct dialogue with Boards as it is done during the AGM of another Polish energy company – PGE – which also broadcasts the AGM online. Unfortunately, ENERGA did not provide for such possibility. There was no room for questions during the AGM but the company committed to answer them in writing in 14 days.
We are aware of the fact that the questions are not easy to answer and we understand that the company needs time to address them. Yet we do regret that the time for discussion was not found during the AGM. We feel that by doing this ENERGA prevents shareholders from engaging in dialogue with the Board and reduces it to exchange of letters, and the AGM – to a voting machine – concludes Diana Maciąga.

",Fossil Fuel Finance Report Card 2017 reveals bank policies fail to respond to climate risks,,,Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion project (TMEP) ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,Canada,"
A report released today by Rainforest Action Network, BankTrack, Sierra Club and Oil Change International, in partnership with 28 organisations around the world, reveals that the world’s biggest banks are continuing to fuel climate change through the financing of extreme fossil fuels. The report finds that 2016 actually saw a steep fall in bank funding for extreme fossil fuels — however despite this overall reduction, banks are still funding extreme fossil fuel projects at a rate that will push us beyond the 1.5 degrees climate change limit determined by the Paris Climate Agreement.

Download the full report with 2017 bank grades here.
See how the banks stack up and explore the data here. 


In 2014, the banks analysed in the report funneled USD 92 billion to extreme fossil fuels. In 2015, that number rose to USD 111 billion. 2016 was the first full calendar year to be studied since the signing of the Paris Climate Agreement – and the USD 87 billion figure represents a 22 percent drop from the previous year. While the drop-off is a move in the right direction, it is vital that this become an accelerating trend and not a blip. The report's findings show that if we are to have any chance of halting catastrophic climate change and reaching the Paris goal of limiting climate change to 1.5 degrees, there must be a complete phaseout of these dangerous energy sources and banks must implement policies against extreme fossil fuel funding.
“Right now, the biggest Wall Street funder of extreme fossil fuels is JPMorgan Chase. In 2016 alone they poured USD 6.9 billion into the dirtiest fossil fuels on the planet,” said Lindsey Allen, executive director of Rainforest Action Network. “On Wall Street they are number one in tar sands oil, Arctic oil, ultra-deepwater oil, coal power and LNG export. Even in this bellwether year when overall funding has declined, Chase is funneling more and more cash into extreme fossil fuels. For a company that issues statements in favor of the Paris Climate Accord, they are failing to meet their publicly stated ambitions.”
The report, Banking on Climate Change, is the eighth edition of this fossil fuel finance report card that ranks bank policies and practices related to financing in the most carbon-intensive, financially risky, and environmentally destructive sectors of the fossil fuel industry. Those sectors are: extreme oil (tar sands, Arctic, and ultra-deepwater oil), coal mining, coal power, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) export.
Yann Louvel, BankTrack's climate and energy campaign coordinator said, “There is simply not enough time left for more excuse-making, more fiddling at the policy edges and more egregious bank investments in extreme infrastructure projects like pipelines that transport tar sands oil. When we sit in meetings with bank staff, we hear of their revulsion to Trump's stance on climate change and of their support for clean investments, yet their actions of continued investments in extreme fossil fuels demonstrate that they actually side with the Trump approach. The climate and profit imperatives for banks can coincide when it comes to clean energy investing, but as they continue to prove with their shortsighted fossil fuel investments, they're at complete odds with the world's long-term climate targets.""
The report also explores bank failures when it comes to protecting human rights. The most glaring example of this in 2016 was the financing for the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) and the rampant violations of Indigenous rights associated with that project – which triggered an Indigenous-led defund and divest movement that targets banks that finance dirty energy projects.
“The movement standing up to fossil fuel projects wherever they are proposed has gotten so large that these investments are now not only problematic from a climate and human rights perspective, but they’re also risky investments from an economic perspective too,” said David Turnbull, campaigns director at Oil Change International. “Our research has shown that any new fossil fuel development runs counter to our climate goals. If banks want to truly be leaders in their field, they need to stop ignoring climate risk and ensure their investments pass the climate test.”
In this past year alone, San Francisco, Seattle, WA, and Davis, CA, pulled their money out of Wells Fargo because of the bank’s various misdeeds including the funding of DAPL. Caving into public pressure, multiple major banks have announced that they are pulling out of DAPL, which emphasizes the need for proactive bank policies that restrict financing to fossil fuels and the human rights abuses associated with their extraction and transport.
""As the Trump administration continues to make reckless decisions that threaten our climate, it is more important than ever that the public is informed about whether the financial institutions we trust with our money are making investments that will worsen this crisis,” said Lena Moffitt, senior campaign director of the Sierra Club’s Our Wild America campaign. “The people are watching where and what banks sink their funds into, and they will not back down until every last one commits to investing in a future that benefits their communities, their economies, and their health.""
Additional quotes from partner organisations in support of the report:
Shin Furuno, 350.org Japan Divestment campaign, commented: “The research shows that major Japanese banks are failing to integrate climate risk in their investment decisions. Starting with an immediate freeze on new fossil fuel financing, banks should divest from fossil fuels in line with keeping global warming well below 2 degrees. If Japanese banks continue to invest in coal and extreme fossil fuels, they risk becoming saddled with stranded assets and will face a backlash from investors and customers alike.”
Jenny Marienau, 350.org's US campaigns director, said: “There's no question that funding climate change is a deadly investment strategy. Yet banks around the world are funneling billions of dollars into the fossil fuel projects leading us closer to catastrophic warming every day. Movements like the Indigenous-led effort to Defund DAPL are rightfully pressuring banks to divest from infrastructure like the Dakota Access pipeline that puts profits before human rights and a livable future. It's up to us to resist these disastrous projects, push back on these fatal investments, and build the renewable energy solutions we need.”
Kuba Gogolewski, finance campaigner at Polish Foundation “Development YES - Open-Pit Mines NO”, said: “Funding companies that are developing new coal mines and power plants and planning more projects in the future is clearly at odds with climate science. It is just a question of time when communities impacted by climate change will start suing not only the companies developing coal projects but also the banks providing finance to build them.”
Vanessa Green, director of DivestInvest Individual, said: “This report is a well-timed reality check for the executive leadership at these banks, and for their investor and retail consumer audiences. While policies and promises can land in gray areas, these extreme fossil fuel financing numbers show that in practice banks are saying one thing about meeting Paris Agreement goals, and doing another. Fortunately, investors and consumers are paying close attention and moving their money to financial institutions with more integrity.”
Diana Best, senior climate and energy campaigner with Greenpeace US, added: “People across the planet are waking up to the role and responsibility of large banks in the proliferation of fossil fuel extraction, development, and transport. In many cases, these very same banks have policies acknowledging the urgency of climate change and their commitment to the rights of indigenous communities. It is time for these banks to put their money where their mouth is and stop financing projects and companies that contribute to climate change, undermine clean air and water, and violate the rights of Indigenous people and frontline communities. Their words are only as strong as their actions and their actions are simply not enough.”
Matt Remle (Lakota), editor of Last Real Indians and co-founder of Mazaska Talks, said: “It is our collective duty towards Ina Maka (Mother Earth) and the next generations that we hold financial institutions responsible in ensuring that they are not financing projects like DAPL, tar sands pipelines, fracked gas plants, coal and other institutions that adversely impact Indigenous, low-income and communities of color such as private prisons and immigration detention centers. It is important, and necessary, to illuminate just exactly where these institutions are investing our money.""
Julien Vincent, Market Force’s executive director, said: “The banks featured in this report have it within their power to avoid runaway climate change if they decided to. They have power of life or death over polluting fossil fuel companies. Their decisions make or break coal, oil and gas projects that threaten our chances of a safe climate future. But the banks are still accountable to us, and citizens need to engage these institutions to demand that they keep our money away from destructive new fossil fuel projects, investing instead in the clean, renewable energy future we desperately need.”
Rachel Heaton, a member of the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe and co-founder and organizer for Mazaska Talks, said: “It is up to us to make sure we are securing a future for our generations to come. We are here to put pressure on these financial institutions and hold them responsible to act in morally and socially productive ways that support Mother Earth. At a minimum there should be standards in place to support the well-being and survival of Indigenous peoples of the world, communities of color, and those negatively impacted by the decisions of these institutions – standards that are not only limited to fossil fuel investments, but also shady banking practices, the financing of private prisons, and other harmful impacting situations.”
Sonia Hierzig, research officer at ShareAction, said: “ShareAction warmly welcomes the launch of this report. It will present a useful resource for investors engaging with their holdings in the banking sector on climate change, as it will allow them to scrutinise the banks’ exposures to extreme oil, coal mining and power, and LNG export.”
Christina Beberdick, coal campaigner at the German NGO Urgewald, adds: “In countries like the Philippines and Vietnam we see that banks are financing companies that build entirely new coal-fired power plants, making these countries dependent on coal for decades to come. Banks and investors must stop financing coal expansion companies immediately. The climate targets of Paris will otherwise not be met. Next week, Urgewald and partners will launch the first ever list of major companies planning new coal power plants worldwide. This new forward-looking divestment tool helps banks and investors to get rid of coal.”
Donny Williams, from We Are Cove Point, commented: “It's important to hold banks accountable for the roles they play in taking away people's health, safety and well-being through these energy projects. A loss or change in financing can be enough to cancel a project that would negatively impact broad swaths of people and ecosystems. Through creative direct actions, public protest and educational tools, We Are Cove Point has worked to make it harder for Dominion to find the funding it needs to build its export terminal in our community. We're happy to see this report come out, which will hopefully make it easier for banks to stop funding these harmful projects and easier for impacted people to more effectively attack the finances behind them.""

",Ten Equator banks demand decisive action on Indigenous peoples following DAPL debacle ,ABN AMRO ,Netherlands,Dakota Access Pipeline ,energy distribution | oil and gas,United States,"
A letter by ten signatory banks to the Equator Principles, a risk management framework for project finance, has emerged in which the banks call for changes to the Equator Principles to ensure “lessons are learned” from the financing of the Dakota Access Pipeline project (DAPL).


The letter, which has been widely circulated but not previously published, is the first public sign of discord among the 90 Equator Principles banks, and follows intense international criticism of the seventeen banks that provided financing for the construction of DAPL. The pipeline project became a flashpoint in relations between Native Americans and the US state, although it was financed under Equator Principles standards which are intended to ensure environmental and social risks are well managed.


The ten banks, all from the Netherlands, France, Spain and Italy, propose changes to the Equator Principles to remove the assumption that projects in high-income countries such as the United States need less scrutiny because environmental and human rights are already adequately protected by local law, and to ensure banks have more powers to address breaches in the standards when they arise. The banks also call on the other 80 bank signatories to the Equator Principles to support these aims.


The letter does not name the Dakota Access Pipeline, but notes that some of the bank signatories to the letter “were publicly and harshly criticised for supporting a project where consultation with an Indigenous community did not involve their free, prior and informed consent (FPIC). They were also criticised for not being able to intervene with the Sponsors in order to help identify a solution that was agreeable to all parties in this context.”


The ten banks go on to express concern that the case “is likely to damage the reputation of the Equator Principles (EPs) as a “golden standard” and a common playing field for determining, assessing and managing environmental and social risks in projects”. Noting that they remain committed to the EPs but that “that the world has changed”, the banks recommend that “significant improvement to the EPs is now needed to avoid similar situations in the future”.


The Equator Principles Association already announced on 18th May that a “working group” would re-examine the distinction between high-income countries and others, pre-empting the letter from banks, dated 22nd May.


The letter was signed by ABN Amro, BNP Paribas, BBVA, Credit Agricole, FMO, Intesa Sanpaolo, Natixis, NIBC, Rabobank and Société Générale. Of these, five (BBVA, Credit Agricole, Intesa Sanpaolo, Natixis and Société Générale) participated in the Dakota Access Pipeline project loan. The lead banks behind the loan - Citi, Mizuho, Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ and TD Bank – have not signed the letter, although Citi has noted in its reporting that “the current approach to consulting Indigenous peoples in the U.S. does not align with international standards”.


Civil society groups sent an open letter to the Chair of the Equator Principles Association in November last year urging the Association to take long overdue, concrete steps to strengthen their climate commitments, and to express deep concern about the role of Equator banks in financing DAPL.

Johan Frijns, BankTrack director, comments: “The changes demanded by these banks would be a significant step in the right direction, but deeper changes than this are needed to ensure the Equator Principles are fit for purpose in the post-Paris Agreement world. In particular, the minimal commitments on climate change are wholly inadequate to make the Principles Paris-proof and must be strengthened. These issues can only be adequately resolved with a new update to the Equator Principles, and we hope the Equator Principles Association will set this overhaul in motion, at least by the time of its annual meeting in October.”

",UN office publishes detailed human rights guidance for banks,,,,,,"
The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on Monday published a 16-page interpretive advice note on the banking sector’s responsibilities for managing the human rights impacts of its finance. The advisory note – the OHCHR’s most detailed guidance to the banking sector to date – comes in advance of a meeting next Monday 19th June organised by the Thun Group, an informal grouping of banks on human rights, at which a recent controversial paper by the group of banks will be discussed.


The interpretive guidance is a response to a request by BankTrack for advice on how the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (“the UN Guiding Principles”) should be applied in the context of the banking sector.


BankTrack’s request to the OHCHR followed a “Discussion Paper” released by the Thun Group in January this year, which was strongly criticised for unilaterally declaring that banks would not generally be considered, under the UN Guiding Principles, to be causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts arising from their clients' operations. This apparent attempt to play down banks’ human rights responsibilities contradicted previous advice from as early as 2013, from the OHCHR and others, and led Professor Ruggie, the author of the UN Guiding Principles, to publicly state that he was “deeply troubled” by the paper.


The new interpretive advice from the OHCHR:

reaffirms that banks can contribute to adverse human rights impacts through their finance, for example if its actions and decisions influence a client in such a way as to make an impact more likely. In such circumstances, the bank may be responsible for remediating the human rights impact together with its client. A bank may also be directly linked to a human rights impact through its finance, without contributing to it, in which case it would not be responsible for remedying the impact, although it may take a role in doing so. It also makes clear that neither case involves a shifting of responsibility from the client onto the bank.


elaborates on the factors influencing the nature of a bank’s involvement with an adverse human rights impact, including whether the bank was incentivising or facilitating harm, and the quality of its human rights systems and due diligence processes. It also describes how banks can move from being directly linked to an instance of human rights abuse to contributing to it, if it “over time fails to take reasonable steps to seek to prevent or mitigate the impact”.


discusses the responsibility of banks to remediate human rights impacts when they identify they have contributed to them, and their separate responsibility to establish or participate in a grievance mechanism so that people whose rights have been affected by the bank can seek remedy. These are areas which have been relatively little discussed by the banking industry – indeed, the Thun Group of banks committed in 2014 to “explore options for addressing the third pillar (of the UN Guiding Principles), i.e. access to remedy”, but took no further action to deliver on this. BankTrack research has found no evidence that any private sector bank has yet developed a grievance mechanism which comes close to meeting the UN’s guidelines.

The advice of the OHCHR is likely to inform relevant multi-stakeholder processes, including the OECD’s project on Responsible Business Conduct in the finance sector, and the Dutch Banking Sector Agreement on human rights. It should be read carefully by anyone within the banking sector with responsibility for sustainability and human rights.

London ",WWF calls on all banks to take action to prevent funding companies or activities that threaten endangered wildlife and local communities,,,,,,"

Global banks need to tighten their policies to prevent them from financing companies whose activities could damage World Heritage sites
Two-thirds of people expect their bank not to lend to companies involved in harmful industrial activities, such as mining and oil exploration, in UNESCO World Heritage sites
WWF is launching a report detailing the urgent action needed by the banking industry which shows how banks can play their part in safeguarding our critical natural capital

A new report by WWF reveals that, despite some good practice, no major global bank has robust enough policies in place to safeguard World Heritage sites.
A WWF survey found that 66 per cent of people in the UK said that they expect their bank not to fund any activity that might cause damage to World Heritage sites.
Despite being awarded the highest levels of protection by the United Nations, almost half of all World Heritage sites listed for their natural values are threatened by harmful industrial practices such as oil and gas exploration and mining. As providers of capital, banks lend to companies whose activities have the potential to cause damage to World Heritage sites, unless they have a specific and robust enough policy in place to protect against it. These unique places are home to some of the world’s most endangered animals, such as elephants, tigers and rhinos, and help provide livelihoods to over 11 million people.
Chris Gee, Head of Campaigns, WWF-UK said:
“From the Galápagos Islands to Mount Kilimanjaro, UNESCO World Heritage sites are some of the most incredible places on earth, but decisions being made in the UK are putting them at risk. We need to be doing everything we can to prevent this. Banks are uniquely placed as they lend to companies that have the potential to cause irreversible damage to these unique sites and this could be completely avoided if they had the right policies and implementation procedures in place.
“Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Australia’s Great Barrier Reef are two examples of where sites have been safeguarded from imminent threats due to campaigning, but shockingly nearly half of natural and mixed World Heritage sites are at risk from industrial activities. Banks need to take responsibility for securing the future of our World Heritage or their reputation and long-term value may be at risk.”
WWF’s report - with research undertaken by ECOFACT - looks into the role of the finance industry in safeguarding these important sites and outlines the urgent action required by banks. The report details the steps that need to be taken by banks that do not have existing guidelines as well as those that have policies in place that are not being well implemented. This includes advice on how to develop, improve and put in place a clearly worded policy, ensure it is implemented robustly, and the best ways to communicate it.
The International Council of Mining and Metals has a commitment not to operate in World Heritage sites. CEO Tom Butler said:
“Our members voluntarily decided in 2003, not to mine or explore in World Heritage sites to protect these precious places. Yet 14 years later, these sites are still at risk from other companies and industries. The conservation of World Heritage sites is a collective responsibility we all share and ICMM would like to see, in the context of financing, more banks move to support those businesses committed to acting responsibly. This will help ensure the outstanding universal value of World Heritage sites is protected for future generations.”
Notes to editors

Images of World Heritage sites are available here.
How banks can safeguard our world heritage is available on request. The report was compiled by WWF-UK and WWF Switzerland. Research was conducted by ECOFACT.
The report is part of a WWF global campaign, Together, Saving Our Shared Heritage, which launched in April 2016 to safeguard natural World Heritage sites. Over 1 million people have taken advocacy actions to political and business leaders including the leaders of Belize, Bulgaria, Spain, Mexico and Tanzania within the first 12 months of the campaign: wwf.org.uk/saveourheritage
The poll of 2038 people was carried out by Populus for WWF-UK (May/June 2017).
About Virunga National Park: Virunga National Park is a World Heritage site in Democratic Republic of Congo that’s home to a wealth of wildlife including critically endangered mountain gorillas. WWF campaigned against the threat posed by UK-based extractive company SOCO International. The company had been pursuing oil exploration in the park, but made the decision to halt its planned activities and pull out, writing off £43.9 million in the process.
About the Great Barrier Reef: For more than a century, dumping huge amounts of dredge spoil in reef waters was the norm. But the continuing decline of Australia's icon World Heritage site sparked an international campaign to end this outdated practice. WWF and other campaigners helped persuade the Australian government to stop up to 46 million cubic metres of dredge spoil from being dumped in reef waters. That's enough dredge spoil to fill 4.6 million dump trucks.
A 2016 report published by WWF details the issues faced by natural World Heritage sites and how safeguarding these areas of outstanding universal value can drive sustainable development.
In April 2017, WWF published a report on illegal wildlife trafficking in World Heritage sites. Despite their recognized value and protected status, the report found that illegal fishing, poaching and logging occur in nearly 50 per cent of natural World Heritage sites, driving endangered species like tigers, elephants and rhinos to the brink of extinction and putting the livelihoods and wellbeing of communities who depend on them at risk.
In 2015 WWF, Aviva Investors and Investec Asset Management published a report showing that almost a third of world heritage sites listed for their natural value were under threat of oil, gas and mining exploration.

",28 major banks warned not to finance Trans Mountain pipeline expansion,Bank of America ,United States,Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion project (TMEP) ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,Canada,"
This week, over 20 Indigenous and environmental organizations, including BankTrack, delivered an open letter to 28 major banks, calling on them to back away from funding the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project (TMEP).
The warning letter urges banks to avoid the reputational and financial risk of supporting this destructive project, which is incompatible with realizing the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement and respecting human rights, especially those detailed in the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.
“Mark my words, Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project will never see the light of day,” said Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, President of the Union of the BC Indian Chiefs. “We do not accept the unscrupulous liability of dirty oil coming through any pipeline system to benefit some Texans or multinational interests at the expense of our inherent responsibilities to our grandchildren’s grandchildren.”
The Trans Mountain Expansion Project would not only triple Trans Mountain’s capacity - transporting an additional 590,000 barrels of crude oil each day - it would lock in expanded production of one of the most carbon-intensive oils, Alberta tar sands oil.
The 28 banks are the 14 banks that underwrote the Kinder Morgan Canada IPO (Bank of America, Bank of Montreal, Barclays, Canadian and Imperial Bank of Commerce, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Mizuho Financial Group, National Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Canada, Scotiabank, Société Générale, and Toronto-Dominion Bank); and 14 other banks participating in current and past Kinder Morgan revolving credit facilities (BayernLB, BBVA, BNP Paribas, BPCE/Natixis, Citigroup, Crédit Agricole, DNB ASA, ING, Morgan Stanley, Regions Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, SunTrust, UBS, and Wells Fargo).
“We’re making it loud and clear that banks need to back off from funding Trans Mountain,” says Lindsey Allen, Executive Director of Rainforest Action Network. “Any bank that decides to participate in this project will be implicated in Indigenous rights violations and will knowingly feed fuel to the fire of climate chaos. They won't be able to claim that they didn’t have all the relevant information.”
The existing Trans Mountain pipeline has sprung 82 recorded spills, including four major spills since Kinder Morgan bought the pipeline in 2005. Future spills, from a massively expanded pipeline, would endanger local sources of drinking water.
“As banks consider financing Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain Expansion tar sands pipeline, they should know that the over 120 First Nations and Tribes that have signed the Treaty Alliance Against Tar Sands Expansion will not let this project happen, says Grand Chief Serge Simon of the Mohawk Council of Kanesatake on behalf of the Treaty Alliance Against Tar Sands Expansion. “Indigenous and allied resistance to the pipeline will not be limited to BC either – it will be all over Turtle Island and will also target the banks that chose to ignore our opposition.”
As with the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), a highly controversial project constructed without the free, prior, and informed consent of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion poses a grave threat to Indigenous rights. First Nations that would be directly impacted by the route and port terminal are fighting the project in the courts and leading robust protests on the ground.
“​Until banks honor the right to Free Prior and Informed Consent of indigenous ​people - including the Dené, Cree,​ Metis, and​ Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation - we will continue to call on municipal and foreign governments to divest from these banks,” says Jacqueline Fielder of Mazaska Talks.
With financing for Kinder Morgan’s TMEP being finalized in the coming weeks, the groups are urging the banks to heed the lessons learned from DAPL and decline any additional involvement with Kinder Morgan that would facilitate financing of the TMEP, particularly Kinder Morgan’s planned C$5.5 billion credit facility.  
“Tar sands oil is deadly, destructive, and economically infeasible,” said Tara Houska, National Campaigns Director of Honor the Earth. “Banks run on our money — we have a say in how it is invested. Without consent of indigenous nations impacted by these projects, banks are supporting sacrifice zones, while also actively contributing to climate change. Invest in renewables and our future.”  
Additional statements:
Eugene Kung, Barrister & Solicitor at West Coast Environmental Law:

“The material legal, political and reputational risk facing Kinder Morgan’s pipeline and tanker project means that this is not your average pipeline investment. Investors should be aware of the significant uncertainty surrounding the project the associated risks for anyone invested in it. Kinder Morgan’s pipeline and tanker project does not have the consent of affected First Nations, who have banned it in their unextinguished Indigenous laws. This represents significant legal, political and reputational risk that investors need to understand.”
Clayton Thomas-Müller of the Mathias Colomb First Nation, and Campaigner at 350.org:

“The extraction and production of tar sands oil not only spreads climate chaos across the planet, it has been killing Dené, Cree and Métis people in Northern Alberta through cancer and the poisoning of their water and food systems. Banks that fund tar sands infrastructure like Trans Mountain are writing death warrants for our people and the world at large.”
Ben Smith, Field Organizing Manager with Greenpeace:

“The banks on this list have a choice. They can acknowledge the material and reputational risk of investing in highly controversial projects like the Trans Mountain Expansion Project (TMEP), or they can continue their wishful thinking that the world won’t notice they are contributing to the destruction of the environment, worsening climate change, and violating Indigenous rights. The moral and economic sense to move away from yesterday’s energy source has been acknowledged the world over, and the emboldened movement to stand up to big oil is building unprecedented strength. The time has come for financial companies to end their relationship with destructive companies like Kinder Morgan and stand with the people and the planet.
Tom BK Goldtooth, Executive Director, Indigenous Environmental Network:

“Our prophecies tell us that life on Mother Earth, as we know it, is in danger and coming to a great transformation. The time is now for banks to divest from an economy based on industrial extraction, production and combustion of fossil fuels and its environmentally risky transportation infrastructures. Investment policy changes are urgently needed that recognize the health and vitality of Earth’s living systems, ecological and social well-being and the rights of Indigenous Peoples.”
Lucie Pinson, private finance campaigner at Friends of the Earth France:

“European banks are not going to be spared from the mobilization in support of indigenous people against tar sands and other fossil fuels projects in North America. Banks which fail to stay clear from financing, directly or indirectly these projects will be targeted. In France, we expect Crédit Agricole, who stated during its general assembly to have rejected providing project finance to the Keystone XL, to also reject directly financing Trans Mountain and other tar sands pipelines. But only blacklisting the companies behind these pipelines will guarantee no support is given to these fatal projects.”
Sven Biggs, Climate and Energy Campaigner with Stand.earth:

“Bankers that are considering investing this project should know that the people of British Columbia do not want this pipeline. Already tens of thousands people have pledged to stand with First Nations and do whatever it takes to stop Kinder Morgan.”
Hannah McKinnon of Oil Change International:

""New tar sands infrastructure is incompatible with a safe climate, the world is in a deep hole and the first thing we need to do is stop digging. This pipeline is the epitome of risky: First Nations don't want it, the Province of British Columbia doesn't want it, the climate can't afford it, and the sector that it is being built for doesn't need it.""
Vanessa Green, Director of DivestInvest Individual:

""At this stage, the financing relationships are exposed and the financial and other risks of putting money into fossil fuel infrastructure are clear. To not recognize them, as an executive or an investor amounts to some combination of negligence, laziness, bad business and moral bankruptcy. What is less clear is which of these banks will gain the most by tapping into the massive global consumer interest in investing where our energy opportunities align with a social conscience.""
Regine Richter of Urgewald:

“Some banks participating in DAPL may have wished they hadn’t. They now have a chance to show they learned their lesson and refrain from getting involved in Trans Mountain. If they don’t and help financing it, they manifest their total ignorance towards climate, environment and human rights.”
Lena Moffitt, Senior Campaign Director, Our Wild America Campaign - Sierra Club: 

""Tar sands expansion is disastrous for land, water, climate, and communities. If big banks support this toxic and destructive industry, they are betraying the people who entrust them with their money. We stand with Indigenous communities in urging financial institutions not to finance the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion or any other dangerous tar sands project.""

",Report links Colombian airport expansion to health harm: airport operators and investors must act,,,El Dorado International Airport ,transport and infrastructure,Colombia,"
Sign the petition to tell airport operators and investors to act.
On 5 June 2017, the independent accountability office of the Inter-American Development Bank confirmed that the Bank did not do enough to protect neighboring communities from serious harm when it funded the expansion of El Dorado International Airport in Bogotá, Colombia. The noise pollution suffered by those communities is grave and relentless, from the takeoff and landing of military as well as commercial aircraft at one of Latin America’s busiest airports. Noise is a long-standing problem that has been made worse by the airport’s expansion.
The report reads like a laundry list of failures to recognize the human cost of the expanded airport.

The Bank and its client, the company OPAIN, failed to recognize the scale and complexity of the noise risks. Fontibón, a locality adjacent to the airport, has a population of more than 300,000 people and many of its residents live directly on the margins of the airport. Houses and buildings, which pre-date the expansion, press up against the airport, with only a road and, for some, a dirt barrier separating residents from the runway and aircraft. The Bank and OPAIN failed to evaluate the impact that increased noise generated by the expanded airport would have on the residents there.
The Bank and OPAIN failed to meaningfully consult communities before the project was approved and as it was implemented. They failed to ask them about insomnia, anxiety, hearing damage and stress that community members suffer daily.
The Bank and OPAIN failed to ensure that appropriate systems were in place to protect communities from the noise. They failed to ensure that there was adequate, complete and effective noise insulation in their homes: insulation that Aerocivil – the government project partner – is required by the airport’s environmental license to provide.
Noise levels in the Fontibón neighborhood have frequently exceeded national legal noise limits. The airport’s environmental license has been violated, in some cases leading to sanctions imposed on Aerocivil. Yet the Bank had no system in place to monitor or respond to Aerocivil’s violations, and therefore had no way to ensure that the project it was financing complied with national law.
These failures are linked to the health and stress impacts that communities are suffering. Studies have found that at least a third of Fontibón residents suffer from chronic insomnia and that reports of hearing damage are higher in areas with greater exposure to the noise. Children are particularly vulnerable, with studies finding a relationship between long-term exposure to aircraft noise and developmental delays.

“During its visit to the Project area, the Compliance Review Panel … was able to experience firsthand not only the impact of the noise on the daily life of residents (such as the need to interrupt a conversation or classroom activities when airplanes take off and land because it was impossible for the other person or the teacher to be heard, or the vibrations caused by some aircraft), but also the discomfort produced in some homes by the soundproofing, which in the Panel’s experience is in poor condition, does not really reduce noise, and prevents, among other things, ventilation in the homes.” (MICI Report, paragraph 2.99)
Comunidades Unidas, a community organization representing Fontibón residents, has been fighting for years for recognition of these mistakes. They feel vindicated by the report’s conclusions.
However, despite the strength of these findings, the Bank does not plan to take any meaningful steps towards fixing the problems in Bogotá. The loan taken by OPAIN was repaid early and there is no longer a contractual relationship between the Bank and the company. The Bank failed to adopt MICI’s recommendation that the Bank work with relevant Colombian authorities to analyze ways to improve the sustainability of the airport, claiming that such action is out of its hands. However, an institution with as much wealth and influence as the Inter-American Development Bank knows no such barrier. The only barrier is continued indifference to community suffering.
So, the work of Comunidades Unidas – with support from partners, including Accountability Counsel and BankTrack – continues:

We call on OPAIN and Aerocivil to return to the table, to talk with communities about potential solutions. The report clarifies numerous issues – acknowledging as fact the lack of community consultation and establishing a link between the project and the health problems – and therefore creates new space for constructive discussion with Comunidades Unidas and other community representatives.
We call on the airport’s new investors to support this conversation and to demand proper noise impact evaluation and mitigation from OPAIN and Aerocivil.
And we call on affected communities, residents of Bogotá and their supporters to sign this petition, to lend your voice to Comunidades Unidas’ demands.

Together, we will continue to push for a long-term noise management plan that protects community health and wellbeing. And we will continue to demand that community voices are an essential part of that conversation.

Oslo, Norway ",New report linking Nordic banks and government pension funds to Indonesia’s palm oil deforestation,Danske Bank ,Denmark,,,,"
While Nordic governments have taken a strong public stance against deforestation, major banks and pension funds in the region - including the Norwegian government’s own pension fund - have invested more than US $2 billion in six Southeast Asian banks that finance more than 50 percent of Indonesia’s rainforest-ravaging oil palm operations, according to a new report released today from Rainforest Foundation Norway.
Read the report ""Nordic investments in banks financing Indonesian palm oil"" here.
Read the executive summary of the report ""Nordic investments in banks financing Indonesia palm oil"" here.
“Evidence that Norwegians and Swedes are indirectly supporting an industry that has destroyed huge tracts of rainforest is hard to square with this region’s reputation as a global leader in the fight against deforestation,” said Vemund Olsen of Rainforest Foundation Norway, which produced the report together with Aidenvironment and the Fair Finance Guide. “It’s a sobering reminder of the powerful economic forces propelling Indonesia’s palm oil industry and rewarding companies that adopt a scorched earth approach to palm oil production.”
Last year, Norway attracted international praise when it banned deforestation by embracing a procurement policy that it promised would ensure government purchases did not contribute to deforestation. Norway also has supported international efforts to conserve the world’s remaining rainforests and protect human rights in forest communities.
But the report shows several of Scandinavia's largest banks and pension funds - including the Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG), Nordea and the Swedish AP-fonderna - own shares in six Southeast Asian banks that back palm oil operations linked to rainforest destruction, human rights violations and greenhouse gas emissions. GPFG by itself has contributed US $1.3 billion to the Asian banks, none of which require palm oil companies they bankroll to avoid deforestation or respect land rights. Other sources of Nordic funds are Swedbank, Handelsbanken, KLP, Storebrand, Länsförsäkringar, Skandia, Danske Bank, SEB and DNB.
A series of investigations from Rainforest Foundation Norway and other experts has linked palm oil production in Indonesia to an astonishing assortment of bad outcomes for people, wildlife and the environment. They include rapid loss of biodiversity and habitat that supports endangered species such as orangutans and tigers; huge carbon emissions from fires and loss of carbon-rich peatlands that contribute significantly to climate change; land grabs that impoverish local communities; deplorable working conditions that routinely include child and forced labor; and air pollution that causes chronic respiratory ailments and premature deaths.
Southeast Asian backers of palm oil production that are key recipients of Nordic investments include Indonesia’s four largest banks - Bank Mandiri, Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI), Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI) and Bank Central Asia (BCA) - and two from Singapore, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited (OCBC) and DBS Bank. The report reveals that the four Indonesian banks account for half of all lending supporting palm oil production in Indonesia, with some US $12.5 billion in outstanding loans. The Singapore banks do not publish details of their palm oil investments, but other sources, including financial records from 16 publicly-traded Indonesian palm oil companies, revealed OCBC and DBS were among the industry’s largest lenders.
The report acknowledges that several Indonesian palm oil producers have committed to avoiding deforestation and respecting the land rights of indigenous people. But it notes that the costs of compliance have provided an opening for more unscrupulous companies to gain a competitive advantage, because the banks that fuel their operations have no requirements about avoiding environmental damage or respecting human rights.
“These banks are a major part of the palm oil problem because they are funding destructive and unethical palm oil ventures while their narrow financial interests, which favor rapacious producers over more responsible companies, undermine efforts to make the industry more sustainable,” said Vemund Olsen. 
In recent years, Scandinavian banks and funds have endeavored to sever direct ties to palm oil companies that are complicit in forest destruction and land grabs from indigenous communities. But the report notes they have not taken the next step to monitor what other institutions are doing with their investments.
“It’s time for Scandinavian banks and pension funds to follow the money and pledge to withdraw investments in banks that support destructive palm oil ventures,” said Jakob König of Fair Finance Guide Sweden. “We cannot be a credible leader in the fight to preserve the world’s rapidly dwindling rainforests when so much Nordic money is so closely tied to rainforest destruction.”
The report calls on Nordic asset managers to demand that Southeast Asian banks “adopt and enforce No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation (NDPE) financing policies as a prerequisite for continued investment.” It also urges Nordic asset managers to increase their influence over the Asian banks by developing partnerships with colleagues around the world, such as the leaders of the giant Vanguard and Blackrock funds, and encouraging them to embrace NDPE policies.

Nijmegen ","Banks provide billions for Dirty Diesel traders while failing to act on human rights, says new briefing",ANZ ,Australia,Trafigura ,commodities trading | oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,Singapore,"
A new BankTrack briefing raises serious questions about how banks are conducting human rights due diligence and their ability to recognise and act upon the impacts of their finance. For the publication, “Banks and Dirty Diesel” , BankTrack contacted 26 banks that have loaned billions to the oil traders Trafigura and Vitol, to request details of how they have fulfilled their human rights obligations in light of a detailed investigation by Swiss NGO Public Eye into how the traders are flooding Africa with toxic fuels. Banks from the UK, France, Netherlands and Japan are among their largest financiers of the companies.
The investigation tested petrol and diesel at the pump in eight West and Central African countries to show how these traders take advantage of weak fuel standards by supplying and retailing cheap fuels, with sulphur levels typically hundreds of times the European limit, at the expense of people’s health.
Each of the 26 banks contacted have loaned over $1 billion to Trafigura and Vitol in total since 2012. Almost all banks responded, but according to BankTrack’s analysis, most did not address the impacts of their clients directly. Nine banks did provide a view on the traders’ export of high-sulphur fuels, and seven said they had discussed the issue with the companies. However, none said that they had challenged the companies to stop the practice, described as “unethical and unacceptable” by the UN Environment Programme, nor planned to do so.
Several banks repeated claims made by Trafigura and Vitol that only government regulation can address the problem of high sulphur content fuels, and that “unilateral” action by companies would not solve the problem. However, these claims have already been refuted by Public Eye, which has found no valid reason that companies producing and shipping fuels to Africa cannot deliver higher quality fuels than the national specification.
Banks have a responsibility under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights to respect human rights, including the right to health. This means they should seek to at least prevent or mitigate negative impacts, by conducting human rights due diligence covering the impacts of their finance. In this case, banks could have fulfilled this responsibility by engaging with their customers to seek changes to their business practices following the widely-reported Public Eye investigation.
Ryan Brightwell, BankTrack Human Rights Campaign Coordinator, said: “Rather than critically investigating the impacts of Trafigura and Vitol’s behaviour, banks seem to have simply accepted their clients’ excuses for inaction at face value. Banks need to ensure their human rights due diligence is more than skin deep, and demand that these companies stop selling Dirty Diesel if they are to continue receiving billions in finance.”
Andreas Missbach of Public Eye, an author of the September 2016 report and a BankTrack board member, said: “It is absolutely unacceptable that the banks financing Trafigura and Vitol simply accept factually wrong excuses from these trading behemoths, that defend a toxic business model which puts extra profit above the health of the urban population in Africa and elsewhere.”

",Funding of banned cluster bombs still rising,,,,,,"
Investment in companies producing cluster bombs went up last year. This is in spite of the fact that many investors have decided to stop investing in the manufacture of these internationally banned weapons. These are the main conclusions in “Worldwide Investments in Cluster Munitions; a shared responsibility”, a report released today by PAX.
In the past 4 years, 166 financial institutions from 14 countries invested US$ 31 billion in 6 cluster bomb producers. On the other hand, this year the number of institutions with policies excluding investments in cluster bomb producers grew to 88.
More Funding

Cluster bombs have been banned under international law since 2008. Like landmines, which were banned in 1997, cluster bombs maim and kill indiscriminately. Despite the fact that a growing number of states have joined the cluster bomb ban, total investments have increased from US$ 28 billion in the 2016 report to US$ 31 billion in the 2017 report. Although many banks and other financial institutions now also ban these investments, the number investing worldwide has also increased from 158 to 166 this year.
Unacceptable partners

“Cluster bombs are banned and would not be produced without funding. We have all seen the misery they cause in Syria and Yemen. How can blue chip banks continue to invest in producers of such horrendous and banned weapons - do they simply not care? Companies which produce illegal weapons are unacceptable business partners; from the US to China, banks need to take responsibility with more ethical investments.” said Maaike Beenes, PAX programme officer.
The PAX report examines investments in a shortlist of 6 companies involved in the production of cluster munitions: China Aerospace Science and Industry (China), Hanwha (South Korea), Norinco (China), Orbital ATK (US), Poongsan (South Korea) and Textron (US).

Paris, France ",Pipeline action at Société Générale: French banks must not be Trump accomplices,BNP Paribas ,France,Dakota Access Pipeline ,energy distribution | oil and gas,United States,"
This morning Native American defenders and Friends of the Earth and ANV-COP21 activists built a pipeline inside a branch of Société Générale on Boulevard Malesherbes in Paris. The action took place to denounce support from French banks for the construction of new transportation infrastructures for unconventional fossil fuels in the United States. 


The campaigners will attend the annual general meetings of BNP Paribas and Société Générale tomorrow, and of Crédit Agricole on Wednesday, where they will call on the banks not to be complicit in the Trump administration's anti-climate policy and to abandon these projects, while respecting the rights of indigenous peoples. 


Action banners prominent at the Société Générale branch read: read “French banks, don’t Trump the climate”, and “Human Rights before profits”. Photos of this morning's action are available here.

Lucie Pinson, of Friends of the Earth France, commented: 


""We call on French banks not to be complicit in the dismantling of environmental regulations by the Trump administration. While the US government may announce at the G7 the country’s exit from the Paris Agreement, the French banks must pledge not to finance the pipeline and terminal projects which have been relaunched or supported by the Trump administration. This is not just about climate and the environment, it's about humanity. ""


Among the Native Americans who took part in today’s action are four water protectors who mobilised at Standing Rock against the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), financed in part by BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole and Société Générale.

Rachel Heaton, a water defender from the Muckleshoot tribe in the Auburn area, said: 


“We’ve come to France to show that men and women are paying high prices for the fossil fuel projects which the French banks are supporting. The violence that has been committed against the water protectors mobilised against the Dakota Access Pipeline has been particularly severe, and the rights of indigenous peoples are constantly ignored and violated by fossil fuel companies.”

Pauline Boyer, spokesperson of ANV-COP21, said:


“While the controversy surrounding DAPL is still burning , French banks are already preparing new human and environmental abuses in the United States . Today, we are at Société Générale because it is playing a key role in an export project for shale gas in southern Texas. We have already mobilised in March against BNP Paribas, also involved in a similar project, and our solidarity will not weaken until the banks have withdrawn from these projects.” 

Juan Mancias, head of the Esto'k Gna tribe from Texas, concluded: 


“When I discovered that BNP Paribas and Société Générale were involved in these terminal projects, I decided to come and meet them here in France, an internationally renowned bastion of human rights. Now they can no longer ignore the oppression of my people and my brothers and sisters. I shall be at their AGMs tomorrow to ask them to step out of these projects and to pledge never to ignore our rights.” 
 
Notes for editors:







1. In Paris on Tuesday 23 May, BNP Paribas will hold its AGM at 10am, with the Société Générale AGM taking place at 4pm. Crédit Agricole will hold its AGM at 10am in Tours on Wednesday 24 May.


						2. BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole, Societe Generale and Natixis all contributed $120 million in project financing to DAPL, and all except Société Générale are financing some or all of the companies involved in the project. Furthermore, in March 2017, BNP Paribas and Natixis refinanced Energy Transfer, DAPL’s main project sponsor.

						 

						3. Société Générale, which has participated in many liquefied natural gas (LNG) transactions in North America, is the financial co-advisor in the Rio Grande LNG project, which includes the construction of the Rio Bravo export terminal and the Rio Bravo LNG pipeline. 


						BNP Paribas is a financial advisor in the Texas LNG liquefied natural gas export terminal project. Both projects export purchased gas from Aqua Dulce, a shale gas site in the Eagle Ford Shale Basin. 


						Crédit Agricole will very likely participate in the financing of one or more of the four oil sands pipelines planned in North America: Keystone XL, Energy East, Line 3 and TransMountain. Crédit Agricole is financing all the companies behind these projects. Transcanada, refinanced by Crédit Agricole in December 2016, should not need to raise additional capital for Keystone XL. The company Kinder Morgan wants to go public on the stock market to finance TransMountain via corporate financing.

						 

						4. Two questions will be asked at each bank AGM, one asking them to commit themselves to respecting the rights of indigenous peoples in all the projects they finance and to no longer finance the companies involved in DAPL, and one asking them to pledge not to fund oil sands pipeline and LNG terminal projects planned in North America, beginning with their withdrawal from those in which they are currently involved.

",The Money Behind the Mountain Valley Pipeline: Is Your Bank Financing Another Fracked-Gas Disaster?,Bank of America ,United States,Mountain Valley Pipeline ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,United States,"
This analysis examines the banks that are in line to finance the Mountain Valley Pipeline, a 301-mile, $3.5 billion fracked-gas project proposed to run from West Virginia through south central Virginia.
EQT Midstream Partners (EQM) is the driving force behind the project and EQM’s financing reveals the clearest links to the banks that will fund the pipeline.
Eighteen banks are invested in EQM’s two key current financing sources. Six U.S. ‘main street’ banks – banks that are leading providers of personal banking services in the U.S. – rise to the top.
Bank of America leads the pack in providing over $141 million in financial backing. Wells Fargo, the lead arranger of EQM’s credit facility, PNC, SunTrust, Bank of the West (through parent company BNP Paribas), and U.S. Bank are each bankrolling EQM in the range of $76 to $86 million.
Across North America, people are increasingly targeting banks for their funding of new fossil fuel infrastructure. This briefing provides a blueprint to help people fighting the Mountain Valley Pipeline challenge the project’s financing in addition to its permits.

Frankfurt ",Campaigners to call for Deutsche Bank exit from Dominican coal plant at annual meeting ,Deutsche Bank ,Germany,Punta Catalina-Hatillo coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Dominican Republic,"
At Deutsche Bank’s annual general meeting on May 18, representatives of German, Dominican and international civil society will urge the bank to stop its financing for the Punta Catalina coal power plant, amid allegations of corruption surrounding the project.

 

In the Caribbean state of Dominican Republic, Deutsche Bank is heading a financial consortium featuring four other top European banks which have already disbursed more than half of an agreed $632.5 million loan, signed in 2015, for two new coal-fired power plants in the city of Punta Catalina. 

 

The Brazilian company Odebrecht, which received the construction contracts, is accused of bribery in the bidding process for the $2 billion project. At the annual general meeting, representatives of the National Committee to Combat Climate Change (CNLCC, Dominican Republic), urgewald (Germany) and BankTrack (international) will urge Deutsche Bank to leave the project.

 

On 21 December 2016, Odebrecht admitted in a New York court that it made bribery payments of $92 million to Dominican officials and intermediaries to secure contracts for a range of infrastructure projects between 2001 and 2014. Allegations that the Punta Catalina project is affected by the confirmed Odebrecht bribery are currently under investigation. The cases in the Dominican Republic are part of a bigger bribery scandal involving Odebrecht in 12 Latin American countries.

 

Deutsche Bank has committed to take action against corruption, both as a signatory to the Global Compact, a pact for responsible corporate governance initiated by the UN, and in its own compliance program.

 

Regine Richter, from the environmental organisation urgewald, said: ""If Deutsche Bank is serious about its fight against corruption, it must stop all financing for Punta Catalina. Otherwise, a new reputational and environmental disaster is looming.""

 

Enrique de León, from the climate protection organisation CNLCC, will describe the potentially devastating environmental and social impacts of the coal power plants at Deutsche Bank’s AGM.

 

Enrique de León said: ""My country is blessed with an abundance of renewable energy sources. Instead of making a positive impact here, Deutsche Bank wants to make my country a fossil hostage for decades by funding these new coal-fired power plants. With the corruption clouds still hanging over the project, we believe that Deutsche Bank now has the perfect opportunity to make a clean break from the deeply dirty Punta Catalina project.""

 

It is estimated that the Punta Catalina power plants will emit more than 6 million tonnes of CO2 per year, thus increasing the Dominican Republic’s CO2 emissions by 20 percent.

 

As per its new coal policy introduced in January this year , Deutsche Bank has committed to stop direct financing for all new coal-fired power plants. This restriction does not however apply to Punta Catalina, which Deutsche Bank agreed to finance in 2015. While Deutsche Bank’s new policy on coal has introduced new restrictions it does not end the bank’s financing – via corporate loans – of companies which build coal power plants.

 

Greig Aitken, coal campaigner at BankTrack, said: ""In order to support the Paris climate goals and stop lagging behind other banks in climate protection, Deutsche Bank has got to get a lot more ambitious. In the case of Punta Catalina, though, it’s not about ambition. It’s about abiding by the law and not condoning corruption, and Deutsche Bank should quickly move to end its involvement in this embarrassing investment.”

Amsterdam ",NGOs file complaint against ING for violation of OECD guidelines,ING ,Netherlands,Cirebon 2 coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Indonesia,"
Oxfam Novib, Greenpeace, BankTrack and Friends of the Earth Netherlands have this week filed a complaint against ING, the largest bank in the Netherlands, at the Dutch National Contact Point for the OECD Guidelines (NCP). The organisations claim that ING violates the OECD guidelines on the environment and climate change. The bank continues to lend billions to fossil fuel companies, with no plans to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions resulting from its finance. The four organisations called on ING Executive Chairman Ralph Hamers to make a concrete commitment at ING's annual shareholders meeting on Monday to reduce the climate impact of ING's finance.

Peter Ras, Senior Policy Advisor at Oxfam Novib, commented: ""ING invests eight times more in fossil fuel companies than in sustainable energy companies. The bank does not indicate how it wants to improve this situation in support of the UN's climate target. It now has the opportunity to announce new and ambitious climate plans, to make our complaint against the bank for breaching the OECD guidelines unnecessary.""

Kim Schoppink, Campaign Leader for Greenpeace Netherlands, commented: ""ING has been talking up its climate efforts for years. But meanwhile it keeps on lending money to companies building new coal-fired power stations. To stop climate change, the coal-fired power stations need to close.""

Johan Frijns, director of BankTrack, said: “ING’s coal policy was certainly a step in the right direction right before the Paris climate summit, clearly raising the bar for other banks to take meaningful steps forward and tackle climate change. Unfortunately, since then, we’ve seen too many of the policy’s pro-coal and anti-climate limitations reflected in persistent ING coal financing. The Paris Agreement is now in force, and much more determination to stamp out all the various financial avenues which the coal industry relies on is now needed from ING if it really wants to help ensure the achievement of the Paris goals.”


The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises clarify the expectations of governments of OECD countries, including the Netherlands, of international companies regarding corporate social responsibility. Among other things, the OECD considers it important that companies report on how much greenhouse gas emissions their activities cause and that companies set targets to reduce their emissions. ING does this for the emissions of its own operations, but not for those of the companies and projects it finances, even though these emissions are huge.


The four organisations sent their complaint to the NCP this Monday on the day of the bank’s shareholders meeting, to put ING's climate policy under the spotlight and to encourage the bank to align its policy with the OECD guidelines. The organisations call on ING to commit, by 1 September 2017 at the latest, to comply with the OECD Guidelines on the climate impact of its investments. ING can do this by publishing details of the greenhouse gas emissions of its investments, as well as ambitious, concrete and measurable targets to reduce them. This approach should align ING's climate policy with the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C, as agreed by the Paris International Climate Change Agreement in 2015.

Turtle Island ",Indigenous leaders launch new campaign to defund all four proposed tar sands pipelines,Bank of America ,United States,Dakota Access Pipeline ,energy distribution | oil and gas,United States,"
Today, a coalition of grassroots Indigenous groups from across Turtle Island joins the 121 First Nations and Tribes united by the Treaty Alliance Against Tar Sands Expansion, to launch a new, integrated divestment campaign against the banks funding Dakota Access and the four tar sands crude oil pipelines currently proposed out of Canada.   
“We call on all banks and financial institutions to withdraw their investments in the corporations proposing to build new pipelines to carry even more tar sands oil out of Canada,” says Grand Chief Derek Nepinak of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs on behalf of the Treaty Alliance Against Tar Sands Expansion.  “We call on individuals, businesses, organizations, and governments to withdraw their money from these financial institutions until they divest from these pipeline companies who are violating our rights, our treaties and our sovereignty.  We stand in solidarity with the Tribes of the Great Sioux Nation and all communities impacted by the Dakota Access Pipeline, and also call for divestment from any financial institution invested in Energy Transfer Partners.”  
“Much of my community is under water right now due to historic flooding - these are the climate fuelled disasters that banks are funding by pumping money into these pipeline projects” says Grand Chief Serge Simon of the Mohawk Council of Kanesatake, on behalf of the Treaty Alliance Against Tar Sands Expansion. “We cannot allow Big Oil to divide us or weaken our resistance: every one of these four tar sands pipelines needs to be stopped in order to stop the expansion of the Alberta Tar Sands. We stand united in the protection of our water, our communities, our climate, and our ways of life as First Peoples.”
The Mazaska Talks website (“mazaska” is Lakota for “money”) is a centralized resource for this campaign, with detailed financial data as well as tools for taking action.  The campaign targets all 61 banks that currently provide financing to Energy Transfer Partners or the three companies proposing new tar sands pipelines: TransCanada (Keystone XL and Energy East), Kinder Morgan (TransMountain Expansion), and Enbridge (Line 3 Expansion).   Enbridge was also the company behind the proposed Northern Gateway tar sands pipeline, which was defeated by First Nations and popular resistance in 2016.  A list of primary targets includes the 17 banks that fund all of these companies, as well as the convenors of major multi-bank credit facilities: Bank of America, Bank of Montreal, Barclays, BNP Paribas, CIBC, Citi, Crédit Agricole, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase, Mizuho, MUFG, RBC, SMBC, ScotiaBank, TD Bank, and Wells Fargo.  
""Divestment is the next stage in the fight against the black snake that has come to poison our lands,"" says Matt Remle of Last Real Indians, a leader of the coalition that successfully pushed the City of Seattle to divest over $3 billion from DAPL banks earlier this year.  ""Big oil and their financial backers are not persuaded by moral and environmental arguments, so it is time to hit them in the pocket book.  The resistance at Standing Rock changed the world - Indigenous Nations are rising up to create a future with clean water and respect for human rights.""  
So far, the divestment movement launched during the resistance at Standing Rock has successfully withdrawn over $5 billion from DAPL-funding banks, including money from 3 major US cities and over $80 million in individual accounts.  Three European banks have sold their shares of loans to the pipeline company in response to public pressure - DNB of Norway, ING of the Netherlands, and BNP Paribas of France.   
“These companies may not listen to morality, but they do listen to money,” says Tara Houska, National Campaigns Director of Honor the Earth and part of an Indigenous women’s delegation that traveled to Norway and Switzerland to meet directly with several banks and Norway’s oil fund. “Many of these banks already have human rights directives in place and all should have policies respecting Indigenous communities. Financiers should follow their own rules. Passing the blame onto companies committing atrocities and a federal government willing to overrun its citizens’ rights for profit is unacceptable - we are consumers, we have agency and we have a say in how our money is invested.”
This new campaign to defund the tar sands pipelines comes at a time of unprecedented economic vulnerability in the tar sands industry, due to consistently low oil prices and the extremely high cost of tar sands extraction.  Major oil companies have been withdrawing investments from the tar sands steadily over the past two years.

Amsterdam ",Dutch bank ING: Campaigners to call for coal finance cuts at AGM,ING ,Netherlands,,,,"
At its 2017 Annual General Meeting today, the biggest Dutch bank ING will face calls from European campaigners to end its financial support to companies building or planning new coal mines and coal-fired power plants.
In the spotlight at the AGM in Amsterdam  will be ING’s financial support, via loans and bond issues, to companies planning huge new coal infrastructure projects in Poland and Turkey, two key European coal hotspots in which the struggling industry is desperately putting up a last stand.
ING’s multi million euro project finance for the Cirebon 2 (Indonesia) and Punta Catalina (Dominican Republic) coal power plants, both currently mired in controversy over illegal environmental permitting and corrupt contract tendering, will also be raised with ING’s board. 
Kuba Gogolewski, a finance campaigner at Polish NGO “Development YES – Open-pit Mines NO” attending the ING AGM, said: 

“It's not a question of if but rather when young people from Poland or Turkey will start taking ING and other banks financing new coal power plants and mines to court. The climate science is conclusive and the atmosphere does not distinguish between greenhouse gas emissions from a new or old ING client.
“Either ING decides to stop doing business with companies such as PGE and ENEA which are building and planning coal expansion in Poland, or the bank will be ordered to do so just as the Dutch government has been.”
In spite of a coal finance policy which introduced, as of November 2015, certain restrictions on ING’s direct investments in coal mining and power globally, the bank is still able to lend to those coal clients it had on its books before the current policy emerged, as it has done for example with Russia’s top coal producer SUEK.
Campaigners will call on ING to end such direct coal financing, and to no longer issue bonds or general corporate finance to companies planning new coal mine or power projects.
Johan Frijns, director of BankTrack, said: 

“ING’s coal policy was certainly a step in the right direction right before the Paris climate summit, clearly raising the bar for other banks to take meaningful steps forward and tackle climate change. Unfortunately, since then, we’ve seen too many of the policy’s pro-coal and anti-climate limitations reflected in persistent ING coal financing.
“The Paris Agreement is now in force, and much more determination to stamp out all the various financial avenues which the coal industry relies on is now needed from ING if it really wants to help ensure the achievement of the Paris goals.”
Wendel Trio, director of Climate Action Network Europe, said:

""ING came out as one of the first major European banks to change its finance policy so as to be part of the solution. Yet the bank continues to give substantial financial support to Turkish and Polish coal companies that both mine and burn more coal, to the detriment of our planet.

Nijmegen ",BankTrack releases 2016 Annual Report,,,,,,"
BankTrack today released its Annual Report for 2016, giving an overview of our tracking, campaigning and NGO support activities over the last year, in pursuit of a sustainable and just banking sector.
Significant BankTrack work in 2016 covered in the report includes:

We launched the Equator Principles Track and Chase project, in a year that saw two projects financed under the Equator Principles, the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) in the United States and the Agua Zarca dam in Honduras, linked to the violent repression of human rights and environmental defenders.
We helped coordinate a major push by over 500 organisations and 700,000 individuals to tell the 17 banks behind DAPL to halt further disbursements on the loan until issues are resolved to the full satisfaction of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.
We launched our new website, after a major overhaul aimed at providing a sleeker and easier-to-use platform for our database of bank and Dodgy Deal profiles, reports and news.
We held our first campaigners’ gathering, creating a platform for campaigners from around the world to share their bank campaigning plans and strategies.
We published “Still Coughing up for Coal” to coincide with the climate conference in Marrakesh, analysing the coal policies of 22 major commercial banks, showing that these banks’ failing efforts are undermining the aims of the Paris Agreement.
We benchmarked 45 banks on human rights policies, processes and reporting, in the second “Banking with Principles?” report, and looked in depth at bank responses to human rights abuses in two briefings.
We made a major international appeal to Ex-Im Bank of India, signed by 140 NGOs in 34 countries, not to finance the Rampal coal power plant in Bangladesh.

Johan Frijns, BankTrack Director, commented: “Building on our efforts in previous years, we achieved many concrete results this year, with the number of European and US banks prepared to finance coal in particular continuing to dwindle. But our campaigning to stop banks financing disastrous deals does not always, of course, yield the desired results. We must reflect on how civil society can win the fight against the financing of iconic projects, like the Dakota Access Pipeline for example, more of the time, and what role BankTrack can play in the global coalition building against such projects. This is our key challenge for 2017.""

",Westpac’s new climate policy rules out most new coal mines – including Carmichael!,Westpac ,Australia,Carmichael coal mine project ,mining - coal  | transport and infrastructure,Australia,"
After years of pressure from customers, shareholders, environmental groups and the broader community, Westpac has just become the 19th bank around the world to either distance themselves from Galilee Basin coal export projects, or bring in a policy that prohibits lending to new coal mines like Adani’s.
Westpac’s climate change policy update, released today, says “for new thermal coal proposals we will limit lending to any new thermal coal mines or projects (including those of existing customers) to only existing coal producing basins and where the calorific value for that mine ranks in at least the top 15% globally”.
This rules Adani’s plans out on two counts, as the Galilee Basin does not currently produce coal, and the coal quality is lower than Westpac’s new threshold.
The bank also promises to: reduce the emissions intensity of its power generation portfolio; only lend to new coal power stations that reduce the overall emissions intensity of the energy grid they will operate in; and not lend to existing coal power stations for expansion or lifetime extension purposes, unless there is a reduction in emissions intensity.
On the renewable energy and energy efficiency side of things, Westpac has committed to increase lending to climate change solutions to $10 billion by 2020 and $25 billion by 2030.
While Westpac’s climate policy update is a big win for the campaign to stop Adani, it leaves a long way to go to get the bank off fossil fuels altogether.
Market Forces Executive Director Julien Vincent said of the move: “With this policy change, Westpac has raised the bar on climate change for the other big banks, becoming the first major bank to put restrictions in for new thermal coal mines. The fact that an existing lender to Adani has now ruled out financing the proposed Carmichael mine makes this announcement even more significant.""

",Banks and pension funds fail to act on allegations against Lundin Petroleum,Danske Bank ,Denmark,,,,"
Swedish banks and pension funds have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the Swedish oil company Lundin Petroleum despite allegations that the company has contributed to severe violations against human rights in Sudan. A new report from Fair Finance Guide and Swedwatch shows that the investors have failed to comply with international standards.
According to extensive documentation, Lundin Petroleum contributed to the killing and displacement of thousands of people in Sudan between 1997 and 2003. A new report, Fuel for conflict, investigates how the seven largest Swedish banks and public pension funds invest in the company and how they have acted on these allegations. The report shows that only two of them, Swedbank and the second government pension fund, AP2, have demanded an independent investigation of the company’s activities in Sudan. None of the investors have demanded that the company should compensate the victims.

""The banks and pension funds have done far too little to make sure that Lundin Petroleum acts responsibly in accordance with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and offer the victims their right to remedy and compensation"", says Jakob König, project manager at Fair Finance Guide in Sweden.

Lundin Petroleum was searching for oil in southern Sudan (today South Sudan) between 1997 and 2003, at the same time as a civil war was ravaging the country. According to UN Special Rapporteurs and organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, the conflict was scaled up by the presence of Lundin as the struggle for control of the oil fields severely affected civilians. According to an investigation by the organisation Ecos, Lundin’s activities contributed to more than 12,000 being killed and to 160,000 being displaced. Lundin has never acknowledged that the company contributed to adverse impacts on human rights but has claimed it was a force for peace.

""Despite considerable reports on how the company’s activities contributed to adverse impacts on human rights around the oil fields, banks and pension funds continued to invest in Lundin. The fact that the violations took place more than 10 years ago does not matter, the victims are still suffering the consequences. Lundin’s owners must act to make the company take on responsibility"", says Swedwatch report author and researcher Olof Björnsson.

The report shows that the banks and pension funds own shares worth more than 410 million dollars in Lundin Petroleum. Swedish bank customers and pension savers can influence the situation by encouraging banks and pension funds to take more responsibility, for example by supporting the proposition at the AGM.

Tokyo ",Major international banks and investors finance devastating impacts of forest-risk commodities, Development Bank ,China,Asia Pulp and Paper (APP) ,forestry - pulp and paper,Indonesia,"
A new report released today by Rainforest Action Network (RAN), titled “Every Investor Has a Responsibility, A Forests and Finance Dossier”, exposes a catalogue of deforestation and human rights violations that some of the world’s biggest banks and investors are financing through the operations of 8 major palm oil, pulp and paper, rubber and timber companies in Southeast Asia. The report was released at the Responsible Investor Asia conference at the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Japan.
The 8 companies profiled - Felda Global Ventures, Indofood Sukses Makmur, IOI, Wilmar, Asia Pulp and Paper, Oji Holdings, Marubeni, and Itochu - were found to have been involved in a range of social and environmental scandals in their own operations or supply chains. These included instances of using child and forced labor, taking land from Indigenous communities, clearing tropical forests, destroying carbon-rich peatlands, benefiting from corruption and selling illegally produced commodities.
“The investors and banks paying for the destruction of rainforests and abuse of local communities have a moral and financial duty to wake up to this issue. They must understand the mounting costs to the environment, society, and ultimately to their own investment,” said Tom Picken, Forests & Finance Campaign Director of Rainforest Action Network (RAN). 
RAN’s new report found that the forest sector operations of the 8 companies profiled have been facilitated by at least a combined 6.5 billion USD in bond and shareholding investment at the most recent filing date, and have received more than 28 billion USD in loans and underwriting facilities since 2010. The major banks backing these 8 companies include Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Mizuho Financial, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial, China Development Bank, RHB Banking, CIMB Group and HSBC. Some of the largest investors in the companies were found to include Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund, Vanguard, Employees Provident Fund, BlackRock, and Dimensional Fund Advisors.
Social and environmental scandals persist in companies’ supply chains, despite all 8 companies having some form of commitment or policy in place intended to address social and environmental issues in their operations. Some companies have membership in sector certification schemes like the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO).
“Investors and bankers must stop turning a blind eye to this, and acknowledge the real source of their dividends and multi-million dollar bonuses,” said Picken. “Until the financial sector commits to cut off the credit line to dodgy companies, various national and international efforts to enforce forest laws, curb climate change and stop corporate abuse will continue to be undermined.”
RAN’s report calls on investment funds and banks to develop forest-risk sector financing policies for all companies linked to tropical forest-risk commodity production and associated downstream supply chains. Such policies must identify and monitor the specific risks associated with deforestation and rights violations. Investors and banks must conduct enhanced due diligence screening, ensure independent monitoring of company operations and commit to exiting their relationships with companies that fail to conduct business responsibly.
Deforestation and related social and market impacts are becoming a growing issue of financial materiality for investors. From 2000 to 2012, an area of tropical forest nearly three times the size of Japan was lost around the world, with some of the highest losses occurring in Southeast Asia. This pressure on forests comes in large part from the growing global corporate demand for palm oil, pulp and paper, timber, rubber and other soft-commodities. Almost half of all tropical deforestation is due to illegal conversion for commercial agriculture, with half of that being the direct result of illegal conversion for export markets.
RAN’s report highlights how the financial sector, through its provision of billions of dollars annually in loans, underwriting and investments in tropical forest-risk commodity sectors, is a highly influential actor in the forest commodities sector.
 Loans and underwriting were calculated at the group company level and adjusted to more accurately capture the proportion of financing that can be reasonably attributed to the forest-risk sector operations of the selected company. The amount representing bond- and shareholdings does not include those held by some pension funds due to limitations of available data. For more information, see forestsandfinance.org.

Nijmegen, the Netherlands ",Ex-Im Bank of India confirms $1.6bn loan for Rampal coal plant to bankroll Sundarbans destruction,Export-Import Bank of  (Exim Bank) ,India,Rampal coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Bangladesh,"
Ex-Im Bank of India’s confirmation today that it is providing a $1.6 billion loan to Bangladesh-India Friendship Power Company (BIFPCL) for development of the Rampal coal plant in Bangladesh has been strongly criticised by BankTrack. 

Johan Frijns, director of BankTrack, said: 


“Ex-Im India’s decision to bankroll the massive Rampal coal plant in Bangladesh, situated right next to the Sundarbans mangrove forest, comes packaged with the claims that ‘state of the art technologies have been selected for this project’, and that ‘all environment concerns related to the project have been addressed’. Yet such statements are completely at odds with the deep concerns held by the Bangladeshi population and the international public, and fly in the face of overwhelming expert opinion to the contrary. Resistance is now set to grow further against the project promoters and the bank.


“Sundarbans is a vitally important natural wonder and economic resource for hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshis and the home to endangered species including the Royal Bengal Tiger and Irrawaddy dolphin. As is widely recognised, by international bodies such as UNESCO, Rampal stands to irreversibly blight the world’s largest mangrove forest with a range of major detrimental impacts.”


The Facility Agreement for Rampal financing between Ex-Im India and BIFPCL took place on April 10, one of a raft of deals signed between Bangladesh and India during a state visit to India made by Bangladesh’s prime minister Sheikh Hasina.


In October last year, a UNESCO monitoring mission report recommended that the 1,320 megawatt Rampal project should be ‘cancelled’ to avoid negative impacts to the Sundarbans, a designated UNESCO World Heritage site. This recommendation to the Bangladeshi government was based on a catalogue of egregious shortcomings and risks which, as the UNESCO report described in extensive detail, stem from BIFPCL’s inadequate assessment of the coal plant’s environmental impacts on the Sundarbans. 

Greig Aitken, Coal campaigner for BankTrack, said:


“If drastic improvements to the Rampal project have been made since UNESCO issued its unambiguous cancellation recommendation, it’s now incumbent on the project promoters and Ex-Im India to provide the public with the proof. Just in January, we saw the sinking of another barge containing 1,000 tonnes of coal in Sundarbans waterways, and the Rampal project would require 10,000 tonnes of coal shipped in daily through the same vulnerable rivers. Major question marks hang over Rampal’s investment fitness, and with the financial backing now confirmed for this disaster waiting to happen, alarm bells should already be ringing among major Western banks and investors who have anything to do with Ex-Im India.”

Yann Louvel, Climate and Energy coordinator of BankTrack, concluded: 


“The solar boom is under way in India, and the Indian government and Ex-Im India could have contributed to the development of renewables in Bangladesh. They are instead intent on sentencing the country to decades of coal dependency by building a coal plant which will contribute further to climate change, with Bangladesh facing some of the most acute and pressing climate risks.""

Nijmegen, Netherlands ",Banks risk breach of sustainability standards over Indonesian coal plant finance ,Crédit Agricole ,France,Cirebon 2 coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Indonesia,"
A planned USD 2 billion coal-fired power plant in Cirebon, Indonesia will have major social and environmental impacts not dealt with by the project sponsor, which should rule out Equator Principles banks from financing this project, finds a new briefing by BankTrack and Greenpeace. 

 
The briefing details the project’s failure to comply with the Equator Principles on various counts, and calls on the consortium of banks considering financing the deal, Credit Agricole, ING (also as financial adviser), Mizuho Financial Group, MUFG and SMBC – all signatories to the Equator Principles – not to finance the 1,000 megawatt Cirebon 2 plant. 

 

Cirebon 2, being developed by Cirebon Energi Prasarana, a consortium consisting of Marubeni (35%), Indika Energy (25%), Samtan (20%), Korea Midland Power (10%) and Chubu Electric (10%), is planned next to an existing coal plant, Cirebon 1, in northern West Java.

 

The Equator compliance briefing of BankTrack and Greenpeace finds that the project will lead to extensive loss of livelihoods of local farmers and fishermen, due to land seizures and the impacts of thermal pollution. The project will also lead to severe air pollution, directly threatening the health of nearby communities. Communities adjacent to the project were not properly consulted in advance about the potential impact of the project and are now suing the local government in court.

 

Since Cirebon 1 started firing in 2013, local fishermen, salt makers and farmers have suffered from declining harvests and income because of the air and thermal water pollution caused by the plant. Cirebon 2, proposed for operations right next door, will only worsen their suffering. These damaging impacts have not been sufficiently investigated by the owners of the plant or by the banks in the frame for financing, and local communities have not been properly consulted about the plans for the new plant.

 

Yann Louvel, climate and energy campaign coordinator at BankTrack said:

 

“The reputation of the Equator Principles as an adequate safeguard for the legitimate rights and interests of fence line communities has been badly tarnished by the financing of controversial projects like the Dakota Access Pipeline in the US and the Agua Zarca dam in Honduras, both ‘Equator compliant projects’ that nevertheless completely violated such community rights. While the Equator Principles have been severely trampled on in the Cirebon 2 preparation stage, this time the banks have not yet closed the deal, and still have time to step away from this deeply flawed project.”

 

As described in the new briefing, Cirebon 2 will not make use of several available technologies to reduce the emission of the dangerous air pollutants SO2, NOx and fine particles which result from coal burning. Such technologies are used by the lead Cirebon 2 consortium company Marubeni for coal plants in Japan.


Kim Schoppink, climate and energy campaigner at Greenpeace said:

 

“This is a shocking double standard and oversight. This new plant would dramatically worsen the air quality in Cirebon, while Cirebon residents are already suffering from air quality considered to be very unhealthy by the World Health Organization.” 

 

Financial close for Cirebon 2 is expected potentially as soon as the end of April. BankTrack and Greenpeace are calling on potential financing banks to respect their commitments under the Equator Principles and pull out of financing for the project.

Toronto ",First Nations across North America ask TD Bank to step away from financing of Kinder Morgan Pipeline,Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD Bank) ,Canada,Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion project (TMEP) ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,Canada,"
Grand Chief Serge Simon of the Mohawk Council of Kanesatake, a Mohawk community on the outskirts of Montreal, today delivered a message at TD Bank’s annual general meeting to warn shareholders, management and the board that TD is turning its back on First Nations communities by helping to finance Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain Expansion oil sands pipeline.
On behalf of the 122 First Nations and Tribes across North America that comprise the Treaty Alliance Against Tar Sands Expansion, he asked that TD step away from its role in raising money for the controversial pipeline. “I am here today with the message that coordinated Indigenous opposition from Quebec to British Columbia to North Dakota will stop the Kinder Morgan oil pipeline one way or another, like we did with Northern Gateway,” said Grand Chief Simon from inside the meeting.
TD is acting as the principal broker for Kinder Morgan, helping the company find investors – so far none have shown interest – to build the Trans Mountain Expansion tar sands pipeline and tanker project despite clear objections from First Nations in BC and Tribes in the Pacific Northwest. TD is also one of the main lenders to the Dakota Access pipeline project (and the biggest in Canada), lending $365 million to make the DAPL project possible.
“Right now our Nations do not understand how TD can brand itself as a socially responsible bank while playing a major role in the building of two oil pipelines that have a high likelihood of polluting our drinking water and land and undermining our ways of life,” said Chief Simon.
First Nations under the Treaty Alliance are asking TD to step away from both pipeline projects, including cancelling the $365 million loan to finance the Dakota Access pipeline project. The Treaty Alliance Against Tar Sands Expansion opposes the expansion of the Alberta tar sands and bars the passage of proposed tar sands pipeline and rail projects, including their associated tanker traffic, which threaten our water and coasts and would fuel catastrophic climate change effects.

The Israeli settlement enterprise has persisted for fifty years. Illegal under international law, the settlement enterprise continues at an accelerated pace; the approval of 6,000 new housing units since January 2017 is merely the latest manifestation.

",Europe’s biggest banks register €25 billion profit in tax havens,Banco Santander ,Spain,,,,"
Europe’s 20 biggest banks are registering over a quarter of their profits in tax havens – well out of proportion to the level of real economic activity that occurs there, according to a new report by Oxfam and the Fair Finance Guide International today.
The report, ‘Opening the Vaults,’ suggests the discrepancy may have arisen because some banks are using tax havens to avoid paying their fair share of tax, to facilitate tax dodging for their clients, or to circumvent regulations and legal requirements.   
The research was made possible by new EU transparency rules that require European banks to publish information on the profits they make and the tax they pay in every country they operate. The report finds: 

Tax havens account for 26 percent of the profits made by the 20 biggest European banks - an estimated €25 billion - but only 12 percent of banks’ turnover and 7 percent of the banks’ employees.  
Subsidiaries in tax havens are on average twice as lucrative for banks as those elsewhere.  For every €100 of activity, banks make €42 of profit in tax havens compared to a global average of €19.
Bank employees in tax havens appear to be 4 times more productive than the average bank employee – generating an average profit of €171,000 per year compared to just €45,000 a year for an average employee.
In 2015 European banks posted at least €628 million in profits in tax havens where they employ nobody. For example, the French bank BNP Paribas made €134 million tax-free profit in the Cayman Islands despite having no staff based there. 
Some banks are reporting profits in tax havens while reporting losses elsewhere. For example, Germany’s Deutsche Bank registered low profits or losses in many major markets in 2015 while booking almost €2 billion in profits in tax havens.   
Luxembourg and Ireland are the most favored tax havens, accounting for 29 percent of the profits banks posted in tax havens in 2015. The 20 biggest banks posted €4.9 billion of profits in the tiny tax haven of Luxembourg in 2015 – more than they did in the UK, Sweden and Germany combined.
Banks often pay little or no tax on the profits they post in tax havens. European banks paid no tax on €383 million of profit they posted in seven tax havens in 2015.  In Ireland, European banks paid an effective tax rate of no more than 6 percent – half the statutory rate – with three banks (Barclays, RBS and Crédit Agricole) paying no more than 2 percent.     

Manon Aubry, Oxfam’s Senior Tax Justice Advocacy Officer said: “New EU transparency rules give us a glimpse into the tax affairs of Europe’s biggest banks and it’s not a pretty sight. Governments must change the rules to prevent banks and other big businesses using tax havens to dodge taxes or help their clients dodge taxes.”
“All companies and individuals have a responsibly to pay their fair share of tax. Tax dodging deprives countries throughout Europe and the developing world of the money they need to pay for doctors, teachers and care workers,” said Aubry. 
Many countries are being cheated out of the money needed to tackle poverty and inequality by corporate tax dodgers, with poor countries being hit the hardest.  Tax dodging by multinational companies costs poor countries over €90 billion every year. This is enough money to provide an education for the 124 million children who aren’t in school and fund healthcare interventions that could prevent the deaths of at least six million children. 
Transparency measures, such as the EU rules on public country-by-country reporting, are vital tools in the global fight against tax dodging. However, a new European Commission proposal designed to extend public reporting beyond the banking sector is flawed. The proposal is limited to companies with a turnover of €750 million or more, a measure that would exclude up to 90 percent of multinationals, and does not require companies to report on their activities in all the countries they operate - including developing countries.   
“The EU’s transparency rules are starting to open up the often murky world of corporate taxation to public scrutiny.  These rules must now be extended to ensure all large corporations provide financial reports for every country where they operate. This will make it easier for all countries – including the poorest – to establish if companies are paying their fair share of tax or not,” said Aubry.

London ",Mozambican campaigners demand cancellation of secret debt before the IMF lends again,Credit Suisse ,Switzerland,,,,"
Campaigners in Mozambique have called for secret debts to be cancelled before the IMF lends to the country again, alongside a range of measures including public disclosure of the audit into the debts, mechanisms to hold leaders accountable for actions and greater tax collection from megaprojects in the country.
In a statement signed by 35 organisations in Mozambique, and supported by 31 international organisations including BankTrack, the groups say:

“The only sustainable way out of Mozambique’s economic crisis is through far greater transparency in borrowing and lending, and ensuring that any adjustment falls on those who are able to pay, and that Mozambique does not get trapped by an unpayable debt burden.”

The statement has been released at the same time as the Mozambique government was expected not to make payments on one of the secret debts on 21 March. An audit of the deals by US company Kroll is expected to be completed by 31 March. The statement calls for the full audit to be publicly disclosed. It also calls for:

“a clear framework for how political leaders will be held accountable if such a situation arises again”
“a commitment by both the government and IMF not to cut government spending on vital services and investment”
“a strong and convincing strategy for cutting overspending and anticorruption measures”
“a renegotiation of contracts with megaprojects to ensure that they are all paying a fair share of tax”
“cancellation of a significant reduction in debt owed by the government as a result ”.

Signatories to the statement include the Mozambique Budget Monitoring Forum, Mozambican Debt Group and the Transparency and Fiscal Justice Coalition. International supporters include the African Forum and Network on Debt and Development (Afrodad), Asian Peoples Movement on Debt and Development (APMDD), the European Network on Debt and Development (Eurodad), ActionAid International and Oxfam International, as well as the Jubilee Debt Campaign.
Mozambique’s debt crisis has come from revelations in April 2016 that money had been lent to companies in Mozambique, with government guarantees, without them being publicly disclosed or agreed by the Mozambican parliament. Furthermore, the fall in global commodity prices since mid-2014 has cut the Mozambique government’s revenue, and contributed to the meticais, the Mozambican currency, falling 60% against the dollar, rapidly increasing the size of foreign-owed debts.
In 2013, the London branches of Credit Suisse and VTB Capital arranged for the Mozambique government to borrow $850 million from international speculators, supposedly to pay for a tuna fishing fleet, with an interest rate of 8.5%. Unbeknown to most people at the time, Credit Suisse and VTB together also lent a further $1.1 billion, under English law, to two state owned companies in Mozambique, much of which is now reported to have been spent on military equipment.
From 2001 to 2014 Mozambique was one of the fastest growing economies in the world. This was based on a series of mega projects based around the extraction and export of resources such as fossil fuels and metals. In a report in 2015, Jubilee Debt Campaign showed how this high growth was not leading to significant poverty reduction and that the dependence on raw materials made the country vulnerable to a big fall in prices, which could lead to a debt crisis.
The first ever mega project was an aluminium smelter just outside Maputo. In 2013 Jubilee Debt Campaign showed how foreign companies and governments, including the UK, were making large amounts of money out of this factory, whilst tax exemptions meant the Mozambique government was left with almost nothing.
In December 2015, the IMF began lending money to Mozambique to pay off previous lenders, whilst keeping the country in debt.
Then in April 2016, the existence of the hidden debts was finally revealed by investigative journalists. None of the loans were approved by the Mozambique parliament, breaching the country’s constitution.
The revelation has led to the IMF suspending its loans, followed by the World Bank and western governments. The Financial Conduct Authority in the UK has been reported to be investigating the activities of Credit Suisse and VTB to see if they misled other lenders.
Mozambique’s debt is now thought to be $11.6 billion, 93% of GDP, and without the loans from the IMF and World Bank to pay off other lenders, the debt cannot be paid.
Once the audit by Kroll is released, negotiations are expected to begin between the Mozambique government, IMF and creditors over debt restructurings and future loans. The statement from groups in Mozambique is clear on the major changes which are needed before new money is lent.

Nijmegen ",ING first bank to sell Dakota Access Pipeline loan debt – BankTrack reaction,ING ,Netherlands,Dakota Access Pipeline ,energy distribution | oil and gas,United States,"
The sale announced yesterday by Dutch bank ING of its $120 million share of loan debt in the highly controversial Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) is a belated good move, according to private finance watchdog BankTrack, and should now be followed by the 16 other banks involved in the overall $2.5 billion DAPL credit facility.
Having previously dumped its shares in the DAPL project companies, ING’s announcement, which follows engagement with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, makes it the first bank to confirm it is offloading DAPL debt. ING has also committed to advocate for Indigenous rights in future project financing. 
Johan Frijns, director of BankTrack, said: 
“Thanks to the astonishing courage and stamina of the water protectors at Standing Rock, which has catalysed worldwide support and public pressure on all financiers of the pipeline, there is now huge momentum among investors to divest from DAPL and any company associated with it. In this context, ING’s decision to finally sell its direct loan to DAPL is only appropriate and a welcome signal to the market.
“However, as much as ING has engaged with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in recent weeks, this situation could have been avoided altogether if banks, when they were approached for funding, had conducted proper due diligence and had sought to engage with the tribe during their consideration of whether bankrolling DAPL was appropriate.
“The reputations of all banks involved have clearly taken a hammering due to their support for DAPL. With the pipeline now nearing completion, moves like this from ING will only be meaningful if banks make different decisions in the future and avoid stumbling into more fossil fuel infrastructure follies such as the Keystone XL and Enbridge Line 3 pipelines, or the Trans Adriatic Pipeline. Major banks have got to take heed of the DAPL debacle and ensure it marks the end of the line for their financing of destructive, unnecessary oil and gas pipelines. Given the level of intense public scrutiny generated by DAPL, no bank can afford to decide otherwise.”

",Safeguarding communities and the environment in Chinese investments,,,,,,"
Inclusive Development International is pleased to announce the publication of a new set of action resources for advocates on Chinese outbound investment and infrastructure finance.  Safeguarding People and the Environment in Chinese Investments: A Guide for Community Advocates, which IDI released today, is a practical guide to the policies, standards and guidelines that apply to Chinese outbound investment.
In recent years, China has become one of the most important sources of foreign direct investment and development finance in the world. Chinese companies play various roles in overseas projects, from research and design, to construction, development and operation. Chinese financial institutions make many overseas development projects possible by providing billions of dollars in loans, risk guarantees and equity investments.
This investment brings with it potential benefits, but also human rights, social and environmental risks. Communities impacted by Chinese investments, and the civil society groups that seek to support them, often encounter difficulties obtaining project information, communicating with developers and financiers, and raising concerns or complaints.
In response to bad publicity and challenges faced by companies when going out, over the past ten years, Chinese state institutions and industry groups have developed a formidable body of policies and guidelines that apply to Chinese companies developing, operating or financing overseas projects.  Yet, despite the promulgation of these new guidelines meant to promote sustainable development and prevent adverse impacts, China-based financiers and companies have continued to back development and investment projects across the world that have had devastating impacts on local communities and the environment. While the policy developments show promise, the challenge now is to promote their implementation, and in the longer term, their alignment with international human rights and environmental standards.
Understanding China’s financial institutions, companies and state actors responsible for the oversight of outbound investment is imperative if people on the receiving end of these investments are to have a say in the projects that affect them and the resources they depend upon.
This guide explains the key actors involved in Chinese overseas investment and describes the environmental and social standards and guidelines that apply. The guide provides practical tips on how these standards can be used in advocacy with relevant Chinese actors and institutions. IDI hopes that this resource will assist community advocates to put these standards to the test and demand that the rights of people affected by Chinese investments are respected and protected.
The guide can be downloaded here.
The policies, standards and guidelines covered in the guide are compiled on this page on IDI’s Following the Money to Justice website. New documents will be posted here as and when they are adopted.
In addition to these resources, IDI has published six fact sheets on the key takeaways from our 2016 report Making Inroads: Chinese Infrastructure Investment in ASEAN and Beyond, which are now available in six languages: English, Khmer, Vietnamese, Thai, Burmese and Chinese.
The full report and factsheets in six languages can be downloaded here.
IDI would like to thank Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung South East Asia, The McKnight Foundation and Planet Wheeler Foundation for supporting the research and development of these publications.

Stockholm, Sweden ",Scandinavian banks linked to violations of indigenous peoples’ rights in Borneo,Danske Bank ,Denmark,BHP Billiton ,mining - coal  | mining - non coal | oil and gas,Australia,"
Scandinavian banks invest hundreds of millions of dollars in companies that are linked to violations of indigenous peoples’ rights in Borneo. A new report from Swedwatch and Fair Finance Guide Sweden shows that the banks fail to comply with their own guidelines as they have not taken sufficient steps to respect the rights of indigenous peoples.
A new investigation shows that Scandinavian banks are investing hundreds of millions of dollars in companies linked to violations of indigenous peoples’ rights and the deforestation of rainforests in Borneo. The report Silent Approval is launched in conjunction with the Swedish premiere of the documentary film The Borneo Case, which shows the struggle of indigenous peoples in Borneo for their rights to be respected.

The situation in Borneo is alarming. People are being dispossessed from their land and forests without prior consultation or compensation. The fact that these companies’ owners, including banks, are not immediately demanding that the companies fully respect indigenous peoples’ rights is severe, says Frida Arounsavath, researcher at Swedwatch and author of the report.

The report Silent Approval is based on an extensive field study in Borneo. It examines the impacts of four companies on indigenous peoples’ rights and links to seven Scandinavian banks. The results of the study show that all the banks invest in several of the companies and that the banks have not acted responsibly. Some of the companies were also included in the ethical funds of the banks.

The banks have ambitious guidelines which state that they should protect indigenous peoples, but none of them passed a closer examination. It is a betrayal of both the indigenous peoples on Borneo and the banks’ customers, says Jakob König, project manager at Fair Finance Guide Sweden.

The destruction of Borneo’s rainforests has been going on for decades and has been referred to as one of the greatest environmental crimes of our time. Large areas have been destroyed and converted into palm oil plantations and mines, which has had severe impacts on the indigenous communities on the island. Across Borneo, people have lost their traditional livelihoods and seen their communities destroyed. Those defending the environment and rights of the indigenous peoples have been harassed, threatened and even killed.

According to the United Nation’s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, companies have a responsibility to respect human rights. Banks that invest in companies have a responsibility and opportunity to use their leverage to impact the situation on Borneo and set requirements for zero tolerance for violations of indigenous peoples’ rights.
About the report
The report Silent Approval - The role of banks linked to the crises faced by Borneo’s indigenous peoples and their forests has been developed by Fair Finance Guide and Swedwatch in association with Fair Action and the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation. The documentary film The Borneo Case will be premiered in Sweden in conjunction with the report.

San Francisco, Paris ","BNP Paribas bankrolling climate change, pollution, and wildlife extinction through Texas LNG project; low income and native communities targeted once again",BNP Paribas ,France,,,,"
Rainforest Action Network, Les Amis de la Terre France, and Save RGV from LNG have released a new report detailing major health, climate and wildlife impacts of the Texas LNG project, a fracked-gas export terminal proposed near one of the poorest communities in the United States. The organizations have called on French bank BNP Paribas and its U.S. subsidiary Bank of the West to pull the plug on this liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Texas’s Rio Grande Valley.


Flying in the face of their 2015 public commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement — which aimed at limiting global temperature rise to less than 2 degrees Celsius — French financial giant BNP Paribas is currently arranging finances for the Texas LNG project.


Texas LNG poses a serious health risk to nearby communities — largely low-income communities of color. According to the Rio Grande Valley Coalition for Healthy Children, an estimated $75 million in health impacts would be incurred by the community from the construction phase alone.


The Carrizo/Comecrudo Tribe would also lose historical sites of great cultural and archaeological importance through this project. Those sites would literally be bulldozed during construction. The Texas LNG project also threatens a vitally important wetland restoration area which is a critical habitat for multiple endangered species, including the ocelot. This would be fatal not only for wildlife, but would devastate the local tourist economy as well.


The Texas LNG project also represents a major step backwards for our nation’s progress toward a clean energy and strong economic future. The project locks in decades of energy production from a fuel source that is worse for the climate than coal — in fact, burning the gas exported from the Texas LNG facility would have the same climate impact as more than seven coal-fired power plants.


The new report, BNP Paribas vs. Communities and Climate - Supporting the Texas LNG Fracked-Gas Terminal Threatens the Rio Grande Valley, lays out the range of serious climate, environmental, and social impacts that would result from BNP Paribas’ continued support for the Texas LNG project. The report also details why BNP Paribas’ involvement with the Texas LNG project stands in clear contradiction to its own climate policies and calls into question its commitment to the Equator Principles, a framework for financial institutions to manage environmental and social risk.


The report authors demand that BNP Paribas and Bank of the West:

withdraw from their role as financial adviser for the project; 
commit not to finance the other fracked-gas terminals proposed in the Rio Grande Valley, and; 
adopt a public policy that prohibits financing for liquefied natural gas export at large.

“Through their support of the Texas LNG project, BNP Paribas now poses a serious threat to the families, the economy and the clean air and water in the Rio Grande Valley,” said Rainforest Action Network’s Jason Opeña Disterhoft. “Low-income communities of color will once again be paying the price for bank and fossil fuel profits through air and water pollution — not to mention living under the constant threat of leaks and explosions. This project would likely destroy a vital wetland restoration project, including critical habitat for multiple endangered species. BNP Paribas went looking for profit — but what they found is textbook social and environmental risk. They should withdraw from the Texas LNG project today. And unless they’re happy to absorb the serious reputational damage they would take from the BNP Paribas Group funding this massively destructive project, Bank of the West should make sure their parent company does the right thing.”


The proposed Texas LNG terminal is part of a massive new slate of planned extreme fossil fuel infrastructure in North America. The continent’s hydraulic fracturing boom of the last decade has not only contaminated water and damaged community health, it has also left the fossil fuel industry with a huge glut of gas. To ease that oversupply, corporations are looking to exports, in the form of liquefied natural gas. There are currently two existing fracked-gas export terminals in North America — but there are an appalling 60 more in the planning stages. Within the United States, the majority of those proposed are in the Gulf Coast, the country’s far too frequent, low-income “sacrifice zone” for building fossil fuel infrastructure.
“Since 2015, BNP reduced its support to coal in the name of fighting climate change. But any financial institution attempting to meet the Paris Accord goals by solely abandoning financing for coal is at best a mistake — and at worst a scam,” said Lucie Pinson of Les Amis de La Terre France. “Burning the gas exported from the Texas LNG project would create CO2 emissions equivalent to 3.5 coal-fired plants, or even seven coal-fired plants if methane emissions are taken into account. BNP Paribas must not only withdraw from this project but must also immediately commit to not support new LNG export projects.”


“I am greatly concerned with Texas LNG's plan. I live and teach at a high school with nearly 2,000 students, just a few miles where the pipelines will be and downwind from their emissions,” said Patrick Anderson, a local resident and member of the grassroots organization Save RGV From LNG. “They will risk the health and safety of thousands of people from fracking, hundreds of miles of pipelines, and operating close to a highly populated area and popular tourist destination. Texas LNG will destroy wildlife habitat, and be one of the largest polluters in Texas. Supporting Texas LNG financially, or otherwise, means placing money and profit above our livelihood, our children, and our environment we cherish.” 


“The wetland restoration of the Bahia Grande that began in 2005 is one of the best things to occur in the Rio Grande Valley since the arrival of the railroad,” said Robert A. Radnik, of San Benito, TX, also a member of Save RGV from LNG. “This wetland restoration should not only be protected, it should be expanded and allowed to mature for the benefit of all who live here, vacation here or just migrate through. Investment must be encouraged to look toward an existence with renewable energy and a sustainable environment and not attempt to harvest profit from extraction industries that threaten that future.”


Exporting gas as LNG requires an energy intensive process of transporting, purifying, and cooling it into a liquid via a maze of pipelines and export terminals as large as 560 soccer fields, from which it is shipped overseas on tankers 300 yards (275 meters) long. The fossil fuel industry touts natural gas, including LNG, as a “bridge fuel” — a less carbon-intensive alternative to coal. But during the LNG process, up to 5 percent of methane escapes into the atmosphere — and methane is a greenhouse gas over 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide. This makes exported LNG worse for the climate than coal.


BNP Paribas was contacted in October 2016 urging their withdrawal from the Texas LNG project. To date we have received no public response.


Aside from BNP Paribas, the only bank that has been publicly named as financing any of the three planned terminals in the Rio Grande Valley is Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC), which is financial advisor and mandated lead arranger for the Rio Grande LNG terminal, owned by NextDecade LLC. SMBC has proudly claimed to be first in North America in terms of number of LNG deals as of August 2015. SMBC was contacted in October 2016 urging their withdrawal from the Rio Grande LNG project. To date we have received no public response.

",Leading banks under fire for misrepresenting human rights responsibilities,Barclays ,United Kingdom,,,,"
Update: links to the Thun Group's response to the criticisms detaield here are available at the end of this article. 
A group of eleven major banks has met with a wave of criticism from civil society, academics, the UN Working Group on Business and Human Rights (“the UN Working Group”) and Prof. John Ruggie, the architect of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (“the UNGPs”), after publishing a paper on the human rights responsibilities of banks.
The Discussion Paper, released on 25 January by the Thun Group of banks, set out the banks’ view of their responsibilities under the UNGPs, the global standard for managing the human rights impacts of businesses. It followed up an earlier discussion paper released in 2013, which was welcomed by civil society groups including BankTrack.
However the new Discussion Paper was described as “deeply problematic” by civil society groups for “appearing to sideline the advice of UN agencies”, while Prof. Ruggie was “deeply troubled” by the paper, and the UN Working Group expressed concerns that it “may undermine attempts by banks and others to implement their responsibility to respect human rights”.
An open letter coordinated by BankTrack, calling on the Thun Group to withdraw and reconsider the paper, was supported by over 30 civil society organisations and academics, including Oxfam, Greenpeace, Global Witness and the OECD Watch network. The letter states: “We consider that the premises on which the paper is based are fundamentally flawed, and regret that it has either intentionally or unintentionally omitted to take into account authoritative guidance, including by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.” 
Following the letter, Prof. John Ruggie, Berthold Beitz Professor in Human Rights and International Affairs at the Harvard Kennedy School, published his own comments on the paper on 21 February. Prof Ruggie stated: “It is exemplary that a group of major banks is undertaking important work on the application of the UNGPs to its sector. But I fear that the misconstruing of core elements of the UNGPs and their implications in this paper may do serious damage and risks setting back some of the innovative work that we are seeing from individual banks. Therefore, I would urge the Group to reflect on these issues and consider publishing a future paper more in keeping with the core elements of the UNGPs.”
And most recently, on 23 February, the UN Working Group, which promotes the implementation of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, also responded, calling on the Thun Group banks to revise the paper “in order to align it with the UNGPs.” The Working Group stated: “The Thun Group’s efforts to explore practical implications of the UNGPs are welcome … However, such practice tools which seek to interpret the meaning of the UNGPs in a sector-specific context should be subject to a process of consultation and review by other stakeholders in order to ensure accuracy, robustness and legitimacy.”
BankTrack called on the Thun Group to proceed on the basis of consultation with civil society and other stakeholders in 2013. Following this, the Thun Group committed to elaborate a stakeholder engagement strategy, although it has not yet done so.
The Thun Group discussion paper was endorsed by Barclays, BBVA, BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse AG, Deutsche Bank, ING, JPMorgan, RBS, Standard Chartered, UBS Group AG, and UniCredit.

Tokyo, Japan and Nijmegen, Netherlands ",Japanese and Singaporean banks step in to finance Indonesian coal plant in face of opposition from communities and environmentalists,Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) ,Japan,Tanjung Jati-B 2 (TJB2) coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Indonesia,"
As financial close was announced on the Tanjung Jati B 2 (TJB2) coal expansion power project in Indonesia yesterday, BankTrack, Friends of the Earth Japan and 350.org Japan criticised the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and several Japanese and Singaporean banks for their support for the project. 
JBIC’s approval of a USD1.7 billion loan agreement for the project, with further backing from the “big three” Japanese commercial banks - Mizuho Bank, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation – as well as other Japanese banks and Singapore’s OCBC, comes after French banks Société Générale and Crédit Agricole withdrew from the bank consortium in December. 
The building of two new coal power units will only make the already hard-felt impacts of the existing Tanjung Jati B coal power station worse. The local fishing community are among the strongest opponents of the proposed expansion to Tanjung Jati-B due to reduced catches since the plant has been in operation; damage to the coral reef; collisions between fishing boats and coal transport barges; and the lack of filters for water intake so fish are sucked into the cooling system .  This expansion will also worsen the impacts of air pollution, a horrendous prospect given that a Greenpeace report has estimated that the first four units are already responsible for 1,020 premature deaths per year because of respiratory infections caused by air pollution from the plant. 
Hozue Hatae, Public Finance and Environment researcher for Friends of the Earth Japan, said:
“We strongly condemn the financing of the TJB2 expansion project by JBIC and Japan’s commercial banks. This is another big black mark for the Japanese government and for banks which are helping to build new coal power plants across Asia when doing so is totally incompatible with the Paris Agreement and a 2°C world. This comes less than a year after the financing of the controversial Batang coal power plant in Indonesia and at the same time as the expansion of another Indonesian coal plant, Cirebon 2, is being considered by the same financial institutions. In addition to the aspect of climate change, local residents have already suffered from a major impact on their livelihoods, farming and fishing, in each project. JBIC and other banks must urge the companies to take effective measures to solve these existing problems before they decide on any loan for a new plant.” 
Yann Louvel, Climate and Energy Campaign Coordinator for BankTrack, said: 
“French banks were also initially supposed to join the banking consortium, but BNP Paribas withdrew from the project in 2015 while Société Générale and Crédit Agricole dropped out last December to fulfill their new climate commitments not to finance any new coal plants. It’s therefore all the more shocking to see that Singaporean bank OCBC and other Japanese banks replaced them shortly after in order to close the financing of this dodgy deal. All the financial institutions involved will share the responsibility for the climate and health impacts of this project. Instead of further deepening Indonesia’s dependence on coal for decades to come, they must rather help the country develop its huge renewables potential. We call on them to change course and to immediately withdraw from the Cirebon 2 expansion plan.”

",Financing land grab: the direct involvement of Israeli banks in the Israeli settlement enterprise,Bank Hapoalim ,Israel,,,,"
Israeli banks provide the financial infrastructure for all the activities of companies, governmental agencies and individuals linked to the continuing occupation of Palestinian land.
The following report focuses on the central role that Israeli banks play in construction and infrastructure projects in West Bank and East Jerusalem settlements and in providing loans to regional and local councils of settlements in the West Bank. The findings of this report reveal that all Israeli banks except Dexia Israel provide special loans to construction and infrastructure projects in settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. In addition, all Israeli banks with no exception provide loans and financial services to local and regional councils of Israeli settlements in the West Bank.
Israeli banks provide loans, guarantees and credit to various construction firms for the explicit purpose of constructing housing projects in Israeli settlements in the West Bank and in East Jerusalem. The terms of these loans are established in “accompaniment agreements” (heskemey livuy), which are special agreements between the banks and construction companies for financial accompaniment from a project’s first stages to its completion. If the project goes bankrupt, the bank becomes the owner of the property, which is on occupied Palestinian land.
Israeli banks also provide credit to companies that execute infrastructure projects in the West Bank, while holding as collateral the company’s rights in contracts and the company’s rights to receive funds from different Israeli authorities.
In addition, regional and local councils of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank depend on financial services provided by Israeli banks. Such services include opening and managing bank accounts, transferring funds and providing loans. Through these loans, settlement councils can sustain themselves, develop and expand existing settlements, build facilities for the benefit of the settlers and attract more Jewish-Israelis to reside in the occupied territory.
Furthermore, most Israeli banks have several branches in Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The different banks operate 33 branches in those settlements, through which they provide financial services to settlers and commercial companies in settlements, thereby enabling the continued maintenance and development of the settlements.
In order to expose the complicity of Israeli banks in maintaining and developing the Israeli settlement enterprise in the occupied West Bank, the Who Profits Research Center has used publically available documents and relevant publications, including official registry records and information published by the banks, local and regional settlement councils and construction companies involved.
Who Profits is dedicated to exposing the most up-to-date information on corporate involvement in the Israeli occupation. Therefore, this report focuses on the most recent examples of the role played by Israeli banks in the construction of illegal Israeli settlements. However, the examples herein are just a drop in the ocean: Israeli banks have been involved in settlement construction projects since the very inception of the settlement enterprise.
It is indisputable that Israeli banks provide the financial foundation for the construction, sustainment and development of settlements. The following report by Who Profits clearly demonstrates that Israeli banks not only provide such services and enable such activities, they are also fully aware of the type of activities for which their financial assistance is being used. Moreover, Israeli banks reap profits from the subordination of the Palestinian financial sector as a captive market.
From a more general perspective, it can be said that all aspects of Israeli control over the occupied Palestinian territory require a financial foundation, and that none of the financial activities conducted by individuals, organizations, government institutions and commercial companies could take place without the active support of the banks mentioned in this report.

Warsaw, San Francisco ",Coal Roadshow: JPMorgan Chase propping up new coal plant in Poland,BNP Paribas ,France,Ostroleka C coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Poland,"
ENERGA Finance AB – the Baa1/BBB rated finance subsidiary of ENERGA S.A., the Polish state-owned utility – started a roadshow this week to convince investors that the bond issuance with which it is planning to raise a minimum of EUR 250 million has nothing to do with a 1000 MW coal-fired power plant in Poland that the parent company is developing with another coal-heavy state-owned utility, ENEA S.A. Two banks – JPMorgan Chase and BNP Paribas – are arranging the deal, putting their credibility up for sale.


Rainforest Action Network, Foundation “Development YES - Open-Pit Mines NO”, and other civil society organizations consider deals like this a climate test for how seriously international financial institutions take their own policies as well as the Paris climate agreement.


Less than one year ago, JPMorgan Chase committed that the bank “will not provide project financing or other forms of asset-specific financing where the proceeds will be used to develop a new coal-fired power plant located in a high income OECD country” – including Poland. Yet JPMorgan Chase has now signed up to underwrite bonds for a wholly owned subsidiary of Energy SA, whose electricity generation mix is 68% coal, and is searching for ways to finance its recently revitalized plans for the Ostrołęka C 1000 MW coal power plant, which will cost EUR 1.5 billion.


ENERGA aims to raise capital by launching eurobonds through its wholly-owned, Sweden-registered subsidiary whose sole purpose is to secure corporate finance for the mother company with no strings attached. The purpose of the bonds is that the money raised will be for the utility’s “general corporate purposes” – and it shouldn’t be difficult for JPMorgan Chase to see what that means when this one planned coal plant would double ENERGA S.A.’s coal generation capacity.


Poland is the last country in the European Union where new coal-fired power plants are still planned. It is also the country with an energy system most heavily controlled by the state. As one of the four state-controlled coal heavy energy utilities, ENERGA S.A. is also in talks with the European Investment Bank about financing a hybrid bond launch worth EUR 250 million that would also enable ENERGA to proceed with the Ostrołęka C project. ENERGA S.A. first launched eurobonds in March 2013, when BNP Paribas, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and HSBC arranged for the company to obtain EUR 500 million.


Back in 2012, ENERGA had shelved its power plant construction plans, but in November 2015 the plans for the Ostrołęka coal plant were restarted. According to the energy consulting company Ecofys, any new coal-fired power plant is inconsistent with a 2°C scenario, and yet there are currently more than 2,000 coal fired power plants under preparation to be built in the world. If all were to be built, according to Climate Action Tracker, coal power emissions in 2030 would be 400% higher than what is consistent with limiting warming to under 2°C.
Kuba Gogolewski, Finance Campaigner at Foundation “Development YES - Open-Pit Mines NO”, said:


""By supporting ENERGA's bond issue while it is building a coal plant that would more than double its coal generation capacity, and by helping to keep afloat the country’s collapsing mining sector, JPMorgan and BNP Paribas clearly show that profit comes first and that their climate commitments only go skin deep. Polish communities aspire to a healthier and cleaner future and ENERGA Finance will fund the opposite. Investors buying ENERGA Finance bonds have to know that they will take part of the responsibility for stalling the diversification of the Polish energy system away from coal and keeping Polish citizens away from clean air to breathe. We call on all investors to stay away from ENERGA Finance eurobond launch, and on JPMorgan and BNP Paribas to cut their ties with ENERGA until it drops its coal plans.”

Jason Opeña Disterhoft, Climate and Energy Senior Campaigner, Rainforest Action Network, said:


“The ENERGA bond issue is a test of JPMorgan Chase’s seriousness on climate change. As we approach the one-year anniversary of its new coal policy, the bank is looking to exploit a loophole to finance a new coal-fired power plant in an OECD country that is already locked into coal dependence. Now it has to choose: does it care more about coal or the climate?”

Brussels ","Trans-Adriatic Pipeline a major risk for banks, warns new analysis ",Société Générale ,France,Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) ,oil and gas,- international -,"
An analysis published today by the finance watchdog groups Counter Balance and BankTrack has warned potential commercial bank investors to steer clear of the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) owing to the project’s non-compliance with the Equator Principles, a set of risk management guidelines for project finance adopted by 89 commercial banks around the world. 
Based on a range of evidence from Albania and Greece, where TAP construction is under way and posing threats to numerous communities, and Italy, where the €5 billion gas pipeline’s construction is stalled due to extensive local and regional opposition as well as ongoing legal challenges, the new analysis comes a day ahead of the latest high-level Southern Gas Corridor Advisory Council meeting in Azerbaijan which will involve representation from the corridor’s transit countries, the European Commission, the USA and international public development banks. 
According to the TAP company, the 879 kilometre pipeline project will affect approximately 19,060 plots of land and approximately 45,000 land owners and users in Albania, Greece and Italy. At least 13 complaints from affected individuals and stakeholder groups about the TAP company’s implementation of the project in Albania, Greece and Italy have already been submitted to the European Investment Bank, which has been considering the TAP project for finance since August 2015.
Reflecting these complaints, the NGO analysis identifies problematic issues related to compensation for land owners, the TAP company’s heavy-handed approach to land acquisition and pipeline routing, and – in Italy – the project’s fundamental lack of preparedness which has resulted in a string of legal disputes still awaiting verdicts in the Italian courts.
Xavier Sol, director of Counter Balance, said: 
“The European Commission’s alarming cosying up to the hardline Azerbaijan regime for more fossil fuels which Europe doesn’t need is now resulting in serious, direct headaches for Europeans, as our new analysis of the TAP project reveals. The likes of the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development which are considering finance for TAP should be aware of these ongoing failures in the project construction. If they should choose to rubber stamp TAP in its current state, it would not give the project a clean bill of health for private banks to enter into the financing.”  
Yann Louvel, Climate and Energy campaign coordinator at BankTrack, said:
“Private banks need to be aware about the shoddy way in which the TAP project is proceeding on the ground, far removed from the public relations fanfare ringing out from the governments involved. Serious impacts to communities and the environment are cropping up and not getting resolved. For banks which have signed up to the Equator Principles, this has to mean that TAP is a no-go investment. The reputation of the Equator Principles has suffered recently from the Dakota Access Pipeline debacle in the US, and banks need to make sure these lessons are learned when it comes to TAP.”

Notes for editors:
1. See the analysis published today describing the TAP project’s non-compliance with the Equator Principles.
2. The proposed TAP project is the western extension of the Southern Gas Corridor, planned to export natural gas from the Shah Deniz II field in the Caspian Sea to western markets. TAP is intended to run for 879 kilometres in total across northern Greece (545 km), Albania (215 km), the Adriatic Sea (105 km), make landfall in Italy at a small, popular beach in San Foca, and conclude with a short pipeline section (8 km). A further 55 km pipeline is planned to connect TAP to the Italian gas network. The TAP company’s current shareholding is comprised of BP (20%), SOCAR (20%), Snam (20%), Fluxys (19%), Enagás (16%) and Axpo (5%).

London ",Investors urged to catalyse climate-credible business models in the banking sector,,,,,,"
Investors should engage and use their voting rights to demand that major banks play a proactive role in the low carbon transition, according to a new report published by ShareAction. “At a portfolio-wide level, the only way that investors can protect themselves against high-risk climate scenarios is through a timely and economy-wide decarbonisation. Banks are uniquely placed to help catalyse this transformation. Fiduciary investors seeking to mitigate exposure to climate risks have everything to gain from strategic engagement with the banking sector,” says Catherine Howarth, Chief Executive of ShareAction.
The report, entitled Banking on a Low Carbon Future, provides detailed guidance for investors wishing to question banks on how they are addressing the business risks and opportunities associated with climate change and the low carbon transition. The launch sets the scene for a 2017 season of collaborative activity by institutional investors to ensure the boards of banks are listening and responding to climate risk. ShareAction's agenda for banks is designed to breathe life into the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Banking is picked out as a sector of special strategic importance in the TCFD's interim report but historically banking has had little attention from climate-engaged investors, whose energies have been focussed almost exclusively on high carbon emitters.
ShareAction's report makes tough recommendations for banks: wind down the provision of financial services to high carbon activities and to clients who fail to transition to lower carbon business models; and stop financing coal-dependent companies altogether. The report calls on banks to scale up financing of sectors and activities that facilitate low carbon growth. Banks are also encouraged to bring their lobbying weight to bear in support of public policies that accelerate decarbonisation of the global economy.
António Simões, Chief Executive Officer of HSBC Bank, says: ""It is critical that the entire financial services industry really gets behind the global consensus on climate change achieved at COP 21 in Paris. The important thing right now is that the climate agenda becomes an integral part of our day-to-day decision making process.  Banks working to ensure the transition to a low carbon future is vital to achieve this aim.‎""
In the report, Lauren Compere, Director of Shareholder Engagement at Boston Common Asset Management, says: “As climate risk becomes recognised as critical to banks, investors want to know whether this risk is being managed at the highest levels of the organisation…Addressing these challenges will require a significant break from ‘business as usual’. Please join us in using the tools and questions provided by ShareAction and others to expand investor dialogue and action with the financial sector on climate risk.” At the launch event at the Guildhall, speakers include Roger Gifford, Head of SEB UK and Chairman of the City of London’s Green Finance Initiative, Sarah Breeden, Executive Director of the Prudential Regulation Authority and Edward Bonham Carter, Vice Chairman of Jupiter Fund Management. 
“Hundreds of thousands of people are demanding that the world’s biggest banks take serious action on climate change,” says Johan Frijns, Director of BankTrack. “Many of these people will have savings that have been invested in those companies. Big investors like our pension funds should take heed of ShareAction’s guidelines, and urge banks to step up their game and stop financing climate-destructive activities.”

London ",New HSBC ‘no deforestation’ policy first step towards sustainable palm oil finance,HSBC ,United Kingdom,,,,"
HSBC today published a new ‘No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ policy covering its financing of palm oil companies. 
The move by HSBC – Europe’s largest bank and a major funder of palm oil companies – follows an investigation by Greenpeace that linked it to companies destroying Indonesia’s rainforests.  Hundreds of thousands of people joined the campaign to change the bank’s policies, including 30,000 HSBC customers.
Annisa Rahmawati, forest campaigner for Greenpeace Indonesia, said:

“Our rainforest is being carved up at a frightening rate and high street banks all over the world are funding this destruction. HSBC's commitment to break its ties to destructive palm oil companies is a good first step and Greenpeace will be watching closely to make sure it delivers. This also sends a clear signal that other global banks must follow suit.”
In its new policy, HSBC has made stronger commitments to refuse finance for companies that clear forests and peatlands. If adopted across the banking sector, the policy would play a part in ending the role of banks in financing destructive palm oil companies.
The new policy will require HSBC customers to:

Commit to protecting natural forest and peat by 30 June 2017.
Identify and protect forests and peat in new plantations prior to commencing new development.
Provide independent verification of their No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation commitments by 31 December 2018.

A shift towards making palm oil financing more sustainable is long overdue. The rate of deforestation in Indonesia has overtaken Brazil. Last year, orangutans were moved from ‘endangered’ to ‘critically endangered’ on the IUCN’s listings.  A recent study estimated that smoke from forest fires, which are fuelled by plantation companies clearing forests and draining peatlands, caused more than 100,000 premature deaths across South East Asia in 2015. 
A first critical test for the banking sector will be its response to South Korean conglomerate POSCO Daewoo, which is preparing to clear an area of Papuan rainforest larger than Cambridge.  New satellite images of PT Bio Inti Agrindo (a subsidiary of POSCO Daewoo) taken on 13 January 2017 show an estimated 4,000 hectares of rainforest crisscrossed by newly constructed roads, a key indicator of imminent plantation development. 
Research by Greenpeace showed that in the past five years, 13 banks – including HSBC, BNP Paribas and Standard Chartered – have been involved in providing POSCO Daewoo and its subsidiaries with loans totalling nearly US$3.6bn and bonds totalling over US$5bn. 
“It is clear from these shocking images that HSBC’s client POSCO Daewoo intends to destroy a vast area of rainforest. This is the critical test for HSBC. It cannot in good conscience continue to fund POSCO Daewoo if it continues to carve up Papua’s rainforest.” said Annisa.
Greenpeace will today be writing to all of the other banks exposed by the ‘Dirty Bankers’ investigation to ask what action they will be taking, in light of HSBC’s new policy, to ensure they are not funding deforestation.

Hamburg/Berlin ",Multi-billion euro investments out of control: How banks continue to finance violations of human rights and environmental norms,BNP Paribas ,France,Wilmar International ,agriculture - palm oil ,Singapore,"
On the occasion of the forthcoming “World Day of Social Justice” on 20 February 2017, the Berlin NGO FACING FINANCE e.V., presents the report, Dirty Profits 5. It shows: major European banks support and profit from companies that violate social and environmental standards at the expense of people and the environment. The scale of the total financial transactions found is over €52 billion.


“The Dirty Profits Report has again confirmed that self-regulation of banks and companies, behind closed doors, is insufficient to ensure the observance of human rights, environmental, and anti-corruption standards,” says Thomas Küchenmeister, Managing Director of Facing Finance


The Dirty Profits 5 report includes research and important case study contributions by respected international organisations, including for example, Transparency International, Greenpeace, and Human Rights Watch. A total of 12 authors from eight countries have documented dozens of cases of human rights violations, corruption, exploitation, and environmental destruction (including contributing to climate

change). The cases cover 14 globally operating companies, including Bayer, VW, BP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. and five major European banks (Deutsche Bank, UBS, ING, BNP Paribas and HSBC). The finance provided by the five major banks, in relation to these 14 companies, is detailed in the report. The five banks held shares and bonds of the investigated companies to the value of €5.8 billion.


The selected European banks provided the 14 companies with capital of €46.9 billion between January 2013 and August 2016 through the underwriting of shares and bonds and provision of loans. These loans are often given as ‘general corporate purpose’, without placing sustainability requirements on the company’s operations. This report shows that major banks provided substantial loans to VW after revelations regarding the emissions scandal.


According to Jan Schulz from Facing Finance, “It is unacceptable that after widely recognised concerns related to the VW emissions scandal were made public, many of the banks in the Dirty Profits have provided VW with loans, apparently without restrictions.” Similarly Freeport-McMoran, Norilsk Nickel and SNC-Lavalin have been provided with loans despite long-term environmental and corruption issues.


“64 percent of the investigated companies have one or more documented cases involving environmental or climate destruction,” claims Julia Dubslaff, leader of the Facing Finance project Faire Rente. For 42 percent of the companies researched, corruption cases have been documented in their operations and, for 57 percent of companies, human rights violations. The fact that eight of the 14 companies are

signatories to the UN Global Compact, which specifies minimum environmental and social standards, seemingly does not prevent these occurrences.


“With this report we are pressing for better regulation surrounding sustainability and  transparency of the financial industry. Particularly at a time where a concerning amount of deregulation is occurring in the US, including possible deregulation of the financial industry,” says Lesley Burdock, editor of Dirty Profits 5.


The focus of the report is on a wide range of companies, including the VW diesel scandal and its worldwide, unprecedented, and organised deception of customers and regulators at the expense of people and the environment. In addition, four global mining companies are investigated, including Freeport-McMoRan whose Grasberg mine dumps 150,000 tonnes of tailings waste into the surrounding area every day, using what is known as riverine tailings disposal, leading to large scale ecosystem destruction. Approximately 23 institutional investors have excluded Freeport based on their environmental concerns. However all five of the major banks investigated have directly funded Freeport-McMoRan.


The Dirty Profits report will be presented on February 9th in Hamburg at 19:00 at the Lichthof der Stabi Hamburg in cooperation with the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung.

Nijmegen ","Over 700,000 people demand banks stop financing the Dakota Access Pipeline",,,Dakota Access Pipeline ,energy distribution | oil and gas,United States,"
Over 700,000 people have signed one of six petitions to banks financing the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). The figure includes individuals who collectively report having over $2.3 billion invested in these banks through checking, mortgage, and credit card accounts, which they are ready to divest if the banks continue financing DAPL. Thousands have already closed their accounts and defunded over $55 million and counting.
With the Trump government exerting massive pressure on the US Army Corps of Engineers to ignore its own procedures and immediately issue the last permit needed to construct the final part of the Pipeline, and with Energy Transfer Partners fully intending to “complete construction of the pipeline without any additional rerouting in and around Lake Oahe”, pressure is mounting on the banks involved, in a last attempt to prevent a bitter confrontation at the project site.
The 17 banks involved in directly financing the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, and the many others providing credits to the companies behind the project, continue to find themselves targeted by campaigners demanding an end to their support for the project. Activists this week were showing up in person at bank headquarters in New York, Montreal, Munich, Madrid, Moscow, Amsterdam, San Fransisco and elsewhere, demanding the withdrawal of the 17 banks involved in the construction loan to ETP (Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, BayernLB, BBVA, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Crédit Agricole, DNB ASA, ICBC, ING, Intesa Sanpaolo, Mizuho Bank, Natixis, SMBC, Société Générale, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, TD Bank, Wells Fargo).  
In response, banks including ABN AMRO and ING have made public statements that they are ready to reconsider their relation with ETE . However, at the same time campaigners noted with dismay the renewed involvement of a number of banks in a new $2.2 billion refinancing loan to Energy Transfer Equity, led by Credit Suisse.
As pressure is mounting on the financiers of the project, The Sacred Stone Camp and their allies have vowed to stand their ground as long as DAPL construction equipment remains on Oceti Sakowin treaty land. The global coalition targeting the DAPL financiers has vowed to continue pressure on all banks funding fossils throughout 2017.
Quotes in support of the global DefundDAPL campaign:
Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault II said: ""By attempting to fast track DAPL, President Trump has made it clear that his priorities lie with his wealthy contributors rather than the public interest. Banks now have an opportunity to take a stand against this reckless assault on our treaty rights and water, or be complicit and continue to lose millions.""
Dallas Goldtooth, Keep It In the Ground Campaigner, Indigenous Environmental Network, said: “President Trump wishes to fast-track the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline, against federal law and tribal treaty rights. Indigenous nations and communities will not be the sacrifice zones for President Trump's fossil fuel regime. We remain steadfast in our defense of our inherent rights and the protection of Mother Earth and we implore our allies to stand with us. We must remind the investors of this pipeline that they, via their financing, are threatening the lives of water protectors and it’s time to be held accountable for that.""
Judith LeBlanc, Director, Native Organizers Alliance and member of the Caddo Tribe of Oklahoma, said: “The decision to build the Dakota Access Pipeline was made in the halls of power by a handful representing banks and corporations willing to sacrifice Mother Earth for profit. The decision to stop it will be made by the many, all across the world, who know that Mother Earth and water give us life. Time is now for investors to also stand for Mother Earth. We started at Standing Rock, now Standing Rock is everywhere.”
Chase Iron Eyes, lead attorney, Lakota People’s Law Project, said: ""It's inspiring to see the power of global currency being leveraged in the frontline movement at Standing Rock. Separate fights -- defending clean drinking water, upholding constitutional freedoms, creating a new energy economy -- are becoming one as people recognize and respond to the problem of banks using their money to finance human rights violations and brutality. If money rules the day then we will bring compassion to our capital by divesting.""
Angus Wong, Campaign Manager, SumOfUs: ""Trump's green light of the destructive Dakota Pipeline is a corporate scheme to enrich himself and his corporate friends. But we know targeting banks to stop financing this dangerous pipeline works -- two days after we delivered hundreds of thousands of SumOfUs members’ signatures to Norway-based DNB bank headquarters in November, it pulled its assets in the pipeline. We hope DNB will again demonstrate leadership by committing to withdraw its project funding.""
Erich Pica, President, Friends of the Earth US, said: “The voices of Indigenous peoples have been ignored for too long – by the US government, corporations and big banks. By not acknowledging Indigenous peoples, these banks are perpetuating a pattern of colonialism and failing to respect Indigenous peoples’ rights to Free, Prior and Informed Consent.”
Vanessa Green, Director of DivestInvest Individual, said: ""DAPL is simply the wrong kind of investment, and people don't want their money behind it. With government mandates to scale up clean energy investments, a market increasingly supportive of a low carbon future, and unprecedented consumer and investor interest in moving money into climate and community solutions, the question now is which banks will lose the most in this historic energy transition.""
Mary Sweeters, Climate Campaigner with Greenpeace USA, said: ""People across the world have pledged their solidarity with the Indigenous communities who reject this dirty pipeline and the threat it poses to the water and climate. The banks must choose whether they want to continue to invest their money in yesterday or listen to the millions of people who stand with Standing Rock.”
Fran Teplitz, Executive Co-director of Green America, said: “Now more than ever we need to move away from destructive fossil fuel pipelines and pursue a clean energy future. Indigenous communities are demonstrating heroic leadership by protecting water, the source of life, from the dangers of pipelines. We call on the government and banks to halt support for the Dakota Access Pipeline immediately.”
Kristen Perry, Climate Justice Montreal Organizer, said: “We need to stop funding projects which endanger water, land, and our communities, and instead follow the lead of defenders calling for direct action and support. It is crucial that we center justice for communities on the frontline of the crisis and the forefront of solutions, and pushing for divestment and the defunding of destructive projects is a tangible way for us to take action in solidarity with Indigenous communities across colonial borders.”
Yago Martínez from Ecologistas en Acción, said: “DAPL is not only a clear violation of Indigenous people’s rights but also a major climate threat. We believe in the importance of international solidarity to achieve goals leading to global and climatic justice, and therefore we cannot fail to stand with Standing Rock. We must raise our voices. Banks from all over the world are involved in this destructive project and they must be held accountable.”
Ruth Breech, Campaigner, Rainforest Action Network, said: “The Dakota Access Pipeline is a morally and financially bankrupt project. If banks value Indigenous rights and free, prior and informed consent, they will leave this project immediately. We don't need another pipeline. We need financial institutions that are willing to take a stand and do the right thing-divest from the Dakota Access Pipeline.”
Leila Salazar López, Executive Director, Amazon Watch, said: ""Indigenous peoples across the Americas, from Standing Rock to the Amazon, have for years been standing up against the destructive, racist practices of the fossil fuel industry. The number of people withdrawing their money from the banks supporting the Dakota Access pipeline is a clear signal to those banks that destructive fossil fuel projects are a bad financial, social, and environmental investment.""
Regine Richter of urgewald Germany, said: “European banks involved in financing DAPL might think they are far enough away and can get off the hook from the protests. But here as well people are enthusiastic to stand with Standing Rock and protest against the loan, as we do this week at BayernLB.”
Johan Frijns, Director BankTrack, said: “The Dakota Access Pipeline is becoming a litmus test for all banks involved on how they let environmental, social and human impacts weigh in when considering finance for a particular project. In this case, the ongoing violation of the rights of the Sioux Tribe leave them no other option but to withdraw from the project.”

Amsterdam ",ABN AMRO threatens to stop financing company behind the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline,ABN AMRO ,Netherlands,Dakota Access Pipeline ,energy distribution | oil and gas,United States,"
ABN AMRO, the Dutch bank, today announced that it will end its financing for Energy Transfer Equity (ETE) if the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) will be constructed without the consent of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, or if further violence will be used. The Dutch Fair Finance Guide, Greenpeace Netherlands and BankTrack welcome the decision of ABN AMRO, and call on other banks, including ING in the Netherlands, to follow this example and end all outstanding finance to the pipeline and the companies behind it if no agreement is reached with the Sioux Tribe about the pipeline.


Peter Ras, project leader of the Dutch Fair Finance Guide, said: “ABN AMRO has already actively engaged with ETE on the ongoing violation of the rights of the Sioux tribe. It has now decided that the relation with ETE will be terminated if it does not fully respect the rights of the Sioux, or if further violence will be used against them. With this decision, ABN AMRO sets a fine example in taking its social responsibility, an example that ING and other banks need to follow!”


ETE is the parent company of Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), the majority owner of Dakota Access LLP, which is leading the pipeline construction. ABN AMRO is not taking part in the consortium of 17 banks, led by Citi and also including ING, that is directly financing the pipeline project. A large number of other banks, including –until now– ABN AMRO, have also provided credit facilities to the main companies behind the pipeline: ETE, ETP and Sunoco Logistics.


ABN AMRO provided a total of USD 45 million in credit to ETE. It has now decided: ""The bank has informed ETE of its strict adherence to FPIC principles and, accordingly, its desire that an acceptable non-violent solution be found among all parties impacted by the construction of the DAPL, including the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. If such a solution is not achieved, the ultimate consequence will be discontinuation of the relationship. In the meantime, ABN AMRO will not pursue any new business with ETE until there is clarity regarding the situation and an acceptable outcome has been achieved"". 


The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, supported by a wide range of groups worldwide, has protested already for months against the construction of the pipeline. The tribe fears that the construction of the pipeline will lead to pollution of their water sources and the destruction of sacred burial grounds. Private security services acting for the companies involved and the US National Guard have repeatedly used violence against the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and their supporters on the ground.


Construction of the pipeline was put on hold in December 2016 after a decision by the Obama administration to deny any permit until the completion of a new, detailed environmental assessment. The companies involved appealed against the obligation for a new environmental assessment, but this was rejected earlier this month. On January 24th, President Trump signed an executive order paving the way for the completion of the pipeline, followed by further pressure on the US army corps of engineers to grant the permit. No such permit has been issued so far.


Johan Frijns, director of BankTrack, commented: “The Dakota Access Pipeline is becoming a litmus test for all banks involved on how they weigh in the social, human rights and environmental impacts of their lending. IF ETE/ETP continues to violate the rights of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, and therefore the safeguard policies of banks involved, there is no other option left but to fully withdraw from the project. ING and all other banks involved would do well to draw the same conclusion as ABN AMRO.”


Kim Schoppink, campaign leader at Greenpeace said: ""ING told us last week that it had recently sold its shares in the companies behind the pipeline, worth USD 220 million. But ING continues to be part of the loan consortium for the pipeline and also continues to provide credit facilities to ETE and ETP. ING therefore remains co-responsible for the human rights violations and environmental impacts caused by the project"".

Amsterdam ",SMX Collective files complaint against Rabobank over drug money laundering and human rights violations in Mexico,Rabobank ,Netherlands,,,,"
SMX Collective, an initiative of the Dutch Foundation SMX: Dutch-Mexican Solidarity, assisted by the renowned law firm Prakken d’Oliveira, files a complaint against the Rabobank Group accusing the bank of laundering drug money and participating in a criminal organization. It concerns offenses committed at the local branch in Calexico, California, in the period December 2002 – Januari 2015. This complaint is the first of a series of activities promoted by SMX Collective to improve the human rights conditions in Mexico. 
The complaint is also filed on behalf of one of the family members of a victim of drugs violence in Mexico. The complaint exposes the relationship between the laundering of drug money by banks; and the murders, disappearances, torture and other crimes committed by drugs cartels in the North of Mexico. 
Gross neglect of anti-money laundering protocols
The Rabobank allegedly received enormous amounts of cash, which were transferred to other accounts as a way to disguise the criminal origins of the money. The complaint is directed against the Rabobank Group, as well as the managers of the bank. The Rabobank Group holds responsibility for its branches in the United States. 
Rabobank contributes to crimes against humanity in Mexico?
Rabobank is not the first bank to be accused of laundering drug money for Mexican cartels. However, this case marks the first time that the serious social and human rights consequences of money laundering for the Mexican civilian population are explicitly asked to be included in the criminal investigation. 
It is public knowledge that the laundering of drug money is a major problem in the border region of the United States and Mexico, and the Rabobank Group has been warned by US authorities on several occasions. Therefore, SMX Collective believes that the Rabobank Group has been insufficient in preventing money laundering and has seriously neglected its responsibility. Thus, the bank not only possibly played an important role in the laundering of drug money and thereby sustaining the drugs cartels; it has also possibly significantly contributed to the serious human rights violations being systematically perpetrated by Mexican drugs cartels. 
Launch of public campaign Money Laundering is not a Victimless Crime 
By filing the complaint at the Dutch Public Prosecutors office, SMX Collective launches the campaign Money Laundering is not a Victimless Crime which includes numerous actions to promote human rights in Mexico. The objective of the campaign is to call attention to the fact that drug money laundering is not a crime without victims. Furthermore, SMX Collective seeks justice for the victims by holding financial institutions and firms accountable for their criminal activities. Included you will find a summary of the complaint, background information on Mexico, as well as contact information for questions, comments and interviews. We appreciate your interest and are grateful for any help in spreading the information.
The full complaint is available on our campaign website and the website of Prakken d'Oliveira Human Rights Lawyers

Frankfurt ","Deutsche Bank puts first restrictions on coal finance, but still has long way to go",Deutsche Bank ,Germany,Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) ,energy plants - coal | energy plants - nuclear | mining - coal  | nuclear industry,South Korea,"
Today Deutsche Bank announced plans to reduce its exposure to thermal coal and its decision to no longer grant project financing for greenfield thermal coal mines and new coal-fired power stations. 
Heffa Schuecking, director of urgewald, one of Germany’s leading campaign organisations, said:
“This is a welcome and long overdue decision, but addresses only a small part of the problem. Direct project financing accounts for only 2% of banks’ financial flows to the global coal industry. 98% of the problem remains as the new guideline does not stop Deutsche Bank from providing corporate loans and investment banking services to companies with aggressive new build plans for coal-fired infrastructure.
“If Deutsche Bank really wants to bring its portfolio in line with the Paris Climate Agreement, it needs to blacklist clients like India’s NTPC, South Korea’s KEPCO and others who play a key role in driving forward projects that could catapult us into a 4°C world.”
Yann Louvel, Climate and Energy Campaign Coordinator at BankTrack, said:
“Deutsche Bank is now the eighth international bank to exclude direct financing of new coal mining projects and the sixth to exclude financing of new coal plant projects. Many of Deutsche Bank’s European competitors are, however, also beginning to exclude their corporate financing of companies which base over 50% of their revenues or power generation on coal. This sets a clear bar for what Deutsche Bank needs to do next.”

",RAN Statement on Continued Investment in Energy Transfer Equity,Credit Suisse ,Switzerland,Dakota Access Pipeline ,energy distribution | oil and gas,United States,"
Rainforest Action Network (RAN) has uncovered a critical funding deadline for Energy Transfer Equity, the parent company behind the Dakota Access Pipeline, and warns banks to steer clear of this dangerous and irresponsible company. The company is seeking a $2.2 billion refinancing loan, which is currently led by the Swiss bank Credit Suisse. Other big banks that want to be on this loan will need to commit by tomorrow, January 27, 2017.
“Banks should reject Energy Transfer Equity’s preliminary request for $2.2 billion of refinancing, given the company’s climate-wrecking business model and egregious human rights abuses at Standing Rock,” said Jason Opeña Disterhoft, Senior Campaigner. “Here’s an opportunity for banks to do the right thing. Stay away from this loan and steer clear of investing in Energy Transfer again.”
Energy Transfer Partners, Energy Transfer LNG, Sunoco Logistics Partners, and Sunoco are all companies in the Energy Transfer Family. The Energy Transfer Equity family owns and operates 71,000 miles of fossil fuel pipelines—meaning its growth is predicated on building new fossil fuel infrastructure that is in direct opposition to global consensus on climate change, the Paris Climate Agreement, and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). Its most notorious project, the Dakota Access Pipeline, violates the rights of the Standing Rock Sioux to self-determination and Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) regarding decisions on their traditional lands. The pipeline has spurred protests by the Standing Rock Sioux and others in North Dakota. Hundreds of thousands of citizens have responded to the Tribe’s request for solidarity and taken actions against Energy Transfer Partners and against the banks that have underwritten its finances.
Recent analysis has found that Energy Transfer Equity and Energy Transfer Partners are in financial distress, with revenue unable to keep up with growing debt loads. A sale of a stake in the Dakota Access Pipeline to Marathon Petroleum and Enbridge Energy Partners has been delayed along with the project itself; this is one example of delays that can affect cash flows in ways that ripple out to destabilize the company at large.
Just this week, Donald Trump signed an executive order in an attempt to push forward the Dakota Access Pipeline. The move ignores the climate impacts of this pipeline project, significant concerns raised by the Standing Rock Sioux about the grievous risk this pipeline poses to the Tribe’s drinking water supply, and the financially weak position of the parent company.

Jakarta, Indonesia ",APP’s New Pulp Mill Endangers Indonesia’s Climate Change Commitments, Development Bank ,China,OKI Pulp & Paper Mills ,forestry - pulp and paper,Indonesia,"
On December 23, 2016 Asia Pulp & Paper (APP) announced that it started production at one of the largest pulp and tissue mills in the world. In a joint statement released today, Wetlands International, Eyes on the Forest, Rainforest Action Network, Hutan Kita Institute, Woods & Wayside International, and Yayasan Auriga denounce the OKI mill in South Sumatra for its unacceptably high costs for Indonesia and the global environment. Read the statement.


The mill’s wood supply is grown mostly on drained peatlands, a production system that causes extremely high carbon emissions and, at times, catastrophic fires. The NGOs call on APP to present a plan to rewet and restore all of its plantations on drained peatlands. Until now, the company has not acknowledged that plantations on drained peatlands are unsustainable and should stop, despite overwhelming scientific evidence that supports this fact.

 

“APP needs to acknowledge the severity of the problem and stop draining peatlands to grow trees,” said Nyoman Suryadiputra, Indonesia Country Director for Wetlands International. “This starts with a commitment to phase out all drainage-based plantations on peatlands, and a credible plan to rewet and restore those areas,” he said.

 

An estimated three-quarters of the mill’s plantation concessions – at about 6,000 square kilometers (2,300 square miles), an area seven times the size of Singapore – are on peatlands, according to a detailed report published last April by 12 international and Indonesian NGOs.

 

When drained for the development of industrial plantations, peat becomes vulnerable to fires and releases very large amounts of carbon dioxide. Indonesia has prioritized peatlands restoration and conservation in its climate change commitments.

 

“With buyers increasingly concerned about their carbon footprints, sourcing paper from unsustainable peatland plantations – with an emissions profile tens of times larger than any other paper on the market -- just doesn’t make sense,” said Lafcadio Cortesi, with the Rainforest Action Network.

 

The development of peatlands for industrial forestry and agriculture, including the supply base of the OKI mill, was a major cause of Indonesia’s catastrophic fires in 2015, which exposed 43 million people to thick haze and resulted in $16 billion of economic losses for Indonesia.

 

The OKI mill is financed by $2.5 billion in loans from Chinese state-owned financial institutions. The Government of Indonesia has given the OKI mill a ten-year corporate tax holiday.

",Odebrecht corruption in Dominican Republic – Five European banks urged to pull out of dirty coal plant financing ,Banco Santander ,Spain,Punta Catalina-Hatillo coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Dominican Republic,"
European banks must now pull out of financing the $2 billion Punta Catalina coal plant project following recent confirmation of Brazilian company Odebrecht’s widespread use of bribery to secure construction contracts in Dominican Republic, according to NGOs which have been campaigning to stop the controversial project in the Caribbean country.
On December 22, 2016, Odebrecht's long-suspected corruption activities were confirmed in a US court action where, as part of a plea bargain, the company admitted to paying officials to help secure lucrative construction contracts in 12 countries, including Dominican Republic.  An investigation into Odebrecht corruption in Dominican Republic has been set up to consider the $92 million in bribes which the company admits to having paid intermediaries and Dominican officials for contracts between 2001 and 2014. 


Deutsche Bank, ING, Santander, Société Générale and UniCredit have to date disbursed approximately $320 million out of a planned total loan amount of $632.5 million for the Punta Catalina coal plant. Odebrecht was awarded the Punta Catalina construction contract in dubious circumstances, which campaigners set out in correspondence to the European financiers in April 2016.

Enrique de León, of Dominican group National Committee to Combat Climate Change, said: 


“Following our warnings last year, the banks recognised that there were allegations of corrupt practices in connection with the tendering process, but were prepared to give Odebrecht and the Punta Catalina project the benefit of the doubt. Odebrecht’s confessions in a US law court have now put beyond any doubt the extent to which corruption has been central to its business for more than a decade, with Dominican Republic proving to be one of its bribery hotspots. Responsible investors need to take a zero tolerance approach to corrupt companies and projects, and these big European banks must surely now end their involvement in Punta Catalina.”


In the wake of Odebrecht’s corruption admissions the National Committee against Climate Change has called on the Dominican state's purchasing and procurement agency to cancel the company’s contract for Punta Catalina and permanently disqualify it as a state contractor. 


The fallout from the Odebrecht scandal continues to reverberate in Dominican Republic. A mass civil society demonstration and ‘March against Impunity’ is planned to take place on Sunday(January 22) in Dominican Republic’s capital Santa Domingo.

Yann Louvel, Climate and Energy Campaign coordinator at BankTrack, commented: 


“Deutsche Bank, ING, Santander, Société Générale and UniCredit have to recognise they took a big bet on a very dodgy coal plant and now accept the inevitable: they cannot condone corruption in one of their investments. Coal plant investments in far away parts of the world not only jeopardise the climate but are also jeopardising the credibility of the banks’ due diligence procedures. They would do well now to call a halt to all coal power financing for good.”   
Notes for editors:


1. ‘Odebrecht bribed across Latin America’, Deutsche Welle, December 23, 2016.


2. The National Committee to Combat Climate Change’s appeal to the General Directorate of Public Contracts is based on Dominican Republic's Law 340-06, which holds that if procurement-related bribes are confirmed then bidding processes must be cancelled and any executed contracts are to be terminated. The same law also requires the disqualification of companies which have performed bribes, which have committed this offence in other cases or which have executives with convictions for corruption.


The proposed Punta Catalina project, a BankTrack 'dodgy deal', comprises two identical coal-fired units each with 385 megawatt capacity, and the construction of a coal terminal with a capacity of 80,000 tonnes. Project finance for the coal plant was agreed with Société Générale, Deutsche Bank, ING, Santander, UniCredit in summer 2015, alongside a loan guarantee from SACE, Italy’s export credit agency. Background information about the Punta Catalina project is available at the BankTrack website.

",Dirty Bankers: How HSBC is financing forest destruction for palm oil,HSBC ,United Kingdom,Bumitama ,agriculture - palm oil ,Indonesia,"
HSBC, headquartered in the UK, is currently one of the largest providers of financial services to the palm oil industry. HSBC has detailed policies on forestry and agricultural commodities (including specific sections on palm oil). It claims these policies 'prohibit the finance of deforestation', but a new Greenpeace report shows many of the companies it funds are destroying forests.
Since 2012, HSBC has been involved in arranging loans and other credit facilities totalling USD 16.3bn for the six companies profiled in Greenpeace's Dirty Bankers report, as well as nearly USD 2bn in corporate bonds. In some cases, details of contributions made by each lender (including HSBC) are accessible, but for many deals this information is not available.
As these case studies show, not only are HSBC's policies inadequate, but it is providing services to companies that breach them. Its links to some of the most damaging companies in the sector leave HSBC exposed to serious reputational risk, in addition to the financial risks associated with the palm oil industry.
Evidence that these companies were responsible for unacceptable activities is in the public domain: they have been subject to Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) complaints or suspension, been cited by the Indonesian government for unrestrained fires and/or been the subject of numerous critical reports from social and environmental non-governmental organisations (NGOs).
Even the most basic due diligence on these companies should have set alarm bells ringing, which raises the question: is HSBC failing to apply its policies altogether, or just failing to apply sufficient scrutiny when assessing whether current or prospective customers comply?

Standing Rock, ND ",10 Banks financing Dakota Access Pipeline decline meeting with tribal leaders,,,Dakota Access Pipeline ,energy distribution | oil and gas,United States,"
For the last six weeks, a global coalition has been pressuring banks providing project loans to the Dakota Access Pipeline to renegotiate or cancel their loans. In December, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and other Indigenous leaders requested that each of these banks meet with tribal representatives to hear their concerns.
The deadline for banks to respond to the Tribe’s meeting request was January 10, and as of this statement:

Four banks have declined: BayernLB, BNP Paribas, Mizuho Bank, and Suntrust
Six banks have not responded at all: Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, BBVA Compass, ICBC, Intesa Sanpaolo, Natixis, and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation
Seven banks have met or agreed to meet with the Tribe and its allies: Citi, Crédit Agricole, DNB, ING, Société Générale, TD, and Wells Fargo

In response, organizers are escalating their pressure on banks that refuse to engage. The Indigenous coalition at Standing Rock has a running billboard in Times Square asking millions of people to #DefundDAPL. Organizers continue a drumbeat of protests and bank occupations, along with brand-damaging campaigns that have already led to the closure of thousands of accounts worth a self-reported $46,314,727.18.
Protests have increased in fervor and frequency over the last few weeks, including multiple occupations of Wells Fargo, US Bank and Citibank branches, as well as a daring banner drop during a nationally televised Vikings/Bears NFL game at US Bank Stadium in protest of their bankrolling of DAPL project sponsors Sunoco Logistics and Energy Transfer Partners.
Backed by hundreds of thousands of online signatures and commitments to #DefundDAPL, organizers from more than 25 grassroots groups vowed the campaign will continue and intensify in the coming weeks, building up to a planned “global week of action” unless all 17 of the banks act. The ask for the banks is to discontinue loan disbursements in consultation with Native leaders until outstanding issues are resolved, and Free, Prior and Informed Consent from Indigenous peoples is upheld.
Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault II said: “We are pleased that some of the banks behind DAPL are willing to engage Standing Rock Sioux leadership, but maintain that all 17 should not be helping a company who deliberately ignores our concerns. We call on the remaining banks to agree to a meeting with the Tribe. We know that they have heard Energy Transfer Partners’ side of the story, and they need to hear our perspective as well.”
Ladonna Bravebull Allard, Sacred Stone Camp said: “I want the banks to know that the power of their investment comes from the people, and the people are saying we have the right to water, and we will stand for the water. Stop investing in destruction of the earth.”
Tara Houska, National Campaigns Director, Honor the Earth said: “This movement has shown again and again that the power and strength of the people is incredible. Banks need our dollars to make their investments. We can and must hold these financial backers accountable for supporting destruction of our shared planet and futures. Move past dated fuels and justly transition to a green economy.”
Eryn Wise, International Indigenous Youth Council said: “What began as a protection of the earth has now become a reclamation of power. We are demanding that our interests as a prospering people be put before banks and their investments. We hold in our hands the ability to encourage divestment to the point of fruition and we will not back down.”
Dallas Goldtooth, Keep it in the Ground Organizer, Indigenous Environmental Network said: “As a movement to stop this dirty Bakken oil pipeline, we are demonstrating the inherent power of organized communities and mobilized citizens. We are showing Big Oil and government leaders that we know the power of our capital, and as such we collectively choose to invest in life and water, not death and oil. As first peoples of the land and in defense of our Indigenous rights, we will continue to rise, resist, self-determine and divest until the Dakota Access pipeline is nothing but the defeated aspirations of a Energy Transfer Partners’ dream.”
Judith LeBlanc, Director, Native Organizers Alliance said: “The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has a spiritual obligation to protect the Missouri River for all. The best way for the banks to meet their obligation to protect their investor’s interest is to meet with the Tribal leadership. Mother Earth and all of our ancestors deserve the opportunity for an exchange on our shared moral obligations to protect Mother Earth for generations to come.”
Sara Nelson, Executive Director, Romero Institute and the Lakota People’s Law Project said: “We are moving our financial accounts from Wells Fargo to a local bank that does not invest in companies who violate Indigenous rights and environmental impact requirements, and will not endanger clean water for millions of people. We want our money used to support positive solutions for our children’s future, not to float big companies who send oil overseas, make the American people pay for inevitable spills, and generate profits for banks and billion dollar global companies.”
Leila Salazar López, Executive Director, Amazon Watch said: “From Standing Rock to the Amazon, Indigenous peoples are defending their territories and providing a model for a fossil free world. It’s time banks listen to Indigenous peoples and their allies in our call to Keep It In The Ground.”
Lindsey Allen, Executive Director, Rainforest Action Network said: “Investing in a project of Energy Transfer Partners, a company that has abused Indigenous and human rights, was a big mistake. These banks now have a chance to fix it by meeting with the Standing Rock Sioux, and upholding Free, Prior and Informed Consent from Indigenous peoples.”
Dr. Gabriela Lemus, President of Progressive Congress Action Fund said: “No bank should support poisoning communities’ land and water- yet too many banks still have investments in Energy Transfer Partners and the Dakota Access Pipeline. We call on these banks to divest completely. Families’ lives are at risk, and that should always take priority over profits. All banks have a responsibility not only to their shareholders and customers, but to the communities that are impacted by their investments. Don’t keep funding this dangerous project.”
Todd Larsen, Executive Co-Director of Green America said: “Banks need to end investments that harm the rights and lives of Indigenous peoples. We call on all banks to divest entirely from the Dakota Access Pipeline. Until these banks do so, all Americans should divest their money from any bank providing financing to this ruinous pipeline.”
Erich Pica, President, Friends of the Earth U.S. said: “The voices of Indigenous peoples have been ignored for too long – by the US government, corporations and big banks. By not acknowledging Indigenous peoples, or outright refusing to meet with them, these ten banks are perpetuating a pattern of colonialism and failing to respect Indigenous peoples’ rights to Free, Prior and Informed Consent.”
Johan Frijns, Director of BankTrack said: “The Dakota Access Pipeline project is supposed to be in compliance with the Equator Principles, and therefore guarantee Indigenous peoples’ rights to be properly consulted. The refusal of leading EP banks to meet with the Sioux Tribe not only makes a complete mockery of that commitment, but also poses a severe risk to the very credibility of the Equator Principles.”
Vanessa Green, Director of DivestInvest Individual said: “DAPL is simply the wrong kind of investment, and people don’t want their money behind it. With government mandates to scale up clean energy investments, a market increasingly supportive of a low carbon future, and unprecedented consumer and investor interest in moving money into climate and community solutions, the question now is which banks will lose the most in this historic energy transition.”
Mary Sweeters, Arctic Campaigner with Greenpeace USA, said: “People across the world have pledged their solidarity with the Indigenous communities who reject this dirty pipeline and the threat it poses to the water and climate. The banks must choose whether they want to continue to invest their money in yesterday or listen to the millions of people who stand with Standing Rock.”

Paris ","Coal in Indonesia: Société Générale pulls out of financing, Crédit Agricole under pressure to follow",BNP Paribas ,France,Cirebon 2 coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Indonesia,"
In a move welcomed by Friends of the Earth France, Société Générale has confirmed that it will not finance the Tanjung Jati B 2 (TJB2) coal plant project in Indonesia. It has become the second French bank to withdraw from the controversial TJB2 project, which would heavily impact the climate and the health of Indonesians, following a decision from BNP Paribas in 2015. Friends of the Earth France is now calling on Crédit Agricole to also withdraw from TJB2 financing as well as from the Cirebon 2 coal plant project in Indonesia to help prevent potential impacts at both projects and to ensure that the bank respects the commitment it made only in October last year to end its financing of all new coal-fired power plant projects around the world.
Société Générale’s commitment in October 2016 to no longer finance new coal-fired power plant projects entered into force on 1st January this year, thus the bank is no longer able to finance the TJB2 project in Indonesia.  The project, which would be incompatible with a 2°C climate pathway, and which one study has suggested may lead to the premature deaths of 1200 people , failed to reach financial closure before the beginning of 2017 in order to guarantee the participation of Société Générale, one of six banks – including Crédit Agricole – which have been considering finance for the project.
Lucie Pinson, Private finance campaigner for Friends of the Earth France, commented:
""Following pressure for its involvement in an array of coal projects after the adoption of the Paris Agreement, Société Générale committed in October 2016 to end its financing for all new coal-fired power plant projects all around the world. However, as it wanted to spare its relations with its clients who are promoting the Tanjung Jati B 2 project, the bank had given them until December 2016 to complete the financing. As the project is enduring further delays, Société Générale is now obliged to disassociate itself from the group of funders in order to respect its commitment from October.""
Friends of the Earth France learned in January 2016 from an article published in the financial press that Société Générale and Crédit Agricole had joined the group of funders to the TJB2 project following the withdrawal of BNP Paribas. Also reported a few months later was the involvement of Crédit Agricole in a second coal-fired power plant project in Indonesia, Cirebon 2, which is proving to be even more controversial than TJB2 and is currently facing legal challenges. 
Lucie Pinson continued:
""Unlike the other French banks, Crédit Agricole is still involved in not one but two new coal power plant projects in Indonesia. To end up as the last French bank directly financing new coal-fired power plants would be an extremely bad legacy, and we call on Crédit Agricole to withdraw immediately from both Tanjung Jati B 2 and Cirebon 2. In October 2016, the bank committed, just the same as Société Générale, to no longer fund new coal-fired power plant projects anywhere in the world. As new year’s resolutions are still fresh in the air, it’s crucial that Crédit Agricole still respects the promises it made in 2016.""
At the end of December, Crédit Agricole published a new policy on coal-fired power plants which enacted the October commitment not to finance new power plants and also outlined that it would no longer support companies which generate more than 50% of their electricity from coal. Friends of the Earth has analysed this policy and also published a study on the compliance of Cirebon 2 with Crédit Agricole’s social and environmental commitments. The conclusion of the analysis: if the new policy is weak and insufficient to meet the climate targets, financing Cirebon 2 would be a clear violation of the Equator Principles of which the bank is a signatory .

Brussels ","Garanti, Turkey’s top climate killer bank, praised as climate champion",Garanti BBVA ,Turkey,,,,"
Turkey's second largest private bank, Garanti, which finances the country’s coal boom, received the 2016 Climate Performance Leadership award from CDP, a UK-based organisation, earlier this month. Environmental groups shed light on the destructive impacts of the dodgy deals the bank is involved in, in order to counter its green claims deceiving the European public.


Garanti Bank, over the last 10 years, provided financial support to more than 6 GW of coal power, which contribute millions of tons of CO2 to the pace gaining global warming and which are firmly opposed by local communities. Garanti has been directly involved in financing six coal power plant projects, and has provided significant financial support to the privatization of four existing coal power plants. This resulted in extending their lifetime due to the privatization process at their respective age of retirement.


Despite the bank’s involvement in Turkey's coal rush, with currently 80 new coal power plants in the pipeline, earlier this month UK-based CDP (former Carbon Disclosure Project) included Garanti Bank in its ‘Global Climate A List' which is used as basis for the STOXX Global Climate Change Leaders Index. However, this is based only on the bank’s own responses to CDP’s questionnaire and  overlooks information on the share of coal in the bank’s portfolio.


Elif Gündüzyeli, Climate Action Network Europe, Turkey Climate and Energy Policy Coordinator, said: “Garanti’s green claims deceive the European public into believing that the bank takes climate change into account in its investment decisions. Behind a smokescreen of committing to introduce shadow carbon pricing, ask clients to plant trees and reduce emissions in office buildings, the bank hides destruction of the climate and people’s livelihoods.”


Cansın Leylim Ilgaz, 350.org Turkey Campaigner, said: “For decades, peoples of Turkey have been resisting coal power plants that harm their health, environment and livelihoods. Just last May, people demonstrated their resistance to Garanti financed Izdemir coal power plant in Aliağa region. Banks like Garanti are financing fossil fuels, using our money to drive agricultural, environmental destruction while driving irreversible climate change that affects the whole planet. There is no real climate leadership without divesting from fossil fuels.”


Yann Louvel, Climate and Energy Campaign Coordinator at Banktrack, said: ""Garanti told us last year that they were ‘in line’ with the vision of our ‘Paris Pledge’, which was a commitment to phase out financing for the coal sector. Yet there is no mention of ‘coal’ in their answer to the CDP, and the bank has not adopted a single measure to reduce coal financing, unlike many of its European or American peers. It's outright  ridiculous to present Garanti as a global leader on climate in the CDP ranking.""


Aytaç Tolga Timur, Yeryüzü Derneği (Earth Association) highlighted the impacts of coal finance on the ground and said, “It is surprising to see Garanti Bank on CDP’s Global A list. Garanti Bank may have disclosed some sustainability data, but this does not mean that they are on track towards a  low carbon future. Garanti financed the privatization of Seyitömer coal power plant, where we have observed serious human rights violations on ground. Seyitömer is one of the dirtiest and oldest coal plants in Europe. It is still operating thanks to privatization support.”

Nijmegen, the Netherlands ",Top US and UK banks urged not to help bankroll destructive Rampal coal plant in Bangladesh,Bank of America ,United States,Rampal coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Bangladesh,"
Five top international banks, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Standard Chartered, have today been urged by 53 groups from around the world to distance themselves from forthcoming bond issues for the Export-Import Bank of India (India Exim).
The groups have notified the banks that they would consider any engagement in underwriting or lead manager activities on behalf of India Exim as enabling the realisation of the Rampal coal-fired power plant in Bangladesh, unless India Exim pulls out of financing for the highly controversial, $1.6 billion project. 
The open letter, addressed to the CEOs of the five banks, emphasises a UNESCO report recommendation published in October that the Rampal project should be “cancelled and relocated” in order to avoid irreversible damage to the Sundarbans mangrove forest, parts of which are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Standard Chartered have performed underwriting and ‘lead manager’ services in previous bond issuances from India Exim, a state-owned export credit agency. The bank, which has yet to reach financial close on loan support to the Rampal project, has made one bond issuance already in 2016 with another one potentially to come before the end of the year.
Johan Frijns, director of BankTrack, said:
“UNESCO’s ‘cancel and relocate’ Rampal recommendation to the Bangladeshi state authorities was unequivocal and stands as a stark reputation warning to any responsible investors tempted to involve themselves in the raising of funds for India Exim.
“Western private banks have correctly chosen not to implicate themselves in the appalling and unnecessary Rampal project via direct financing. Groups from India, Bangladesh and from around the world now call on Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Standard Chartered not to put slim profits from India Exim bond arranging ahead of the priceless Sundarbans forest and the two million Bangladeshis whose livelihoods depend on its survival.”
Resistance to the proposed Rampal project is widening in Bangladesh. At the end of November, a peaceful mass rally of 15,000 demonstrators calling for the project’s cancellation gathered in the capital Dhaka, with groups from across Bangladeshi civil society planning further mass protests throughout the country in the new year.   
The appropriateness of the Rampal project has also been questioned by a recent report, from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, which maps out a cheaper, cleaner and faster-to-implement alternative electricity plan for Bangladesh based on the country’s huge energy efficiency and solar energy potential.   
Notes for editors: 
1. See the open letter, signed by 53 groups including 350.org, Avaaz, Greenpeace India, Friends of the Earth International and Waterkeeper Alliance.
2. See the UNESCO monitoring mission report recommendations.
UNESCO’s concerns about Rampal and its impacts, based on a monitoring mission to the area earlier this year, are underscored by its further recommendation that the Sundarbans should be considered next year for inclusion on the World Heritage in Danger list if the Bangladesh government decides to proceed with the coal plant.

Concerning: Halt your support to the Dakota Access Pipeline
November 30th 2016
Dear Sirs,
The undersigned organizations are writing to you to share our deep concern about your participation in a credit agreement led by Citibank with Dakota Access LLC and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company LLC, to borrow up to $2.5 billion to construct the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) and the Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline in the United States.
As you are aware, the proposed 1,172 mile-long DAPL is the subject of a huge international outcry, led by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, but supported by the tribal governments of over 280 other tribes and allies from all over the world. This growing global resistance opposes DAPL because the pipeline trajectory is cutting through Native American sacred territories and unceded Treaty lands, and because it threatens air and water resources in the region and further downstream.
Since last April, an ever growing number of Native water protectors and their thousands of allies have converged peacefully at Standing Rock in the pipeline construction area to halt further construction of the project. In response to this strictly-peaceful, on-site resistance, police from multiple U.S. states and agencies, members of the U.S. National Guard, and armed private security forces working for project sponsors have used military equipment, tactics and weapons to intimidate, assault, arrest and otherwise commit grievous human rights violations against water protectors and their allies. Indiscriminate use of attack dogs, rubber bullets, concussion grenades, tazers and mace are reported, while journalists covering the assault have been arrested. The violence unleashed on the protesters by security forces has already left hundreds severely injured. Last week, protesters were attacked with water cannons used in sub-zero temperatures, leading to life threatening situations. One protester faces a possible amputation of her arm after being hit with a concussion grenade. Protesters that have been arrested have also been subjected to inhumane treatment that involved, among other things, being locked up naked, or cramped without food and warmth into dog kennels.
As the loan syndicate is led by four banks that are signatory to the Equator Principles, this project loan is subject to these Principles. Given that Indigenous rights commitments are presumed to be respected by the Principles, specifically the right of indigenous communities to withhold consent to projects affecting their ancestral lands (FPIC), it is for us inexplicable that the clear and long standing opposition to the project by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, as well as widely documented gross violations of Native land titles, threats to water sources and the desecration of burial grounds have not been identified early on as reasons for participating banks to not provide funding for this project. Harm to Native areas has now already occurred when DAPL personnel deliberately desecrated documented burial grounds and other culturally important sites. Native American opponents to the project have emphasized throughout that the DAPL struggle is about larger Native liberation, self-determination and survival at the hands of colonial corporations and compliant government actors.
The undersigned organizations are closely watching how the banks providing financial support to the project are acting on the ever worsening situation on the ground, including your bank.Given your stated commitment to respect indigenous rights and the contrast with the harsh reality on the ground we demand that:

all further loan disbursements to the project are immediately put on hold;
banks involved in the loan demand from the project sponsor that all construction of the pipeline and all associated structures is put on hold until all outstanding issues are resolved to the full satisfaction of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe;
in case such a resolution of outstanding issues is not achieved with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, your bank fully withdraws from the loan agreement;
a public statement is made by your bank on how you will act on the issues identified above.

We all stand with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in defending their ancestral lands from the impact of this project and are fully prepared to take further campaign steps in case we consider your response on this call unsatisfactory. Given the urgency of the matter we seek a response from you on this letter as soon as possible, but no later than December 5.
Sincerely,
BankTrack, Netherlands - Johan Frijns, Director

Amsterdam ",Dutch banks spend millions on lobbying,ABN AMRO ,Netherlands,,,,"
Powerful lobby
“The powerful lobby by Dutch banks is not very visible in the Netherlands and in the EU, where most financial laws are made. Banks have a very strong influence, at the expanse of public interests”, says researcher Myriam Vander Stichele. “For ordinary citizens, it is close to impossible to find  out how to influence the legislative process regarding financial laws.”
The SOMO study describes in detail how lobby is organised within the six Dutch banks, and how transparent they are about their lobby activities. The major banks ING, ABN AMRO and Rabobank can make their voices better heard at the Ministry of Finance than the smaller banks, Triodos Bank, SNS Bank and ASN Bank.
Example: ING Bank
“ING has the biggest lobby capacity, with an in-house lobby unit of 17 employees. Furthermore, the bank is a member of 38 financial lobby organisations, and spends at least € 400,000 on representation in Brussels with European institutions. They also spent approximately three million euros on their membership of the NVB”, says Vander Stichele. “Because lobby is unbalanced and not transparent, the government risks overhearing public voices, a situation which is regarded as one of the causes of the financial crisis in 2008.”
Last Thursday, the Dutch government responded to Lobby in Daylight by Labour MPs Lea Bouwmeester and Astrid Oosenbrug. The Minister’s response is very meagre and not very concrete: “Lobbying by large banks is a social and structural problem. We think that binding measures are needed to increase transparency, and to ensure that different voices are heard in new legislation”, concludes Vander Stichele.

The undersigned civil society organizations (CSOs) from around the world, BankTrack included, call on the Dutch development bank (FMO) to adopt measures in its Sustainability Policy to prevent and address reprisals against human rights defenders (HRDs) related to the activities it finances.
The need for FMO to strengthen protection for HRDs was poignantly made clear by the murder of Berta Cáceres in March 2016, who for years protested the Agua Zarca hydroelectric project in Honduras, financed by FMO. The Dutch government has prioritized HRDs, recognizing that they are “key driving forces behind change and progress in their countries” and that the international system provides them insufficient protection. As a national development bank, FMO has an obligation under international law to respect and protect the rights of those affected by the activities it finances, including those who raise their voices in dissent. 
In addition, FMO has committed to uphold the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which requires that it and its clients respect internationally recognized human rights in their operations. The best way to protect HRDs is by ensuring that the projects FMO finances have no adverse human rights impacts in the first place. The UN Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders called upon development finance institutions to “integrate a human rights-based approach in their policies  condition their funds on such an approach, in consultation with… human rights defenders.” However, in the event that impacts occur, FMO and its clients must be prepared to ensure the safety of HRDs who raise concerns.
In order for FMO to meet its human rights obligations, FMO’s draft Sustainability Policy should be revised to include: 

A zero-tolerance approach to the killings of and violent acts, threats and intimidation against human rights defenders, as they are defined by the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders.

To implement this commitment, FMO should:

Assess the investment context to determine if the freedoms of expression, assembly, and association are sufficiently ensured such that FMO’s policies can be implemented adequately by its client
Require its client to identify potential human rights impacts that the project may cause, contribute to, or exacerbate—in addition to or expressly incorporated within the assessment required by the International Finance Corporation’s Performance Standards, and to work with clients to fully address any potentially adverse human rights impacts
Identify and publicly disclose measures FMO and its client will take to prevent and mitigate the risks found by the assessments, including specific actions needed to protect human rights defenders
Include in its agreements with its clients clauses requiring them to take all reasonable measures to prevent, investigate and respond to reprisals, failure for which should result in withdrawal and full repayment of investments
Develop and institutionalize creative methods to enable people, including marginalized and discriminated against groups, to freely participate in consultations regarding FMO-financed activities and give or withhold their consent, as appropriate, without risk of reprisals
Develop a rigorous process for monitoring for threats to or other reprisals against people who express their views about FMO-financed projects
Develop an urgent response system to address threats to HRDs who criticize FMO-financed activities and implement—with the consent of the HRDs—protection measures, including communication with local authorities, coordination with Dutch embassies and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and/or speaking out publicly in defense of HRDs
Ensure that those communities likely to be affected by a project are aware of and feel safe in approaching FMO’s Independent Complaints Mechanism (ICM) and empower the ICM to examine any instances of retaliation for opposition to the project and/or participation in the mechanism process.

Marrakech, Morocco  ",Financing of coal industry expansion by top banks undermining Paris Agreement ,ANZ ,Australia,Cirebon 2 coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Indonesia,"
The failing efforts of the world’s top commercial banks to restrict their coal financing are undermining the Paris Agreement’s aim of limiting the global temperature increase to 1.5°C, according to a report published today by a coalition of coal finance campaign groups. 
One year on from the Paris climate summit, 'Still Coughing up for Coal: Big Banks after the Paris Agreement' identifies the alarming policy gaps and lack of climate ambition prevailing at 22 major Australian, European and U.S. banks. Due to the scant policy coverage which banks are applying to their oil and gas portfolios, where financing is booming , the new report focuses solely on the coal finance restrictions which are being slowly introduced at the banks.
Based on the report’s findings, its authors BankTrack, Friends of the Earth France, Market Forces, Rainforest Action Network and urgewald are calling on banks to stop all financing which would expand the coal industry and also reduce their exposure to coal companies to zero by 2020, to ensure a managed decline of existing coal infrastructure.
Amanda Starbuck, Climate and Energy Program Director at Rainforest Action Network, said: 
""The banking industry still has far to go if it is to meet the ambition of the Paris climate accord to keep warming below a target of 1.5 degrees. Simply put, there is no room for coal in a climate-stable world. Banks need to improve their policies by setting clear and aggressive timelines for exiting the coal mining and coal power sectors.""
'Still Coughing up for Coal' also describes numerous, ongoing coal 'dodgy deals' which have been facilitated by banks in the course of the last year since COP21 in Paris.
Lucie Pinson, Private Finance Campaigner at Friends of the Earth France, said: 
""Even those banks which have moved ahead of the pack in policy terms, such as Crédit Agricole and Société Générale, are still having their heads turned by highly controversial coal power projects such as Cirebon 2 and TJB2 in Indonesia. The two French banks recently committed to end project finance for all new coal plants around the world but neither has yet seen fit to pull out of financing for these two projects. The double standard of making new climate commitments and yet continuing with coal finance business as usual is breathtaking. If Société Générale and Crédit Agricole bankroll Cirebon 2 and TJB2, they are inviting major reputational risk."" 
Yann Louvel, Climate and Energy Campaign Coordinator at BankTrack, said: 
""Many of the top banks have clearly rested on their laurels since unveiling new coal finance restrictions in the run up to last year’s COP21. However, with the Paris Agreement now in force, the climate reality is biting and the banks have to wake up and immediately stop financing the expansion of the coal industry. Phasing out of coal has to be the top priority for any self-styled ‘climate champion’ bank, alongside tackling their largely unfettered multi-billion dollar support for oil and gas.""

Nijmegen ","Announcing our new, fully redesigned website",,,,,,"
Today we’re very proud to announce the launch of the fully redesigned BankTrack website. The new site gives a fresh presentation to our profiles of over a hundred banks and the Dodgy Deals they are financing, as well as news, blogs and campaign resources. The new design is focused on making the site easier to use, sleeker and faster to navigate.


The redesign follows BankTrack’s reorganization at the start of 2015, from a network of civil society groups to an independent campaigning organization in its own right.

 

As before, the core of the website is its database of over 170 “Dodgy Deal” profiles and some 150 bank profiles, with each deal linked to the profiles of the banks financing it. These fully redesigned profiles include deals and companies that are the subject of active NGO campaigns, including the Dakota Access Pipeline in the United States, the proposed Rampal coal plant in Bangladesh and Australia’s offshore detention centres, as well as deals going back to BankTrack’s beginnings over 12 years ago, kept on the bank’s record for posterity. The website also acts as a platform for other campaigners, featuring news and reports from civil society organisations targeting banks. 


Some of the main changes we have made with the new website are:

More informative profile front pages. The previous tab structure for profiles has been redesigned, so our new profiles have all the most important information on the front page.
New world map of all dodgy deals. The world map page allows filtering for projects and companies, and filtering by bank and sector.
Clear overview of which banks are financing which dodgy deals. The finance section has been redesigned to quickly show which banks are linked to which dodgy deals, with the possibility to expand and collapse details about each bank’s involvement.
One search bar for news, profiles and everything else. Rather than four separate search bars for banks, companies, campaigns and deals, the new website has one straight-forward search bar to help you find anything on the site.


Image: Navigating to and around a Dodgy Deal profile on the new webiste
We will continue to add new features in the coming weeks to make the site even more user friendly and provide more detail to the profiles that we feature.


Take a look at the new website at www.banktrack.org.


We very much appreciate feedback and comments on the new site - contact raymon@banktrack.org.

Nijmegen ",An open letter to the Equator Principles Association,,,Dakota Access Pipeline ,energy distribution | oil and gas,United States,"
To:  Mr. Nigel Beck, Standard Bank, Chair of the Equator Principles Association, All Equator Principles Financial institutions (EPFIs)
Concerning:  Equator Principles climate commitments, and EPFI financing of the Dakota Access Pipeline, for discussion at your Annual Meeting and Workshop in London
 
Dear Mr. Beck,
The undersigned organizations are writing to you, as Chair of the Equator Principles Association, to urge the Association at its upcoming Annual Meeting in London to address two distinct and important issues:

Equator Principles Financial Institutions (EPFIs) must take long overdue, concrete steps to strengthen their climate commitments.
Our deep concern about the involvement of a substantial number of EPFIs in the financing of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL).

Strong climate change commitments from EPFIs needed

As you will be aware, your Annual Meeting coincides with the start of the Marrakech Climate Summit, where governments will seek ways to implement the Paris Climate Agreement that came into effect on November 4. As is already clear, commitments made thus far by state parties to the agreement will not keep average global temperature rise below the agreed 2 degree Celsius threshold, let alone the desired 1.5 degree target. To achieve this, much more needs to be done, urgently, by state and non-state parties alike.
The Equator Principles (EPs), being the prime sustainability initiative of 85 of the world’s leading banks, could play an important role in strengthening the climate commitments of adopting banks. This would also be in the best interest of those banks, given that the EPs are meant to be an ‘enhanced risk management framework for determining, assessing and managing environmental and social risk’, presumably with ‘climate change’ included as a major risk.
Given the magnitude of the current climate crisis one would expect that the EPs demand a high level of climate due diligence to be conducted, not only to assess the potential impact of climate change on projects under consideration, but also – and more importantly – to assess how these projects will contribute to, or may jeopardize, reaching the globally agreed climate targets of the Paris Agreement.
It would then be imperative that such identified risks are avoided wherever possible. This would require the mandatory choice of the least Greenhouse Gas (GHG) intensive alternative for all proposed projects, but also the withholding of finance for all projects and business activities that pose an unacceptably large climate risk. Such stringent due diligence and selection procedures, combined with the a priori categorical exclusion of all projects that by their very nature strongly contribute to climate change (most notably all fossil fuel extraction and transportation infrastructure, and all fossil fuel based energy generation projects) must then necessarily result in major shifts in the overall portfolio of EPFIs.
However, the reality today is very different. It took over a decade for the word ‘climate’ to even appear in the text of the EPs. But the current, 2014 version of the EPs (EPIII), in which the word finally appears, still seems to be in near-complete denial on the severity of the climate crisis, as it places almost no meaningful climate conditionality on prospective clients and projects.
Meanwhile, EPFIs have continued to enthusiastically finance new coal mines and coal power plants, oil exploration projects and pipelines, gas fracking projects and LNG terminals all over the world. The fact that all these climate destroying projects are stamped with an ‘Equator Compliant’ seal of approval not only provides project sponsors with a wholly undeserved claim to sustainability, but it also makes a complete mockery of the pretention of the EPFIs to adequately manage social and environmental risk that impact on their business.
Change in the climate approach of the EPs is urgently needed and long overdue. We urgently call upon your Association to use this Annual Meeting to start strengthening your collective climate commitments, by including stringent and binding climate criteria for all projects to be considered under the EP framework, and by categorically excluding all energy projects with an unacceptably large impact on climate change, starting with all coal power plants.
Fortunately, the urgency of this matter is not lost on some of your members; over the last two years a number of EPFIs have adopted climate and energy policies that move way beyond the EPs. It is time for the EP Association as a whole to side with the leaders in your group and move ahead, rather than be content with the EPs merely reflecting the lowest common denominator.
Equator bank funds for the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL)

Our organizations have been astonished to learn that no less than 13 EPFIs are involved in a credit agreement with Dakota Access LLC and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company LLC, to borrow up to $2.5 billion to construct the Dakota Access Pipeline and the Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline in the United States. An additional 8 EPFIs are providing further credit to the project sponsors.
As you are aware, the proposed 1,172 mile-long DAPL is the subject of huge international outcry, led by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, but supported by the tribal governments of over 280 other tribes and allies from all over the world. This growing global resistance opposes DAPL because it threatens air and water resources in the region and further downstream, and because the pipeline trajectory is cutting through Native American sacred territories and unceded Treaty lands. Harm to Native areas has already occurred when DAPL personnel deliberately desecrated documented burial grounds and other culturally important sites. Native American opponents to the project emphasize that the DAPL struggle is about larger Native liberation, self-determination and survival at the hands of colonial corporations and compliant government actors.
Over the last months, an ever growing number of Native water protectors and their thousands of allies have converged peacefully in the pipeline construction area to halt further construction of the project. In response to this strictly-peaceful, on-site resistance, police from multiple U.S. states and agencies, members of the U.S. National Guard, and armed private security forces working for project sponsors have used military equipment, tactics and weapons to intimidate, assault, arrest and otherwise commit grievous human rights violations against water protectors and their allies. Indiscriminate use of attack dogs, rubber bullets, concussion grenades, tazers and mace are reported, while journalists covering the assault on non-violent water protectors have been arrested. Protesters that have been arrested have been subjected to inhumane treatment that involved, amongst other things, being locked up naked, or cramped without food and warmth into dog kennels.
The debacle has escalated into a national crisis and an international scandal. A member of the UN’s Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues has been deployed to North Dakota to monitor the situation, while President Obama has intervened to ask the Army Corps of Engineers to examine alternative routes for the pipeline. Meanwhile, the protest at Standing Rock is backed by over a million – and growing – allies worldwide, with numerous solidarity actions springing up across the United States and beyond, including protests at EPFI headquarters and outlets.
The world is closely watching how all actors involved will deal with the situation, including the banks that provide financial support to the project. Given the presumed Indigenous rights commitments of EPFIs, it is for us inexplicable that gross violations of Native land titles, threats to water sources and the desecration of burial grounds have not been identified early on as reasons for EPFIs to not provide funding for this project. However, this unfortunately fits into a documented and consistent pattern of disrespect of local communities and Indigenous rights by EPFI-backed projects worldwide.
We understand that it is not the role of the EP Association to intervene in specific project situations. Nevertheless, we consider it crucial for the credibility of the Equator Principles as an effective safeguard against violation of Indigenous Peoples’ rights that your meeting calls upon the EPFIs involved in financing DAPL that they take swift action to stop the ongoing violation of the rights of Native Americans.
This for now requires that all further loan disbursements to the project are put on hold, and that the EPFIs involved demand from the project sponsors an immediate halt to the construction of the pipeline and all associated structures, until all outstanding issues are resolved to the full satisfaction of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.
We kindly request to hear from you as soon as possible on how the EP Annual Meeting has dealt with these two crucial issues and suggest that we further discuss them at our already planned meeting in January.
We wish you a good and productive meeting.

Paris, France ",Climate Finance Day: BNP Paribas failing to respect coal finance commitments,BNP Paribas ,France,Polska Grupa Energetyczna (PGE) ,energy plants - coal | energy plants - nuclear | mining - coal ,Poland,"
On the eve of Climate Finance Day, taking place tomorrow in Casablanca ahead of next week’s UN climate summit in Marrakech, a new NGO briefing has uncovered how French bank BNP Paribas has still not blacklisted Poland’s biggest power producer PGE from financial support. BNP Paribas pledged a year ago to stop funding coal mining and power companies which are not diversifying away from coal, yet PGE has plans to expand the Polish coal industry. 
The briefing, published jointly by Friends of the Earth France, Fair Finance France, BankTrack and the Polish ‘Foundation Development YES Open-Pit Mines NO’, analyses the measures adopted by French banks since last year to reduce their support for the coal industry. It finds that, in spite of some progress since bringing in new coal restrictions around last year’s Paris Climate Summit, French banks continue to be involved in coal financing, and calls on the banks to now rapidly increase their climate ambitions via strong financing policies which they should enact in full.
Lucie Pinson, Private finance campaigner at Friends of the Earth France, said: 
""BNP Paribas is really dragging its heels when it comes to ending finance for companies developing new coal projects. The bank is supposed to have committed not to support companies which fail to diversify and reduce their activities in the coal sector.
“Yet, in Poland, BNP Paribas has still not ruled out support to PGE, while the company is producing 85% of its electricity from coal and is pumping over 83% of its investment budget into coal. BNP Paribas also undertook last year to no longer directly fund new coal power and mining projects in high income countries such as Poland, yet continuing to do so via indirect support such as corporate loans or the issuance of new bonds is completely hypocritical.""  
Kuba Gogolewski, Finance Campaigner at Foundation Development YES - Open-Pit Mines NO, said: 
""By supporting PGE as it is building coal plants, planning huge new open-pit lignite mines and helping to keep afloat the country’s collapsing mining sector  BNP Paribas is providing a shot in the arm for an industry stuck in the past and is helping to condemn Polish communities who aspire to a healthier and cleaner future. BNP Paribas has to start listening to the majority of the Polish population who want new investments to deliver a new economy, one based on energy efficiency and renewable energy. It should now exclude PGE from future financial support.""
Other than BNP Paribas’ activities in Poland, the new briefing also evaluates and compares all the measures adopted by France’s top banks over the last 12 months aimed at reducing their support to coal. It concludes that BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole, Natixis and Société Générale can contribute to the achievement of the 1.5°C climate change target but only if they stop supporting coal quickly and entirely.
Lucie Pinson commented: 
""Respecting the goals of the Paris Agreement certainly requires banks to adopt policies which exclude funding for the coal industry, but these policies also have to be implemented. As the Paris Agreement comes into force, for France’s top banks it’s highly regrettable that not only do the policy improvements made not go far enough to respond to the climate emergency, but by and large they are still being implemented slowly and very inconsistently.""
Notes for editors:
1. See the briefing (in French) published today.
2. Far from seeking to diversify, on 31 December 2015 the Polish power giant PGE stated its intention to spend 83.5% of its investment budget in new coal plants and the modernisation of existing coal plants, compared with less than 1% for renewable energy. See page 90 of the company’s Financial Statement for 2015.

Paris, Nijmegen ",Crédit Agricole and Société Générale announce end to financing of coal power projects,Crédit Agricole ,France,Cirebon 2 coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Indonesia,"
One week before Climate Finance Day, top French banks Crédit Agricole and Société Générale have followed the lead of Natixis and announced the end of their financing for coal power plant projects globally, moves welcomed by Friends of the Earth France. However, the group criticised Crédit Agricole and Société Générale for pressing on with support for new coal power projects in Indonesia and the Dominican Republic. BNP Paribas now finds itself as the only major French bank not to have committed to ending its direct financial support for coal power plants.

 

The new policy measures from Crédit Agricole and Société Générale  complement other coal finance restrictions adopted by both banks in 2015 when they announced an end to their direct financing of coal mining projects and a cessation of direct financial support for coal power projects in ‘high income’ countries .

Lucie Pinson, private finance campaigner for Friends of the Earth France, commented:


""Crédit Agricole and Société Générale have lined up next to Natixis which in 2015 grasped that the only credible policy was one which ruled out all project financing for new coal plants worldwide. BNP Paribas now finds itself isolated as the last major French bank which continues to permit direct financial support for coal plants. However, just like Crédit Agricole, BNP Paribas committed at the Paris COP last year to do everything possible in order to ensure that the objectives of the Paris Agreement are met or exceeded. 


""BNP Paribas must now make the same commitment as its peers so that the French banking sector can become the global leader in ending direct financial support for coal, the sector which remains the most incompatible with the objectives of the Paris Agreement.""

 

The climate impacts of these new moves from Crédit Agricole and Société Générale are limited, however, as they apply only to project financing. The majority of banks’ support for the coal industry is done through business financing and services.

 
Yann Louvel, Climate and energy campaign coordinator for BankTrack, commented:

 

""The crucial thing right now is to prevent hundreds of new coal plant projects around the world from accessing finance, whether it be direct or indirect financing. The latest announcements from Crédit Agricole and Société Générale may be going in the right direction, but they remain insufficient as the banks are still able to finance the companies which build these projects.


""Only Société Générale is saying that it intends to reduce its support to coal companies in order to be in line with the 2 degrees scenario trajectory of the International Energy Agency by 2020. This is an interesting approach from the bank, but it needs to be complemented by the adoption of specific exclusion criteria in order to send a clear signal to companies in the coal sector."" 


Friends of the Earth France has also criticised the new commitments from Crédit Agricole and Société Générale as they do not apply to coal power projects in Indonesia and the Dominican Republic where both banks are involved and, in the case of Société Générale, the commitments will only take effect in 2017. 

Lucy Pinson concluded:


""We denounce the double game of Crédit Agricole and Société Générale, as they have not withdrawn from proposed coal power plant projects in Indonesia, although no funding has been decided yet in these cases. We also remain cautious about how this new commitment from Société Générale will be applied, as the bank has recently been violating all of its coal power policies dating as far back as 2011 with its financing of the heavily polluting and outdated Punta Catalina coal plant in the Dominican Republic.""

2. See a summary (in French) of coal finance commitments made by French banks in 2015


3. BNP Paribas is a signatory to the Paris Pledge for Action.


4. Société Générale’s policy indicates how it intends to operationalise this commitment by reducing its exposure to the extraction of coal by 14% and limiting the coal share in its financed energy mix to 19% by the end of 2020. The bank has also laid out a specific exclusion criterion, applying to companies whose main activity is related to coal, but it is still insufficient and only applies to new customers, not its existing customers.


5. Crédit Agricole is involved in the Tanjung Jati B 2 and Cirebon 2 coal power projects in Indonesia. Société Générale is involved in Tanjung Jati B 2 and has already disbursed finance for the Punta Catalina project in the Dominican Republic.

San Fransisco ",New study exposes serious threats to Texas coastal communities,,,,,,"
A study released today by Rainforest Action Network (RAN) reveals significant hazards posed by the development of new liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals in the Rio Grande Valley region of Texas. The report, Rio Grande Valley: At Risk from Fracked Gas Terminals, documents in detail how the projects would harm the the climate, the environment and the health and economy of surrounding communities and warns banks against investing in this infrastructure.
Rio Grande Valley is a wetlands paradise for falcons, highly endangered ocelots, and fisheries. It also is home to thriving fishing, shrimping, and ecotourism industries that stand to be ruined by the proposed onslaught of fracked gas terminals: almost 2,400 acres of sprawling industrial facilities, including flaring towers hundreds of feet tall, millions of gallons of effluent releases and a quadrupling of local air pollution. The report shows how these export facilities are the lynchpin in a long process of greenhouse gas pollution, starting with fracking wells that leak methane, to dangerous pipelines, to these terminals that then export LNG on massive tankers to be burned abroad.
Since 2013, major banks have sunk USD 467 billion for companies building LNG export infrastructure. The proposed terminals are part of a national frenzy to build out dozens of terminals for gas export, virtually guaranteeing that many will end up as stranded assets. Learning from the cautionary tale of the coal industry, another dirty energy commodity that went bust, banks would do well to steer clear of this financial gamble.
""This study puts banks on notice: fracked gas and its infrastructure is a bridge to disaster for places like the Rio Grande Valley. These projects export a commodity that is even worse for the climate than coal and represent a blatant deviation from U.S. climate commitments,"" said Jason Opeña Disterhoft, Senior Campaigner with Rainforest Action Network.
At a time when the world's nations have agreed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change, leading financial institutions have continued business as usual investment in extreme fossil fuels in direct contradiction of global consensus. If governments follow through on the Paris agreement and limit carbon emissions, these investments could likely result in significant losses.

Nijmegen, the Netherlandss ","UNESCO recommends cancellation of Rampal coal plant in Bangladesh, increasing reputation risk for Ex-Im Bank of India ",Export-Import Bank of  (Exim Bank) ,India,Rampal coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Bangladesh,"
A UNESCO monitoring mission report released today, recommending that the proposed Rampal coal plant project in Bangladesh be “cancelled and relocated to a more suitable location where it would not impact negatively on the Sundarbans Reserved Forest”, has been welcomed by BankTrack.  The UN agency’s report findings presented to the Bangladeshi government have also increased pressure on the Export-Import Bank of India to reconsider a potential USD 1.6 billion loan for the project or risk taking a major reputational hit.


The report follows a fact-finding mission to Bangladesh in March this year undertaken by the Secretariat of UNESCO’s World Heritage Committee and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature to assess the risks of proposed coal power projects on the Sundarbans, the world’s largest mangrove forest and a designated UNESCO World Heritage site.


The ‘cancel and relocate’ Rampal recommendation to the Bangladeshi government is based on a catalogue of egregious shortcomings and risks which, as the report describes in extensive detail, stem from the Rampal project promoter’s inadequate assessment of the 1320 megawatt coal plant’s environmental impacts on the Sundarbans.
The proposed financing of the estimated USD 2 billion coal plant involves a 30% equity investment from the promoter, the Bangladesh-India Friendship Power Company, a joint venture between India’s National Thermal Power Corporation and the Bangladesh Power Development Board, and 70% debt financing from the Export-Import Bank of India, majority owned by the Indian state. 


To date, no other major international bank has been prepared to get involved in debt financing for the Rampal plant. With media reports suggesting that the Export-Import Bank of India has been aiming for financial close on the project by the third quarter of 2016 , the bank’s chairman and managing director, Yaduvendra Mathur, acknowledged in June this year that participation in the project could involve a reputation risk. 

Johan Frijns, director of BankTrack, said: “The UNESCO recommendation that the Rampal coal plant should be cancelled is very welcome news for the Sundarbans. Ex-Im India needs to consider the report’s findings seriously and in good faith rather than ignoring them. 


“There is a reason why no major international bank has been prepared to go near Rampal. It’s called ‘fatal blow to reputation’ and that blow has now arrived via this damning UNESCO report. The threats posed to the wondrous, unique Sundarbans ecosystem by this coal plant, and the inevitable cumulative air and water pollution it will deliver, have been known for years. Ex-Im India must heed these objective warnings and not finance the project or its reputation will be seriously compromised in the eyes of the international investors on which it relies for funding.""

Greig Aitken, BankTrack's coal campaigner, said: “We are also very concerned about the worsening atmosphere of intimidation that is being directed towards opponents of the Rampal project. The Government of Bangladesh has to accept that many people in the country do not want to see the Sundarbans tarnished by this highly questionable investment, and they have a fundamental democratic right to voice their concerns without harassment, fear of reprisals and unfounded allegations which place lives in danger.”

Washington DC ","World Bank secretly funding coal explosion in Asia despite President Kim warning, “We are finished”",,,,,,"
The World Bank Group has secretly funded a coal boom in Asia despite announcing a moratorium on such projects in 2013, according to the results of a new investigation.
World Bank President Jim Yong Kim has spoken forcefully about the dangers of new coal projects. ""If Asia implements the coal-based plans right now, I think we are finished,"" he said. Yet the World Bank continues to fund coal and other projects that have led to severe environmental damage and human rights abuses through multilayered financial transactions that exist beyond the scrutiny of the public.
The IFC, the World Bank's private-sector arm, is funding these projects through its highly opaque support for commercial banks, private equity funds and other financial intermediaries.
During a months-long investigation, Inclusive Development International, a human rights organization, uncovered 91 harmful projects that the IFC is funding through the back door. Many of the projects are coal-fired power plants that are accelerating global climate change and deforestation. The research tackled only a small portion of the IFC's sprawling financial-sector portfolio, doubtless leaving many projects uncovered. Despite the limited scope, the findings strongly suggest that the problem is widespread and systemic.
""This shocking exposé lays bare the IFC's climate double-whammy: not only funding a boom in coal-fired power plants, but also tearing down the forests to mine the coal. It's clear that IFC lending in the financial sector is out of control and directly undermining President Kim's climate pledges,"" said Kate Geary, Forest Campaign Manager for Bank Information Center, Europe.
Financial-sector lending represents a sea change in how the IFC does business. After decades of lending almost exclusively to companies and projects, the World Bank Group member is now outsourcing the bulk of its development work to for-profit financial institutions. Between 2011 and 2015, the IFC provided $40 billion to these financial intermediaries, who then invested the money as they saw fit, with little apparent oversight.
""The IFC contends that financial-sector lending is helping small businesses in developing countries access credit, driving economic growth and reducing poverty. Yet our investigation found that IFC's intermediaries are in fact using World Bank Group funds to bankroll some of the largest, most harmful corporations in the world,"" said David Pred, Managing Director of Inclusive Development International.
The results of the investigation, released today, reveal that projects and companies financed by IFC clients have forcibly evicted and impoverished tens of thousands of people. They have contributed to climate change, polluted the oceans and rivers, and killed endangered species. Activists who have dared to resist them have been jailed, beaten and even murdered.
The projects come from a range of high-risk sectors, such as energy, agribusiness, mining, transportation and infrastructure. They are located in Asia, Africa and Latin America. The findings include some of the most notorious development projects in the world. Yet until now, the IFC's involvement was unknown.
""The results of this research are disturbing. Yet what's arguably even more scandalous is how the IFC conceals where its financial-sector investments ultimately end up. The only way to find this information is to use expensive financial databases and painstakingly pore over company records, putting it out of reach for most affected communities,"" said Pol Vandevoort, International Financial Institution Policy Officer with 11.11.11.
The projects include the proposed Rampal coal plant, located in Bangladesh, which will devastate the Sundarbans, the world's largest remaining mangrove forest, and harm the lives of 2 million people. In Africa, the IFC is connected to some of the continent's largest land grabs, including agribusiness plantations in Gabon, Mozambique and Ethiopia. In Southeast Asia, it is fueling a destructive coal boom and hydropower projects that have or will displace hundreds of thousands.
""While the IFC has tried to distance itself from the projects funded by its intermediaries, the fact is that these banks are brazenly disregarding the IFC's environmental and social requirements. As a result, the World Bank Group has ended up fueling and profiting from business activities responsible for enormous human suffering, environmental devastation and in some cases serious crimes,"" Pred said.
Inclusive Development International, in collaboration with its partners Bank Information Center, Accountability Counsel, Urgewald, and 11.11.11, has released the results of this investigation on its website, where it will be periodically updated with new findings. Over the next six months, the organizations will publish a series of investigative reports, entitled Outsourcing Development: Lifting the Veil on the World Bank's Lending Through Financial Intermediaries, which follows the trail of IFC money and looks at how it impacts people on the ground in developing countries.
The first report in the series, which was released today, examines the contribution of IFC intermediaries to climate change and the destruction of forests. The report, ""Disaster for Us and the Planet"": How the IFC is Funding a Coal Boom, reveals how IFC financial-sector clients have funded at least 41 coal projects since the World Bank announced its moratorium on new coal funding. These new projects have a combined capacity of over 56,000 megawatts. To put that in perspective, that's the entire coal-generating capacity of Germany.
In the Philippines, an island nation that is extremely vulnerable to climate change, the IFC is fueling a coal boom through two commercial banks, Rizal and BDO Unibank. After receiving hundreds of millions of dollars from the IFC, the banks have gone on to fund at least 20 new coal plants.
""Coal kills, and the World Bank's investments are literally killing the people of my country by exacerbating our vulnerability to climate change,"" said Valentino de Guzman of the Philippine Movement for Climate Justice. ""The bank, together with its local cohorts here, must answer to the Philippine people and be held accountable.""
""The lack of oversight by the board of directors must end. Influential World Bank shareholders, including Germany, must address and overcome this systemic failure of the IFC"", said Knud Vöcking, director of Urgewald's program on International Financial Institutions.
The groups are calling upon the IFC to stop investing in banks that fund coal and other destructive projects and start bringing its financial sector investments into line with its Environmental and Social Performance Standards.

Amsterdam ",Two new reports confirm the need for lenders to exit responsibly from the Agua Zarca Hydroelectric Project in Honduras,FMO ,Netherlands,Agua Zarca hydro project ,energy plants - dams,Honduras,"
Last week, the report of an independent fact-finding mission (IM) commissioned by the Dutch development bank, FMO, showed that the lenders failed to ensure that the Agua Zarca Hydroelectric Project in Honduras complied with international standards. The report also stated that the project provoked and deepened violence amongst communities who would be affected by the project. In response to this report, the FMO committed to exit the project in a responsible way after they consult with all stakeholders. SOMO and Both ENDS welcomes FMO's exit from the project and cautions FMO not to pass along this flawed project to another lender.
The report was commissioned by one of the project financiers, FMO, after renowned human rights defender and fierce opponent of the dam Berta Cáceres was murdered in March 2016. The report follows one published last month by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, who condemned the Agua Zarca Project.
Project leads to violence and conflict

Both reports found that free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) was not obtained from the indigenous Lenca community before FMO invested in the project. This is a violation of FMO's own policies and international human rights law. Failure to obtain FPIC led to significant opposition by the indigenous communities, which was met with acts of violence and intimidation, ultimately leading to the murders of two of its leaders. The IM report acknowledges that ""..people in the area lived harmoniously and with no conflict prior to the Project commencement"" and that the ""introduction of the Project provoked disagreement and subsequently conflicts and violence.""
The Special Rapporteur's report went further, questioning why the lenders did not take the violence surrounding the project more seriously, stating, ""It is worrying that, despite this situation, the investing banks never saw a reason to question their support to the Project."" She continued by finding that the violence makes it ""difficult to justify the continuation of the Project even if it were possible to correct the problems related to the lack of prior consultation and adequate impact assessments.""
FMO should ensure commitments and reform its policies

""While FMO's commitment to exit responsibly from the project is welcomed, it is imperative that the mistakes of the past are not repeated and that steps are made towards strengthening and improving FMO's policies,"" said Anna van Ojik, Policy Officer at Both ENDS. ""These reports have demonstrated that FMO still has a long way to go to uphold its human rights responsibilities.""
Inclusive development

""Sadly, this story is far from over. To honor Berta's legacy, the rights of the Lenca people must be respected by the Government of Honduras and all those who seek to develop their land and natural resources,"" said Kris Genovese, Senior Researcher at the Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (SOMO).  ""It shouldn't be a choice between a hydroelectric project or no development at all. The Lenca people must be allowed to determine their own development path.""

Amsterdam ",ING still invests hundreds of millions in polluting coal companies,ING ,Netherlands,Cirebon 2 coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Indonesia,"
ING has granted a loan of EUR 300.1 million to Uniper, EON's fossil fuels spin-off, which made its stock market debut in Frankfurt last week. ING is the only Dutch bank investing in the company, which owns coal and gas power plants in various countries. ING also plans to finance a new coal power plant in Indonesia, contrary to its coal policy, which the bank revised last November to include a commitment not to fund new coal plants. The Fair Bank Guide and BankTrack call on ING to stop all financing to coal companies and to progressively phase out lending to fossil fuel companies.
Fair Bank Guide spokesperson Ike Teuling said: ""ING is starting to look absurd, coming out with fine words in its new coal policy while extending loan after loan to coal companies. The bank is patting itself on the back for its recent sustainability ranking scores, but remains, unlike several other Dutch banks, essentially a fossil fuel bank. ING is making insufficient pace with the crucial transition to renewable energy, and is not contributing to an effective approach to climate change as agreed last year in Paris.""


Uniper operates coal and gas power stations in the Netherlands, but also has interests for example in gas pipelines, storage facilities and gas fields in Russia. Uniper actively lobbies against closure of coal plants. The well-known German energy scientist Heinz-Josef Bontrup has expressed concerns that the spin-off is doomed from the start, as the company is not able to meet the rising demand for renewable energy. The company has been deliberately divested by its former parent company Eon, which is now fully focused on renewable energy generation.
Earlier this year ING Bank issued a new loan of EUR 100 million to Russia's largest coal producer.
Yann Louvel, Climate and Energy Campaign Coordinator for BankTrack, said: ""At the end of 2015, on the eve of the UN Climate Summit, ING introduced a new policy on coal in which the bank clearly states it will not finance new coal plants. Then at the end of August 2016 it was announced that ING, with a consortium of five banks, will lend a total of USD 640 million for a new coal-fired plant in Indonesia, Cirebon 2. This is a flagrant violation of ING's new policy. ING must call off this deal "".

In recent years, ING Bank lent eight times more to fossil-based energy companies than to renewable energy companies, as shown by a research study by the Fair Finance Guide at the end of 2015.


The Dutch Fair Bank Guide and BankTrack call on ING Bank to further tighten its coal policy and not to provide any further credit to coal companies. ING must set clear targets on how the bank will contribute to limiting global warming to a maximum of 1.5 degrees, in accordance with the UN Climate Agreement.

Brussels ",Belgian bank KBC’s new sustainability policy: a mixed bag,KBC ,Belgium,,,,"
KBC
Bank's recent publication of a new sustainability policy has come under public
scrutiny, including from Belgian NGO FairFin which has evaluated the policy and
addressed a range of questions to the bank. Following clarifications from KBC,
FairFin's view is that the new policy marks a step forward for the bank.
However, the policy has regrettably left the door open for KBC to continue its
financing of coal and nuclear weapons.
Frank Vanaerschot, research coordinator at FairFin,
commented: ""With its new sustainability policy, KBC acknowledges that its
financing has implications for climate change, which is certainly a step in the
right direction. Disappointingly, however, the new policy still leaves KBC with
a lot of room for financing very harmful practices.""
""New criteria for coal financing have been introduced,
but with certain exceptions applied to the bank's approach coal, an end to coal
financing at KBC is still a long way off. The policy also covers KBC's approach
to nuclear weapons, yet as the bank does not fully deem these weapons to be
controversial, future financing for them has not been completely ruled out.""
The new sustainability policy covers a range of
sectors, though FairFin's analysis focuses on coal and weapons due to their
highly controversial nature. Moreover these new policies only apply to KBC
credits and insurance activities, and not to investment funds managed by KBC
and offered to its clients.
On coal, KBC has introduced a series of restrictions
for financing, thus recognising its responsibility for decreasing investment
which fuels climate change. Utilities which only produce coal-based electricity
and mining companies which only extract coal are to receive no new financing
from KBC. Nonetheless, an important exception has been made for coal mining and
power companies based in the Czech Republic. These companies will have access
to new financing from KBC if they meet certain additional requirements.
Frank Vanaerschot continued: ""Last year the chairman
of KBC, Thomas Leysen, publicly stated that he ‘personally would not invest in
coal anymore'. Since then we've wondered how this would translate into practice
for Mr Leysen's bank. Now we finally have an answer. The new general
restriction on coal is welcome and positive, however the exception applied to
Czech coal companies is concerning.""
A second element in KBC's new approach to coal policy
concerns ‘mixed companies', those mining companies or utilities which extract
coal or produce electricity based on coal but also extract or use other energy
sources. For these, if a company's coal-based revenues constitute more than 50
percent of its total revenues and it is unable to show how its revenues will
fall below the 50 percent threshold, from now on KBC will provide no new
financing. If the company's coal revenues are lower than 50 percent of its
total revenues, the bank will provide general company financing but no
financing for specific coal related activities.
Electricity production based on oil is also excluded
from KBC's new financing approach. While oil is a rather small source of
electricity production, this new KBC exclusion has to date been rarely seen in
bank policies on fossil fuels. 
With KBC's new approach to the financing of weapons,
only companies with ""very limited arms-related activities"" will be considered
for financing. How limited ""very limited"" actually is remains unclear, and may
be a sensitive grey area as weapons compromise only a small percentage of overall
production for some of the most important weapons manufacturers.
Within this new sectoral approach, KBC also details
how it will finance nuclear weapons. Financing will only be possible if a
company which is involved in the production, development or maintenance of
nuclear weapons makes a written declaration that KBC financing will not be used
for activities related to nuclear weapons. Previous research has shown that KBC
provided a loan of EURO 104 million to SERCO, a company that carries out maintenance
for the recently renewed British nuclear weapons programme Trident.
Frank Vanaerschot concluded: ""We would be curious to learn what
ethical clients think of KBC's new approach to weapons financing. Regardless of
whether or not the bank's financing goes directly to nuclear weapons or not, it
has clearly opted to keep the door open for companies that play a role in the
production and proliferation of nuclear weapons.
""It's very regrettable that on this occasion KBC
failed to include nuclear weapons in its list of controversial weapons
producers, a category commitment the bank made in its sustainability report of
2013.""

San Francisco ",Banks sponsoring ‘Climate Week NYC’ responsible for investing billions in extreme fossil fuels,Bank of America ,United States,,,,"
As ‘Climate Week NYC' kicks off today, Rainforest Action Network 
(RAN) questions the climate integrity of three major event sponsors. RAN
 research shows that these sponsors, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, 
and Bank of the West (BNP Paribas) are helping drive the climate crisis 
by pumping hundreds of billions of dollars into extreme fossil fuels.
Extreme fossil fuels are the most carbon intensive, financially 
risky, and environmentally destructive subsectors of the fossil fuel 
industry and include coal power, coal mining, liquefied natural gas 
(LNG) export terminals, and extreme oil (tar sands, Arctic oil, and 
ultra-deepwater drilling). Rainforest Action Network's 2016 report, Shorting the Climate,
 reveals that between 2013 and 2015, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and
 BNP Paribas (parent company of Bank of the West) banks put $9.89 
billion into coal mining companies, $30.7 billion into the largest coal 
power producers, $74.91 billion into companies building LNG export 
terminals in North America, and $77.3 billion into companies exposed to 
extreme oil.
Amanda Starbuck, RAN Climate and Energy Program Director, said: 
 ""To meet the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, Bank of America, 
JPMorgan Chase and BNP Paribas must stop funding extreme fossil fuels, 
which are simply incompatible with a climate-stable world. Given their 
current investments in climate-wrecking activities, their sponsorship of
 ‘Climate Week NYC' amounts to little more than greenwashing. If these 
banks aspire to be climate leaders,  they must accelerate their exit 
from coal, and commit to getting out of extreme oil and fracked-gas 
terminals as well.""
The Shorting the Climate report, released this past June, 
also showed that leading financial institutions' business-as-usual 
investment in fossil fuels stands in direct contradiction to the global 
consensus to limit global warming.  Between 2013 and 2015, 25 major 
global banks  sank $42 billion in companies active in coal mining; $154 
billion for the 20 largest coal-fired power producers; $306 billion for 
companies that drill extreme oil; and $282 billion for companies 
building LNG export infrastructure.  
Among the 25 major global banks analyzed in Shorting the Climate, JPMorgan Chase was the #1 investor in two extreme fossil fuel subsectors: LNG export terminals and extreme oil.
The report does reflect bank movement on coal mining, where nine of 
the biggest U.S. and European banks committed to reduce funding for the 
coal mining sector since 2015.  Based on their ability to quickly switch
 their stance on coal over the last year alone, banks are capable of 
making the critical choice to cut out extreme fossil fuel investments. 
Not only can they do it, but it is a critical step to follow through on 
promises made in Paris to stabilize the climate.

Melbourne ",New polling shows half of customers prepared to change banks over fossil fuels – as prominent Australians demand climate action,ANZ ,Australia,,,,"
New research released today shows overwhelmingly that Australians 
want their bank to act on climate change by avoiding fossil fuel 
projects, with almost half prepared to change banks if their current 
institution finances projects that damage the environment or worsen 
climate change.
The research comes as an open letter, signed by over sixty civil 
society organisations and dozens of prominent Australians, demands the 
banks get out of fossil fuels by 2030.
Commissioned from Essential Media Communications by financial 
activist group, Market Forces, the poll of 1017 Australians showed that:

74% of customers of the ‘Big Four' banks (ANZ, CommBank, NAB and 
Westpac) believe it important that these banks invest in companies and 
projects that don't harm the environment and contribute to climate 
change;
46% would be more willing to switch banks if this were the case;
73% supported the ‘Big Four' banks agreeing to publicly back to the goal of limiting global warming to below two degrees;
66% agreed banks should avoid funding projects that expand the size of the fossil fuel industry.

Each of the major banks made commitments in late 2015 to help hold 
global warming to below two degrees, in line with the agreement reached 
in Paris. However, Market Forces research released on 4 August showed 
that since their Paris announcements, the ""big four"" banks (ANZ, NAB, 
Commonwealth Bank and Westpac) have collectively loaned AU $5.6 billion to fossil fuel projects and companies around the world.
The carbon emissions that would be created from these new fossil fuel
 projects would amount to 3 billion tonnes, or about six times 
Australia's total annual emissions.
""If we're going to avoid sending global warming beyond a point of no 
return we need all parts of the community and the economy pulling their 
weight. As some of the largest and most powerful companies in Australia,
 our major banks need to start delivering on the commitments they made 
to act on climate change"", said Market Forces Executive Director Julien 
Vincent.
""At the moment, the banks' action on climate change is way out of 
step with their rhetoric. These results show that Australians, 
especially customers of the major banks, endorse their banks taking 
serious action to avoid projects.
""We're not just supporting it, we're demanding it and will campaign until we get it"", said Mr Vincent.
On 7-8 October, Market Forces
 is coordinating a nationwide divestment day, in which hundreds of 
Australians will send the banks a clear message: ""If you choose fossil 
fuels, your customers will choose another bank.""
As part of the campaign, a new open letter is calling on banks to 
make no further investments that expand the size of the fossil fuel 
industry and to reduce exposure to the thermal coal sector to zero by 
2020, and all fossil fuels by  2030.
Signatories include 68 organisations, as well as dozens of prominent 
Australians from all walks of life including authors JM Coetzee and 
Charlotte Wood, musicians Birds of Tokyo, Missy Higgins and 
multi-award-winning composer Nigel Westlake, Professor Ove 
Hoegh-Guldberg, Coordinating Lead Author for the Fifth Assessment Report
 of the IPCC, Bishop George Browning and Laureate Professor Peter 
Singer.

",Swedish banks invest in controversial arms trade,,,,,,"
Sweden's seven largest banks invest nearly five billion SEK in companies that export arms to countries that violate human rights and are involved in armed conflicts. This is revealed in a new report from Fair Finance Guide in Sweden, which urges the banks to stop investing customers' savings in controversial arms trade. A new report examines Swedish banks' investments in 15 companies exporting weapons and military equipment to countries with authoritarian regimes, countries with a lack of political rights and civil liberties, countries in armed conflict, or poor countries which use a disproportionate share of the state budget for military spending.  The report is published jointly by Diakonia and the Swedish Consumers' Association, part of the Fair Finance Guide coalition in Sweden.
""The banks must take a firm stand against this type of controversial arms trade. It contradicts a number of principles of international conventions and regulations that aim to prevent weapons from falling into the wrong hands. A ban on such investments would send an important signal to arms companies and put pressure on other investors to act responsibly"", says Penny Davies, Policy Adviser at Diakonia.
The report shows that all of the seven largest banks in Sweden invest in several of the arms companies through 65 of their savings funds. In total Danske Bank, Handelsbanken, Länsförsäkringar, Nordea, SEB, Skandia and Swedbank invest 4.7 billion Swedish kronor in the companies. Swedbank account for more than half of the amount, while Danske Bank and Handelsbanken invest in the highest number of companies. The report also demonstrates that several of the banks have large gaps in their policies and in some cases do not follow their own guidelines.
All seven banks invest, for example, in companies that have exported weapons to Saudi Arabia - a country that is considered to be particularly controversial because of serious violations of human rights and the country's on-going military activities in neighbouring Yemen. The Saudi-led coalition's attacks in Yemen are accused of violations of international humanitarian law by several human rights organizations. Both non-profit organizations and the European Parliament have demanded an arms embargo against Saudi Arabia. Several of the exported weapons are used in the attacks and some of the arms companies have continued the exports despite the on-going conflict.
""Swedish banks have for many years taken a stand against investing in cluster munitions and anti-personnel land mines, because they often hurt civilians. It is the same problem when it comes to controversial arms trade. Banks must expand their responsibility and ensure that Swedish citizens' savings do not support this type of business"", says Jakob König, project manager for Fair Finance Guide at the Swedish Consumers' Association.

Singapore ",New online platform reveals banks and investors financing companies linked to tropical forest loss in Southeast Asia,ABN AMRO ,Netherlands,,,,"
Today, Rainforest Action Network (RAN), TuK INDONESIA and Profundo announced the launch of a new, interactive online web platform as part of a growing Forests and Finance campaign targeting investors and financial institutions financing companies implicated in tropical deforestation in the Asia Pacific region. The new research tool was introduced with a press conference during a side event at the world's largest sustainable investment conference - the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI) in Singapore.
The research is now available on forestsandfinance.org, providing for the first time a comprehensive assessment into how companies linked to rainforest destruction are financed, with a fully searchable database through various field search functions. The platform also assesses what policies financial institutions have in place for addressing common environmental and social risks involved in forest-risk sector financing and features a number of case studies demonstrating the impacts of some of this financing on forests and local communities. The platform will be updated on a quarterly basis, providing an on-going resource for the responsible investment community, researchers and campaigners.
""The world's biggest banks are pumping billions of dollars a year into tropical forest-risk sectors like pulp & paper, palm oil, rubber and logging, with too few checks on whether clients are actually obeying forest laws or respecting the rights of local communities,"" said Tom Picken, Forests and Finance Campaign Director with Rainforest Action Network. ""This research suggests that banks continue to turn a blind eye to the devastating impacts of their financial services; only tightened financial sector regulation is capable of setting the kind of binding standards needed to stop banks fuelling forest crime.""
The research released today finds that between 2010 and 2015 at least USD38 billion worth of commercial loans and underwriting facilities were provided to just 50 companies that impact natural tropical forests in Southeast Asia, through their production and primary processing operations of palm oil, pulp & paper, rubber and tropical timber. The forest operations of these 50 companies were supported by an additional USD14 billion worth of bond and shareholdings at the start of 2016. The tropical forests of Southeast Asia have some of the highest rates of deforestation in the world resulting from the large-scale expansion of these forest-risk commodities.
""The combined impact of relaxed law enforcement and minimum due diligence standards applied by financial institutions in credit approval processes is adding pressure on the environment, people and business. The devastating forest and land fires of 2015 and new fires in 2016 can be seen as one such impact, but so far none of the financiers have been held responsible for their role in enabling plantation expansion,"" said Rahmawati Retno Winarni, Executive Director with TuK-INDONESIA. ""It is time for the financial authority in Indonesia to come up with regulations setting transparency and accountability standards for the financial sector it supervises. This website shines a spotlight on the problems of uncontrolled finance and will become a platform of communication among stakeholders who share the objectives of sustainability and responsible investment.""
Some of the banks found to be most involved in financing these tropical forest-risk sectors include Malayan Banking, CIMB, DBS, OCBC, Mizuho Financial, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial, Mitsubishi UFJ, HSBC, Standard Chartered, JP Morgan, China Development Bank, Bank Mandiri and Bank Negara Indonesia.
The study finds that even some banks with voluntary environmental and social policies in place are routinely providing loans and other financial services to clients engaged in deforestation and social violations. A primary recommendation is that financial sector regulators in key jurisdictions - such as in Japan, Indonesia, Singapore and the UK - introduce mandatory requirements on banks and investors to conduct robust due diligence screening processes on forest-sector clients, with strong penalties for non-compliance.

Paris ",Coal: Will the Paris Agreement go up in smoke thanks to Crédit Agricole and Société Générale?,Crédit Agricole ,France,Tanjung Jati-B 2 (TJB2) coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Indonesia,"
Crédit Agricole and Société Générale are set to decide this summer whether to finance the extension of the Tanjung Jati B coal power plant in Indonesia, seven months after COP21.  Friends of the Earth France, BankTrack and Greenpeace are calling on the banks not to make this mistake, and to instead withdraw from the project as BNP Paribas has already done. With an action in front of the Eiffel Tower today, Friends of the Earth France has sent a reminder to the banks that with this specific project their COP21 commitments for the climate are at stake. 
Activists from Friends of the Earth France have carried out a banner drop from the first floor of the Eiffel Tower today to denounce the involvement of Crédit Agricole and Société Générale in the 2000 MW extension project (TJB2) of the Tanjung Jati B coal power plant on the island of Java in Indonesia.
The two French banks are currently analysing this project and could finance it despite its incompatibility with the international objective of limiting global warming to well below 2°C, and ideally no more than 1.5°C, adopted in Paris by the international community only a few months ago.  BNP Paribas has already withdrawn from the project, putting pressure on its two peers, whose final decision could have serious consequences for the climate but also for their reputation.
Lucie Pinson, Private Finance campaigner for Friends of the Earth France, said:
""Where are their COP21 commitments? Already up in smoke? Instead of using the money entrusted to them locally, as Crédit Agricole claims to do in its recent ads, the bank will now have to explain to its clients that it is continuing to finance new coal, even after committing to do everything possible to ensure the aims of the Paris Agreement are met or even exceeded.  The same goes for Société Générale, which has committed to align its financing with the 2°C scenario.  Any decision to finance TJB2 would be a shameful hypocrisy.""
This project is part of a bigger – and highly carbon intensive – national energy development plan to develop 13 gigawatts of new coal capacity for Indonesia by 2019, mostly on the densely populated and heavily polluted island of Java. But the banks know as well as NGOs the reports showing that the construction of new coal plants – or even the replacement of old ones – is not possible within the available carbon budget, even using the best available technology, and that a commitment to close the existing coal fleet is now necessary to stay below the 2°C threshold. 
Yann Louvel, Climate and Energy Campaign Coordinator at BankTrack, commented:
""Tanjung Jati B 2 is a key test for the climate and for the banks which made commitments themselves at COP21. As World Bank President Jim Yong Kim reminded us recently, if Indonesia and the other South-East Asia countries build coal plants as planned, we are finished and this will spell disaster for us and our planet. It is therefore vital that these projects never see the light of day, and that's why NGOs are tracking investors so closely in this region of the world.""
Bondan Andriyanu, from Greenpeace Indonesia, and who recently met with the two banks in May 2016, concluded: 
""Financing TJB2 is to choose pollution, many deaths, and deforestation. As with many other Asian countries, we are already suffocating because of coal. Already 6,500 people die prematurely from coal every year and TJB2 could add 1,000 more. Not only will populations without access to electricity not benefit from TJB2, nor from other coal plants projects, but the expansion of coal mining concessions to meet the planned doubling of coal consumption will worsen deforestation in our country. Alternatives exist in Indonesia, and the country's enormous renewables potential could be developed more cost-effectively than coal. Crédit Agricole and Société Générale committed to take into account all these factors. We are now expecting them to follow the example of BNP Paribas and to withdraw from the project"".
With today's action at the Eiffel Tower, the symbol of COP21, Friends of the Earth France has sent a reminder to the banks that their reputation is at stake and that the sincerity of their climate commitment and to the energy transition will be judged on the decision they take in the TJB2 case.
Friends of the Earth Japan is also today sending a letter to Nexi, one of the other financial institutions involved, demanding its withdrawal.
Notes for editors: 
1. Project financing is expected to close this summer, after receipt of all the preliminary studies required by funders. The other banks involved in the $4 billion project are BTMU, Mizuho Bank, SMBC and Sumitomo Trust.

4. After some commitments regarding its support for coal mines and coal plants in May and September 2015, Crédit Agricole signed the Paris Pledge for Action.
5. See the summary of Société Générale's commitments before COP21.
6. The report ""The Coal Gap: planned coal-fired power plants inconsistent with 2˚C and threaten achievement of INDCs"", published in December 2015 by Climate Action Tracker, shows that even without new construction, emissions generated by electricity production from coal in 2030 would still be 150% above the necessary level to limit global warming to within the 2°C threshold.
Another report published earlier this year by Greenpeace, Sierra Club and CoalSwarm has shown that despite the fact that more and more coal plants are being closed, the speed of the closures is not fast enough to compensate for the opening of new plants:
The most recent report from Ecofys shows that even the use of the best available technologies for coal plants does not make coal compatible with the objectives adopted at COP21.

Sydney ",Human rights groups call out the financial sector’s association with abuse,,,Offshore Detention Centres ,Immigration detention,Australia,"
Australia's abusive offshore detention centres are sustained by a vast network of global banks and investment funds that are failing to meet their responsibility to respect human rights. Today the campaign against the Australian government's offshore detention centres (ODCs) moved further into the corporate sphere, exposing the links between Spanish infrastructure giant Ferrovial and its financial backers, and gross human rights abuses in the ODCs.
In a joint report, ‘Association with Abuse', released today GetUp!'s No Business in Abuse campaign and the Human Rights Law Centre call on Ferrovial's financial backers to take immediate action. Given the human rights abuses being perpetrated in the ODCs the financial sector needs to act to ensure it is not implicated.
Ferrovial currently runs Australia's system of privatised offshore detention centres following its takeover of Australian-listed Broadspectrum (formerly Transfield). While the company has committed not to tender for work beyond the current contract's expiration in February 2017, they are not off the hook. The men, women and children in the camps on Nauru and Manus Island can't wait. And Ferrovial does not act alone, the company's financial sector stakeholders, including investors and financiers, are implicated in the harm.
The HRLC's Director of Advocacy, Rachel Ball, said operating the offshore centres, or propping them up through financial support, is inconsistent with the corporate responsibility to respect human rights in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
The offshore detention centres on Nauru and Manus Island continue to be the sites of horrific and ongoing violations, including illegal detention, sexual assault and child abuse. 1500 people, including children and pregnant women, are still being warehoused in intolerable conditions. Earlier this year the United Nations' refugee agency, which undertakes regular visits to Manus Island and Nauru, described the current policy as ""immensely harmful"" and called for refugees and asylum seekers to be immediately moved to humane conditions. Despite the well-publicised nature of these abuses companies continue to benefit from lucrative government contracts to operate the ODCs.
Shen Narayanasamy, GetUp's Human Rights Campaign Director and Executive Director of No Business in Abuse explained, ""This report increases the pressure on both Ferrovial and the Turnbull government to find an immediate alternative for the people still held in defiance of international law on Manus Island and Nauru.""
Ms Ball added, ""The indefinite warehousing of people seeking asylum and refugees in inhumane conditions is not acceptable business for any company. Ferrovial's investors and financiers must uphold international business and human rights standards by rejecting their current association with gross human rights abuse. Any association with abuse on this scale brings with it significant operational instability, legal liability and reputational damage. It's time for the financial sector to take immediate action and end support of human rights abuse.""
Ms Narayanasamy continued, ""The Turnbull Government promised to keep the camps open, but it is facing an emerging global corporate consensus that no respectable business can associate itself with the gross human rights abuses in these camps,"" said Ms Narayanasamy.

Washington, D.C. ",American retirement funds are destroying rainforests,,,,,,"
A new transparency tool, ""Deforestation Free Funds,"" shows which global mutual funds contain palm-oil-related holdings, the fastest growing cause of rainforest destruction today. Friends of the Earth and As You Sow created this free online database to allow individual investors, for the first time ever, to determine their links to tropical deforestation and land grabs. The tool then empowers investors to demand deforestation-free investment options and responsible policies from workplace retirement plan managers and major fund families.
The search platform, which currently encompasses 6,500 global mutual funds, will be expanded in the future to include all market drivers of deforestation. Currently, some 10 percent of the global palm oil industry is financed by equity investors, including many mutual funds. As of June 2016, U.S. mutual funds had a net investment of more than $5 billion dollars in palm oil producers.
Andrew Behar, CEO of As You Sow, said, ""Investments in palm oil are embedded in our pension funds, IRAs, and 401(k)s but most of us are not even aware of it. This web tool empowers investors to know exactly what they own so that they can pressure fund managers to implement sustainable investment policies and find investment options that support a forest-friendly future.""
A new report by Friends of the Earth, which accompanies the database, names the top 10 U.S. asset managers invested in palm oil production, including BlackRock, Vanguard, CalPERS, TIAA-CREF and Dimensional Fund Advisors. The report also shows that none of these firms have clear criteria for disclosing or avoiding risks related to deforestation and land rights. ""Are You Invested in Exploitation?"" outlines ways that these institutions can take greater responsibility for the social and environmental impacts of their investments.
Jeff Conant, senior international forests program manager at Friends of the Earth, said, ""When Americans put their hard-earned money in savings and retirement accounts, they believe they are preparing for a better future. But large asset managers undermine that very future, globally speaking, by putting this money into destructive agribusiness firms,  generally through complex investment chains and failures in due diligence. Financial managers must stop investing in companies that grab land from subsistence farmers and Indigenous people in order to install massive plantations with dangerous, low-wage labor.""
The rapid expansion of oil palm plantations across the tropics has caused social conflict and human rights abuses in countries like Indonesia, Liberia, Nigeria, Guatemala and Malaysia. Destruction of native rainforests is driving orangutans, Sumatran tigers and other endangered species to the edge of extinction. Processed palm oil is used ubiquitously in over half of the packaged consumer products on shelves today, including lotions, shampoo, toothpaste, cookies, breakfast bars, instant noodles and donuts. It can be very challenging for consumers to avoid palm oil; this joint effort focuses on shareholder advocacy as an avenue to greater tropical forest protections.
In the past few years, thanks to public pressure, dozens of consumer brands and palm oil traders have promised to stop burning and destroying forests, grabbing land, and abusing human rights. But promises have been slow to materialize, and the finance industry has yet to address its role in driving destructive palm oil expansion. Furthermore, as ""Are You Invested in Exploitation?"" argues, the palm oil sector has concentrated tremendous wealth and power in countries with weak democracies and poor human rights records. These conditions enable corruption--something that investors should studiously avoid.
The tool highlights socially responsible funds that carefully consider issues like the environment and human rights. Some of these funds invest in companies specifically to gain a voice at the table, engage management and create real improvements in the company's behavior. If individuals look up their investments and aren't satisfied, Deforestation Free Funds can show them better-rated alternatives, and amplify their calls for reform. Future evolutions of the website will include information about all commodified sources of deforestation, including timber, paper, cattle, soy and sugar.

Nijmegen, the Netherlands ",Environmental organisations call on major European and US banks to stop bankrolling EPH,,,EPH ,energy plants - coal | energy plants - hydro  | energy plants - nuclear | mining - coal ,Czech Republic,"
A group of environmental organisations has today sent a series of open letters to major banks involved in granting over 3 billion euros in loans to Czech energy company EPH since 2012. The letters call attention to the role of these banks in financing the expansion of EPH into Europe's old fossil fuel assets to the point where the company is set to become the third-most polluting utility on the continent, despite only having existed for seven years.
The following banks have participated in loans to EPH since 2012, and have received a letter:

UniCredit
Citibank
ING Bank
Raiffeisen Bank
HSBC
Commerzbank
JPMorgan Chase
Royal Bank of Scotland
Societé Générale

The letters call on them to stop bankrolling EPH by blacklisting the company for further transactions. Several of these banks have divestment commitments, making their support of EPH even more egregious.
The letters state: ""Since its foundation in 2009, EPH, through its subsidiaries EP Energy and EP infrastructure, has been buying up fossil fuel assets that other companies are keen to divest. In doing this, the company is going against current market trends, as well as the overall direction of climate policy in Europe. It takes an unsustainable - or at least highly risky - business model to make this viable.""
EPH identifies the expansion of renewable energy, as well as energy efficiency, as a serious threat to the profitability of its coal and gas power plants.  It will definitely be looking to keep the power plants it recently acquired running as long as possible to generate maximum return on its investments. This can only hinder Europe's efforts to reduce CO2 emissions and implement the Paris Agreement. The envisaged purchase of Vattenfall's lignite business is another instance of this trend, even if the banks receiving these letters did not explicitly support it.
Signatories of the letters comprise BankTrack, E3G, urgewald and Sandbag. Friends of the Earth France has signed the letter directed at Société Générale. 
Quotes
Sabrina Schulz (E3G): ""This is a broader problem than just EPH. Other companies, among them Australian financial group Macquarie, as well as Czech ČEZ and Polish PGE, seem to be following a similar strategy. This overlooked trend risks seriously undermining Europe's effort to fight climate change.""
Yann Louvel (BankTrack): ""In the post Paris Agreement world, with global commitments now in place aimed at keeping the rise in global temperatures below 1.5°C, bankrolling dodgy coal companies like EPH has no place. Most of the banks which have coughed up billions for EPH's dirty business model in the past have subsequently taken some first steps to distance themselves from coal. As EPH looks to intensify and develop its lignite coal interests, it is now time for the banks to blacklist this climate bad boy once and for all.""

","Branch closures “kill off” SME lending, new MYM research finds",,,,,,"

SME lending growth reduces by 63% in postcodes that lose a bank branch, new research report by Move Your Money finds
Postcodes that lose their ""last bank in town"" suffer a 104% drop in SME lending growth, pushing net lending negative 
""Last bank in town"" closures see those postcodes lose an average of £1.6m in business lending over a year - usually in the poorest areas
Widespread accusations and evidence that banks are intentionally targeting poor areas for closures - even though they need banks most
MPs to debate crisis of bank branch closures in Parliament today

New research launched today by Move Your Money reveals for the first time the devastating economic impact that bank branch closures are having on local communities.
The research finds that postcodes that lose a bank branch suffer an average 63% drop in business lending growth. Postcodes that lose their last bank suffer even more, seeing their business lending drop by 104% on average - meaning that banks are actually withdrawing money from those areas.
Postcodes that lose their ""last bank in town"" receive an average of £1.6 million less lending only a year later. Given that these are already some of the poorest areas with higher rates of business failure than the UK average, these branch closures drive cycles of local economic depression and stagnation, the report finds.
Launching the research, Fionn Travers-Smith, Campaign Manager for Move Your Money, said:
""The UK's biggest banks are abandoning communities across the country, and today for the first time we can see the incredible damage that this is happening - predominantly to those communities that need bank branches the most.
Free-market competition has abjectly failed to provide a banking and financial system that works in the interests of people and society, and the crisis in bank branch closures is just the latest proof of that.
Given the economic and financial chaos caused by the Brexit vote, it's now more important than ever that banks keep lending to small businesses and keep local bank branches in rural and poorer areas open to achieve this.
The Government must now intervene to ensure adequate access is provided for all, not just the rich, by strengthening the Access to Banking Protocol, and by recognising the case for public provision of critical banking services.""
The research is launched on the same day that MP's were scheduled to debate the crisis of bank branch closures in Parliament. Since 1989, the UK has lost more than 53% of its bank branches, with UBS predicting the closure of a further 50% in the next ten years.
There are now currently 1,500 communities that have no bank remaining, and a further 840 communities precariously placed with only one bank branch left.
The banks claim that branch closures are in response to falling demand, but the research reports that usage figures are widely misrepresented and manipulated by the banks. Instead, banks are intentionally targeting poorer and rural areas for closures, the report finds.
Move Your Money makes a series of recommendations on how to improve banking provision and access to the financial system in the UK - first, by strengthening the Access to Banking Protocol which is currently under review, and secondly by recognising and investigating the case for public provision of key banking infrastructure, including branches.

Nijmegen ",Most banks failing to deliver on UN human rights principles: new research,,,,,,"

45 banks benchmarked and ranked on integration of UN Guiding Principles
Over half of banks are “laggards”, showing little or no evidence of human rights due diligence
Report identifies three major gaps that all banks are failing to address

Most banks have made little progress towards meeting UN human rights principles introduced five years ago this month, and even the most advanced banks have significant gaps in their approach. These are the conclusions of the second edition of BankTrack's ""Banking with Principles?"" report, a major benchmarking study released today.
The report evaluated 45 of the largest banks globally on their progress towards integrating the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights into their policies, due diligence processes and reporting.  The report comes five years after the Principles were unanimously endorsed by the UN Human Rights Council in June 2011. Banks were ranked against 12 criteria based on the text of the UN Principles, in four categories: policies, due diligence commitments, reporting and provision of access to remedy.
More than half of the banks assessed (24 out of 45) scored 3 out of 12 or less, showing little or no evidence that they are actively assessing the potential human rights impacts of their finance. These laggards include major Western banks such as Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Société Générale, Crédit Agricole, Morgan Stanley, Standard Chartered and Bank of America, as well as the ""big three"" Japanese banks and all four Chinese banks assessed.
Eight banks were identified as front-runners, scoring more than 6 out 12. Rabobank and Citi topped the list, followed by ANZ, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and UBS. All have developed human rights policies and due diligence processes, and report on their human rights impacts to some degree. However, no bank scored more than 8 out of 12, indicating that all have substantial progress to make before they are fulfilling their human rights responsibilities.
The report also identifies three requirements from the UN Guiding Principles that are not being met by any of the banks assessed. Firstly, no banks showed clearly how they include meaningful consultation with potentially affected people in their human rights due diligence. Secondly, bank reporting on specific human rights impacts was limited and insufficient to evaluate how banks had responded. Thirdly, no banks have yet met the requirement to establish or participate in effective complaint mechanisms.
Fifteen banks improved their scores since BankTrack's first ""Banking with Principles?"" report in December 2014; half of the 30 banks assessed in both reports. Of the remainder, 13 showed no progress and two declined slightly. 
The report follows two Human Rights Impact Briefings published by BankTrack earlier this year, which focus on links between bank finance and serious allegations of human rights abuses: the first looks at labour standards violations in IOI Corporation's Malaysian plantations, and the second at Drummond and paramilitary violence in Colombia. Banks were invited to respond to show how they had met their responsibilities to attempt to avoid or mitigate these impacts, however most banks were unwilling to provide details on the actions they had taken in specific cases. 
Ryan Brightwell, BankTrack's human rights campaign coordinator, commented: ""The Guiding Principles are a standard of business conduct that is expected by UN member states. Yet we have to conclude that, five years on from their adoption, the level of implementation in the banking sector remains poor.
""It is particularly worrying that banks are apparently ignoring important principles entirely, especially those which require them to ensure that people potentially affected by their finance have their voices heard. Such alarming gaps call into question whether the essentially self-regulatory approach of the UN Guiding Principles is working. ""
Andreas Missbach of the Berne Declaration, a BankTrack board member, commented, ""Already in 2013 the Thun Group of banks issued a discussion paper that made clear that bank human rights policies should ‘establish clear accountabilities and allocation of responsibility, monitoring and reporting requirements and an escalation procedure for evaluating risks'. That two of the seven signatories of this discussion paper (BBVA and RBS) do not meet this basic requirement is worrying. Equally disappointing is the fact that four of the initial signatories, including Credit Suisse and UBS, did not improve at all since BankTrack's first assessment.""

Update: ""Banking with Principles?""  on BHRRC:
In September 2016 the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre (BHRRC) published the above report together with six responses from banks. BHRRC invited 6 banks to respond to the findings: Santander, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Credit Agricole, Bank of America and Sumitomo Mitsui (all banks which had not responded to BankTrack for the first or second Banking with Principles reports). Responses from Credit Agricole, HSBC, Santander, and Sumitomo Mitsui were recieved. Bank of America and Goldman Sachs did not respond.

Nijmegen ","As the UN Guiding Principles turn five, BankTrack research shows three major gaps in banking sector implementation",,,,,,"
On the fifth anniversary of the endorsement by the UN Human Rights Council of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights today, BankTrack highlights three alarming gaps in the human rights practices of all banks, shown by its research into the human rights policies, processes and reporting of 45 international banks over the past three months. 


BankTrack has evaluated banks against the requirements of the UN Guiding Principles for the forthcoming update of its ""Banking with Principles?"" benchmarking study.  Its research uncovered three key issues where none of the banks evaluated are performing as required:

Firstly, when conducting human rights due diligence, banks should ""involve meaningful consultation with potentially affected groups"", according to Principle 18. None of the 45 banks investigated are clearly articulating how their human rights due diligence takes into account meaningful consultation with people whose rights may be impacted. Some banks showed how their due diligence process involves consultation with external stakeholders like NGOs, but none are including the views of rights-holders in their human rights due diligence in a systematic manner.

Secondly, banks should meaningfully report on how they address specific human rights impacts. Guiding Principle 21 states that human rights reporting should ""provide information that is sufficient to evaluate the adequacy of an enterprise's response to a particular human rights impact"". None of the 45 banks studies are reporting formally on how they address specific human rights impacts in a way that enables an evaluation of its response, for example by disclosing concrete actions taken or follow-up steps requested. Reporting by banks on specific human rights impacts identified remains rare.

Thirdly, banks, like all business, are required to ""establish or participate in effective operational grievance mechanisms"", to enable individuals and communities whose rights may be impacted to raise complaints to the enterprise directly (Principle 29), Yet no bank has been found to operate a grievance mechanism that approaches meeting the Guiding Principles' effectiveness criteria.

Ryan Brightwell, BankTrack's Human Rights Campaign Coordinator, said: ""Five years have passed since the adoption of the UN Guiding Principles, but banks have still not internalised what is perhaps their most important message: focus on risks to rights holders rather than risks to your business. While some progress has been made over the last 18 months, our research indicates banks are not yet finding ways to listen to the views of people and communities affected by the companies and projects they finance.


""Establishing direct and effective complaints channels, as required by the Guiding Principles, would help break down the barriers between banks and impacted communities. Yet even after a high-level UN panel last year specifically called out the finance sector's lack of progress on providing access to remedy, we still see no signs that banks have even started thinking about how to develop such mechanisms.""

Nijmegen, San Francisco ",New report finds banks betting on climate change,Banco Santander ,Spain,Rampal coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Bangladesh,"
A report released today by Rainforest Action Network (RAN), BankTrack, Sierra Club and Oil Change International provides the first look at bank financing for fossil fuels since the Paris Climate Agreement, showing that the world's biggest banks are driving climate change by pumping hundreds of billions of dollars into extreme fossil fuels.
The seventh edition of an annual report, Shorting the Climate: Fossil Fuel Finance Report Card 2016 embarks on new territory to evaluate the bank policies and exposure of 25 U.S., European, and Canadian banks in extreme fossil fuels - the most carbon intensive, financially risky, and environmentally destructive sub-sectors. This includes coal mining, coal power, extreme oil (tar sands, Arctic oil, ultra-deep drilling) and North American liquefied natural gas export.
The report card, which also graded banks on their human rights policies, shows that banks performed poorly in all sectors. Levels of exposure were high across the board on the order of tens or hundreds of billions of finance for extreme fuel companies, demonstrating that banks are locking the world onto a path of major climate instability. Grades on policies were also poor, with an overall D average for the Report Card, showing that a vast majority of banks have no significant policies in place to stop funding extreme fossil fuels.
""In finance terms, ‘short-selling' or ‘shorting' is when an investor profits if a company or asset declines in value. It means betting on failure. After the Paris agreement, financing extreme fossil fuels amounts to shorting the climate. These bets are also at the expense of some of the most vulnerable communities living in fossil fuel ‘sacrifice zones' around the world. We need banks to move now to help pivot the economy away from extreme fossil fuels for the sake of the planet and its people,"" said Jason Opeña Disterhoft, Senior Campaigner with Rainforest Action Network.
Yann Louvel, BankTrack's Climate and Energy Campaign Coordinator, said, ""Many banks announced a move away from coal in the run up to COP21 and after, but most of these focused only on coal mining. Our assessment clearly shows that they still have a long way to go to concretely exit this industry, and even more for the other extreme fossil fuel sectors. None of these banks can claim to support the Paris Agreement, to be aligned with a 2° scenario or to be fighting climate change - as we too often read in their sustainability reports - if they continue to finance these destructive sectors.""
At a time when the world's nations have agreed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change, leading financial institutions have continued business as usual investment in fossil fuels in direct contradiction of global consensus.  In just the past three years, these banks have sunk $42 billion for companies active in coal mining; $154 billion for the 20 largest coal-fired power producers; $306 billion for companies that drill extreme oil; and $282 billion for companies building liquefied natural gas export infrastructure. If governments follow through on the Paris agreement and limit carbon emissions, these investments could likely result in stranded assets and significant losses.
The report card does reflect bank movement on coal mining, where ten of the biggest U.S. and European banks committed to reduce funding for the coal mining sector in the last year.  Based on their ability to quickly switch their stance on coal over the last year alone, banks are capable of making the critical choice to cut out extreme fossil fuel investments. Not only can they do it, it is a critical step to follow through on promises made in Paris to stabilize the climate.

International ",WWF calls for industry standards in the Green Bond market to bolster a sustainable economy,,,,,,"
New research commissioned by WWF and published today, shows that the proliferation of standards, frameworks and guidelines, as well as the diversity of market practices in terms of definitions and requirements for green bonds create complexity and confusion among issuers and investors which could hamper the confidence needed for the green bond market to thrive. Creating a large, liquid market in green bonds - including aggregating small projects - offers a unique opportunity to boost the volume of capital available, as well as reducing the cost of debt for projects that drive the transition towards a sustainable economy.  As countries seek proactive solutions to the environmental challenges that are faced, green bonds and their associated standards can play an integral role for both the finance and conservation communities. However lack of standards has led to the risk of ‘greenwashing', with not all green bonds fulfilling their green promise. Over the past couple of years several green bond issuances have been controversial among stakeholders. As investors and issuers pay more attention to environmental, social and governance issues, green standards can further influence the wider market. The research also finds that most frameworks and guidelines currently only look at the potential environmental impacts prior to issuing a bond, instead of assessing the actual environmental benefits of projects throughout the lifetime of the bond. Focussing on promised environmental impacts rather than actual performance raises the risk of greenwashing if bonds are issued and perceived as green, while only achieving minor or in fact no actual environmental benefits. Nicole Clucas, Sustainable Finance Specialist for WWF-UK commented: ""Green bonds are vital for the future of a sustainable economy, but not everything labelled ‘green' fulfils its promise. There must be robust standards to ensure that people get what they expect. Vigorous, credible, fully-developed and widely-accepted industry standards for green bonds are urgently needed to ensure that the market thrives and the sustainable economy grows. With the right level of commitment and collaboration among stakeholders, and guided by existing initiatives such as the Green Bond Principles and the Climate Bonds Initiative, it is possible to define a set of widely-accepted standards, building on some of the existing ones while taking into account scientific evidence."" Pascal Canfin, CEO of WWF-France said: ""Only a bond for which the issuer can demonstrate measurable environmental benefits, certified by an independent party according to such widely-accepted, fully developed standards, should qualify as a green bond. Bonds which do not meet these standards could undermine the credibility of the entire green bond market.We recognise that increased transparency represents an additional effort for the issuer but we believe that this is a ‘cost' well worth incurring for the benefit of reduced risk. In a fully functioning market, such added value will be reflected in premiums and prices"".  - ends -  Notes to the editor  

WWF's report: Green Bonds must keep the green promise! can be found here.
Green bonds were created to fund projects that have positive environmental and/or climate benefits.
Greenwashing is the term used to describe the perception of a product as environmentally friendly when it is not.
WWF is one of the world's largest independent conservation organisations, with more than five million supporters and a global network active in more than one hundred countries. Through our engagement with the public, businesses and government, we focus on safeguarding the natural world, creating solutions to the most serious environmental issues facing our planet, so that people and nature thrive.  Find out more about our work, past and present atwwf.org.uk.
WWF is an observer member of the Green Bond Principles and contributes actively to technical working groups convened by Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI). While WWF is committed to supporting the development of standards for green bonds, WWF's participation in the Green Bond Principles and CBI may not be construed as an endorsement of principles, standards or the certification scheme currently purveyed by these two organisations.
WWF has no plans to develop a proprietary green bond label, to become a verifier or certifier of green bonds or to develop its own green bond standards. WWF will rather seek to work with partners and existing platforms, in particular the Green Bond Principles and CBI, to support and promote the development of such standards through multi-stakeholder dialogue.

Nijmegen, the Netherlands ",NTPC shareholders urged to push for Rampal coal plant to be dropped,,,Rampal coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Bangladesh,"
BankTrack this week sent letters to all major shareholders of the Indian National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) appealing to them to use their influence to urge the company to withdraw from the highly destructive Rampal coal power plant in Bangladesh. The plant threatens the world's largest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans.


NTPC, which is majority-owned by the Indian state, is building the plant together with the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), forming a joint venture called the Bangladesh-India Friendship Power Company (BIFPCL).


The 1,320 megawatt Rampal coal power plant is situated just 14 kilometers away from the world-renowned Sundarbans forest, a recognized UNESCO World Heritage site that is not only home to unique animal species such as the Bengal tiger and the Irrawaddy and Ganges dolphin, but which also provides livelihoods to hundreds of thousands of people living in and around the wetland area. The coal plant would also emit more than 7.9 million tons of CO2 annually for 25 years, taking a heavy toll on the climate.


The plant is already under construction and instances of human right violations as well as corruption have been observed. In addition, building a power plant this close to an ecologically sensitive area would be illegal if the plant were to be built in India.


All these issues have stirred ongoing local and national opposition to the project, with growing international support. The appeal to NTPC shareholders comes in addition to a global coalition of 131 civil society groups and over 60,000 individuals calling on the Export-Import Bank of India to abandon its financing plans for the construction of the Rampal coal power plant.


Catalina von Hildebrand, Climate and Energy Campaigner at BankTrack, commented: ""This project makes a mockery of NTPCs sustainability ambitions and commitments as it will bring huge biodiversity loss and harm to the unique biosphere of the Sundarbans. But there is still time to put a stop to it. It is in the interest of the shareholders of NTPC to persuade NTCP that a project as destructive as Rampal should have no place in the power portfolio of NTPC.""

Nijmegen, The Netherlands ",BankTrack condemns Japanese and Singapore bank financing of Batang coal project in Indonesia as reckless to people and climate,DBS ,Singapore,Batang Coal Power Project ,energy plants - coal,Indonesia,"

BankTrack today strongly criticised the announced support of the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and a number of Japanese and Singapore banks for the Batang coal power plant project in Indonesia, calling it ‘a reckless move against people and climate'.  JBIC's approval of a USD 3.4 billion loan agreement for the 2,000 MW project, joined by a string of commercial banks including Mizuho, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, comes after five years of delays due to local opposition from farmers and fishermen in Batang .
The Batang project has raised major human rights concerns, as a result of the AMDAL process (Indonesia's version of the environmental impact assessment) ignoring strenuous local community resistance. More than 7,000 villagers had expressed concern about the proposed power plant, hundreds of local people have protested against the project in Jakarta. Some have refused to sell their land needed for the plant while in 2013 violent reprisals from local authorities and the military resulted in injuries to protestors.
Local people are also deeply concerned about the plant's impact on their livelihood and health. Many Batang farmers and fishermen protested to denounce that the project will destroy fertile agricultural land and pollute local coastal areas where more than 10,000 fishers earn their living . A Greenpeace report issued in 2014, ‘The Human Cost of Coal', revealed that the toxic air emissions from the Batang plant would lead to the deaths of 800 people per year, or approximately 30,000 people over its expected operating life .
Community and health issues aside, Batang will also be one of the biggest coal-fired power plants in Asia and is expected to emit 10.8 million tonnes of CO2 per year from 2020 on, when it is planned to become operational. At the Paris climate summit last year, Indonesia pledged to reduce its emissions by 29% by 2030, yet if coal fired power plants continue to be built as planned, Indonesia's energy sector emissions could instead increase dramatically.
Yann Louvel, Climate and Energy Campaign Coordinator at BankTrack, commented:
""We strongly condemn the financing of the Batang project by Japanese and Singapore based banks. Their financing is completely at odds with their lofty commitments to promote human rights and help realise sustainable societies. The banks should have instead financed the development of Indonesia's huge renewable energy potential if they are in any way serious about achieving these goals, as we have been pointing out to them since 2014.""
Johan Frijns, BankTrack's director, concluded:
‘‘It is shocking to see Mizuho, Sumitomo Mitsui and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ involved in financing this project. All three Japanese banks have adopted the Equator Principles, an investment standard supposed to prevent large, negative social and environmental impacts when financing projects, with Mizuho even the former chair of the Equator Principles Association. If such standards do not prevent adopting banks from putting their money into a project as blatantly destructive as Batang, what good are they? The very credibility of the Equator Principles as effectively helping to prevent climate change and human rights violations is at stake here.''
Notes for editors : 
 See the JBIC announcement on this page.
 The full list of banks involved includes Japanese banks Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizuho Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation, Shinsei Bank and Norinchukin Bank, and two Singapore based banks, DBS Bank and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation.
 On  September 23, 2014, 87 Batang farmers took action by unfurling a message proclaiming ""Food Not Coal,"" to oppose the construction of the plant in Ponowareng village. The banner, measuring 50 meters a side, was a reminder to the government to protect the community's productive agriculture and to highlight that their area was threatened by the development of the power plant. The following day, on September 24, 2014, fishermen used 48 boats to spell out ""Tolak PLTU"" (""No to Coal Power Plant"") on the waters of the Ujung Negoro-Roban River to express their concerns that the proposed plant would threaten Batang's generations-old practice of rod-fishing, a critical source of livelihood for the fishermen on the north coast of Java.

",Environmental Paper Network and BankTrack publish minimum requirements for financiers of pulp and paper industry projects,,,,,,"
The Environmental Paper Network (EPN), and BankTrack today published Green Paper, Red Lines, a brief document setting out minimum requirements ('red lines') for the pulp and paper industry to avoid harm to people and the environment. EPN and BankTrack urge banks and investors who consider financing pulp and paper companies to use the checklist to assess whether these companies are on the right side of these 'red lines', and steer clear if they are not.

 

The requirements cover a wide range of regulatory, social, environmental and corporate issues, from land and indigenous peoples' rights to corruption and tax avoidance to technical standards for paper mills and peatland protection. Unless pulp and paper companies fulfil these requirements, unacceptable social and environmental harm is likely to be associated with their pulp and paper mills. Companies that achieve these standards are not automatically deemed to be operating in a sustainable manner. However, if companies cross these red lines they, as well as their financiers, are highly likely to be targeted by civil society campaigns.

 

Mandy Haggith, co-ordinator of the Environmental Paper Network's pulp finance working group, said, ""We want banks and other investors to be our allies in helping to transform the pulp and paper industry towards our Global Paper Vision, by focusing finance only where the industry is sustainable. We hope these red lines will be used by banks and investors to identify projects and companies that should be exempt from finance because of their large negative environmental and social impacts, thus also avoiding severe reputational risk for the banks and investors themselves""

 

Karen Vermeer, forest campaigner at BankTrack, said: ""The Red Lines document is a benchmark for us to assess the robustness of forest related investment policies of private sector banks. Solid and stringent investment criteria will go a long way in avoiding harm associated with pulp and paper projects, which is also in the best business interest of banks"".

Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic ",European banks warned over raid on pension funds to finance disputed coal plant in Dominican Republic,Banco Santander ,Spain,Punta Catalina-Hatillo coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Dominican Republic,"
Top European banks including Société Générale, Deutsche Bank and ING have been warned by Dominican Republic NGO the National Committee to Combat Climate Change (CNLCC) about the worrying implications of Dominican government plans to use $600 million of employee pension fund money in order to help finance the controversial - and struggling - $2 billion Punta Catalina coal power plant project, currently under construction on the Caribbean island. 
The Dominican government has been forced to initiate the pension fund move owing to the inability of the Brazilian National Development Bank (BNDES) to disburse essential co-financing for the project, a result of ongoing corruption investigations in Brazil into Odebrecht, the company awarded the Punta Catalina construction contract in what campaigners believe to be dubious circumstances.
CNLCC believes that the use of pension funds to finance the construction of the Punta Catalina coal plant is an unacceptable and potentially jeopardising use of public funds for a project originally set up to be financed without any public money involvement. CNLCC also claims that the project would result in significant pollution and carbon emissions, endangering public health and the environment as well as fuelling climate change.
The proposed Punta Catalina project comprises two identical coal-fired units each with 385 megawatt capacity, and the construction of a coal terminal with a capacity of 80,000 tonnes. Project finance for the coal plant was agreed with Société Générale, Deutsche Bank, ING, Santander, UniCredit last summer, alongside a loan guarantee from SACE, Italy's export credit agency. 
A first $200 million tranche, out of a planned total of $632.5 million, was disbursed by the European banks at the end of last year. Further disbursement of construction finance from the banks, according to a contract agreement seen by campaign groups, was supposed to have been contingent on the release of co-financing from BNDES, previously scheduled for April this year.
CNLCC is also concerned about the potential use of state pension fund money for a project which would contravene part of the Dominican Republic's National Development Strategy of 2012 which stipulates the promotion of ""decarbonization of the national economy through the use of renewable energy sources, the market development of biofuels, energy efficiency and efficient and clean transportation.""
Enrique de León of CNLCC commented: 
""With the abundance of renewable energy potential which the Dominican Republic possesses, it's been very surprising to see a string of European banks, which all say they are committed to the clean energy transition and fighting climate change, getting behind a project which will require major coal imports to the island, and will lead to considerable environmental and health impacts if the Punta Catalina plant starts firing.
""Now the Dominican government is concocting a scheme, forced upon it because of all kinds of serious irregularities hanging over the project, which it hopes will further lure in the European banks. Such antics would not be tolerated in the countries where these banks are based, and we call on the banks to put principles and the climate before profit and corruption.""
Yann Louvel, Climate and energy coordinator at BankTrack, said: 
""There is clearly a lot more to the Punta Catalina coal project than meets the eye. Climate considerations don't seem to have deterred some of Europe's top banks from having a punt on Punta Catalina. Now, in what is becoming an increasingly murky deal, $600 million of state pension fund money is being lined up to keep the banks involved in the deal. These institutions need to adopt a strong, no tolerance approach to these proposed shabby financing arrangements, for what is an already very shabby, highly questionable coal investment.""

Paris ","COAL: BNP Paribas misses its shot, the match begins!",BNP Paribas ,France,,,,"
When asked today at its General Assembly about its support for 
coal, French bank BNP Paribas was content to simply recall the 
commitments it adopted for last year's United Nations climate summit 
(COP21), and leave it at that. According to Friends of the Earth France,
 however, the policies adopted by the bank contain a number of loopholes
 which still allow the bank to finance companies in the coal sector, a 
situation wholly inconsistent with BNP Paribas's stated priority to ""act
 against climate change."" In light of this denial of the climate 
emergency, Friends of the Earth France has announced a new wave of 
mobilisation against BNP Paribas and Engie, the French power company and
 another major climate polluter.  At today's General Assembly Friends of the Earth France called on BNP 
Paribas to commit to no longer finance the development of the coal 
sector. However the sponsor of the French Tennis Open at Roland Garros 
and the world's fourth largest coal financier was content to recall its 
commitments made at the COP21 last year. This stance amounted to an 
unacceptable denial of reality for Friends of the Earth France which 
denounced the double standards of a bank that continues to finance coal 
despite committing to do everything to achieve the goals of the Paris 
Agreement and to align its financing with the 2°C scenario .  Lucie Pinson, Private Finance campaigner at Friends of the Earth France, said: ""Coal is incompatible with the climate emergency. How many reports 
demonstrating this simple fact will it take for BNP Paribas to end its 
financing of new coal plants or of businesses that have no strategy to 
align their activities with the 1.5°C scenario? The COP21 may be past 
but we will not allow the objectives of the Paris Agreement to be 
forgotten. There is a match under way today, featuring the climate 
against profits and we are ready to mobilize as BNP Paribas has not 
sufficiently revised its financing policies to respond to the climate 
emergency.""  In a note published today, Friends of the Earth France revealed six 
flaws in BNP Paribas's coal policies . Despite the bank's 2015 review
 of its climate commitments climate, they cover only a small part of the
 coal sector:

BNP Paribas is reducing support for coal mining companies and power 
producers, yet is ignoring other key players in the industry - including
 transporters, traders and suppliers.
BNP Paribas continues to deem it unneccesary to end financial support
 for EDF, Engie and any other business which produces less than 30% of 
its electricity from coal.
BNP Paribas is requiring some of its customers to diversify out of 
coal without specifying the requirement that such an exit from coal 
should align with the 1.5°C scenario.
Not a single mention is made of exiting coal itself; BNP Paribas is 
therefore assisting with the resale of coal assets instead of demanding 
their closure.
No demands are made of the world's biggest coal producers such as Glencore, Anglo American and BHP Billiton.

 In line with mass civil disobedience actions organised to prevent 
policymakers and companies acting with impunity, Friends of the Earth 
France has announced a new mobilisation programme on the occasion of the
 French Tennis Open being staged in Paris and sponsored by BNP Paribas. On June 4 a ‘Climate versus profits' tennis match will be held between climate polluters and civil society .  Notes for editors

Nijmegen ",New BankTrack Human Rights Impact Briefing: Drummond and paramilitary violence in Colombia,Bank of America ,United States,Drummond ,mining - coal ,United States,"
BankTrack today publishes the second in its series of Human Rights Impact Briefings, focusing on the coal company Drummond and the seven banks which have financed it since 2010. The briefing finds that despite allegations of their client's involvement in serious human rights violations only two of these seven banks were able to disclose any action taken in response.The series of briefings intends to shed light on the extent to which banks are living up to their responsibilities under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, by examining specific human rights impacts linked to their finance. The series pushes for banks to account publicly for how they manage these impacts by publishing and comparing their responses .Drummond produces the majority of its coal in the Cesar mining region of Colombia, an area in which paramilitary violence has had profound impacts for the local population. Conservative estimates suggest paramilitaries drove over 55,000 farmers from their land and killed at least 3,100 people in the period from 1996 to 2006, with the intention of defending the interests and properties of the local economic elite against guerrilla activities.The Dutch peace movement PAX has investigated reports of links between this violence and mining companies operating in the area, including Drummond. Legal testimonies examined by PAX indicate that Drummond and other mining companies supported the paramilitaries in several ways, including requesting their establishment and financing them - allegations Drummond strongly denies. However the company has to date resisted any involvement in supporting the victims of violence in their efforts to secure remedy for the gross human rights violations they have suffered.BankTrack presented the seven banks that had provided loans to Drummond since 2010 with details of these allegations. Under the UN Guiding Principles, businesses have a responsibility to perform human rights due diligence to prevent or mitigate human rights impacts linked to their services, and to report on how they address these impacts, particularly when concerns are raised on behalf of those affected.Only two banks - Citigroup and BNP Paribas - responded with details of how they had sought to address these impacts. In a welcome move, BNP Paribas responded that it has suspended finance with Drummond for environmental and human rights reasons. Citigroup reported that it has engaged with Drummond on issues including security and human rights, but its response indicates it is satisfied that human rights are well-managed at the company.Bank of America, BBVA, HSBC, Mizuho Financial and Wells Fargo did not disclose any  response to the issues identified, and showed no evidence that they are meeting the requirements of the UN Guiding Principles in this case. With the exception of BBVA, the banks stated that as a general policy they do not, or cannot, comment on their links to specific companies they finance.Ryan Brightwell, BankTrack's Human Rights Campaign Coordinator, commented, ""In saying they will not comment on specific clients, Bank of America, HSBC, Mizuho Financial and Wells Fargo are in effect saying they cannot meet their responsibilities under the UN Guiding Principles. Yet other banks, often in the same legal jurisdictions, have shown that it is possible. ""Regardless of whether they are prepared to account for their actions publicly, we ask all banks who have financed Drummond to engage with the company, and make any further finance contingent on tangible steps to support a reconciliation process for the victims of violence surrounding their mines."" How banks responded

Response outlining some action taken in response to the issues raised: BNP Paribas; Citigroup
Confirmation of link with Drummond, but no comment on the specific issues raised: BBVA
No confirmation of link with Drummond, and no comment on the specific issues raised: Bank of America; HSBC; Mizuho Financial; Wells Fargo

",Deutsche Bank blacklists mountaintop removal companies,Deutsche Bank ,Germany,Mountain top removal coal mining ,mining - coal ,United States,"

At Deutsche Bank's shareholder meeting last week, the bank announced
an end to its support for mountaintop removal mining. In his speech, the bank's
outgoing CEO, Juergen Fitschen, said: ""Using explosives to destroy the summits
of mountains does not seem to us to be a legitimate or ecologically sensible
manner of surface mining. For this reason, we will no longer finance companies
who are significantly involved in this type of coal extraction.""
Heffa Schuecking, director of the German environment and human
rights NGO urgewald, comments: ""This
is a real break-through as Deutsche Bank has played a major role in financing
companies like Blackhawk Mining, the world's largest producer of mountaintop
removal coal. "" According to Schuecking, most major European banks have now
adopted policies that exclude the top producers of coal extracted through
mountaintop removal.
""In view of the extreme impacts of mountaintop removal mining on
Appalachia's communities and environment, it is time to exclude not only the
top producers, but all companies that use this brutal mining method,"" says
Amanda Starbuck of Rainforest Action
Network.
""Current policies often use a threshold based on what banks
term  ‘significant' coal production,""
explains Paul Corbit Brown from the Appalachian NGO Keeper of the Mountains. ""But all of our mountains are significant
and it shouldn't make a whit of difference whether they are blown up for
500,000 or 1 million tons of coal. Banks need to blacklist all companies that
practice this egregious form of mining.""
""Any bank that now continues financing mountaintop removal companies
is positioning itself to become the prime target of NGO campaigns,"" adds Yann
Louvel of BankTrack.

",Indonesia: The climate test for Crédit Agricole and Société Générale,Crédit Agricole ,France,Tanjung Jati-B 2 (TJB2) coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Indonesia,"
Will Société Générale and Crédit Agricole finance the proposed expansion of the Tanjung Jati B coal power plant in Indonesia or will they withdraw from the project as BNP Paribas has already done? A paper published this week by Friends of the Earth France and Greenpeace Indonesia reveals that French banks are not applying the same rigour to the climate commitments which they adopted for the COP21 in Paris last year. The credibility of Société Générale and Crédit Agricole is on the line at their respective general meetings this week.


Five months have passed since the adoption of the Paris Agreement yet Crédit Agricole and Société Générale have still not cleaned up their portfolios. The two banks remain engaged in the construction of the expansion of the Tanjung Jati B coal power plant in Indonesia (the TJB2 project), while BNP Paribas has withdrawn from the project.  This is the finding of a paper published this week by Friends of the Earth France and Greenpeace: ‘Indonesia: The climate test for Crédit Agricole and Société Générale.' 

Lucie Pinson, Private finance campaigner at Friends of the Earth France, said:

""We are witnessing incredible hypocrisy from the banks. On the one hand Crédit Agricole and Société Générale are committed to implementing the Paris Agreement and to aligning their activities with the 2°C trajectory. On the other, they reckon that they can just keep on financing new coal plants. It may not have a particularly impressive climate policy, but at least BNP Paribas has realised that nothing justifies project finance for Tanjung Jati B in Indonesia."" 

According to Bondan Andriyanu from Greenpeace Indonesia:

""Indonesia is not trying to build an ultra-supercritical power plant to replace power plants with high emissions. The country's new energy plan calls for 100 new coal plants by 2019. This plan would not only more than double the country's emissions over 25 years, but it would cause the premature deaths of 28,300 people a year. Nothing has been cancelled since COP21, as if the government had never even promised at Paris to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 29% by 2030.""

Hindun Mulaika of Greenpeace Indonesia commented:

""Crédit Agricole and Société Générale can not justify their support for coal on behalf of the development of southern countries such as Indonesia. The TJB2 project flies in the face of the needs and the best interests of the people. Roughly 5000 people mobilised in Jakarta last week to claim our right to a safe future and to demand the end of coal. Indonesia has huge potential in renewable energy and developing this to meet the needs of the population would cost a tenth of what's been spent on fossil fuel subsidies over the past 10 years."" 


It's not too late for Crédit Agricole and Société Générale. If both banks are committed to their customer Sumitomo, the funding is not yet concluded, and there is still time to follow the example of BNP Paribas and to withdraw from the project.

Attending both banks' general assemblies on Wednesday and Thursday this week, Friends of the Earth France will also publicly ask the banks to stop all funding for coal projects and to stop providing finance for companies which continue to develop this climate-killing sector.

Notes for editors:

1. An article published in Project Finance International in January 2016 states that ""two French banks - Crédit Agricole and Société Générale - have joined the group behind the banks financing the expansion of the coal plant Tanjung Jati B (TJB2) following the withdrawal of BNP Paribas.""

2. The paper (in French) is available at the bottom of this page.

3. Crédit Agricole committed in September 2015 to stop funding coal power projects in high-income countries in line with World Bank guidelines and Société Générale announced two months later the end of its support for such projects in OECD high income countries. According to the Global Coal Plant Tracker database, 6.5% and 4.1% of coal power projects planned since 2010 are located in these countries.

4. The mobilisations took place as part of the BreakFree protests, a wave of citizen actions fighting against the extraction of fossil fuels, starting with coal. In March this year Indonesia's Minister of Energy and mineral resources pointed out the country's renewable energy potential, see this page.

Las Vegas ",Report raises serious human rights concerns about working conditions at Station Casinos,,,,,,"
On May 17, 2016, Professor Fatma Marouf, Co-Director of the Immigration Clinic at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, William S. Boyd School of Law, produced with co-authors Sameer Ashar, Clinical Professor of Law and Co-Director of the Immigrants' Rights Clinic at U.C. Irvine Law School and Jennifer Rosenbaum, Robina Foundation Human Rights Fellow at Yale Law School, released a report titled ""Banking on Unsafe Working Conditions: Placing Profits Before Protection of Casino & Hotel Workers' Human Rights in Deutsche Bank's U.S. Supply Chain.""The report, based on interviews with 101 employees of Station Casinos, raises serious human rights concerns related primarily to health and safety, including inadequate safety gear and precautions, preventable workplace injuries, inadequate protection from abuse by customers, severe mental stress, environmental hazards, and inability to take breaks. In addition, workers reported lack of job security, inadequate health insurance, excessive work without overtime pay, discouragement of freedom of association and collective bargaining, and not being treated with dignity and respect.Examples of human rights abuses reported by the workers:

Housekeepers reported being forced to clean up bodily fluids without proper chemicals or training;
Workers reported numerous on-the-job injuries, including cuts, burns, eye infections, torn ligaments, twisted ankles, fractures, broken bones, and slip-and-falls;
Workers described defective machinery, such as leaking dishwashers, broken steamers, and broken carts that reportedly resulted in some of the injuries mentioned above;
Workers reported feeling afraid to inform management about injuries and unsafe conditions, or to call in sick because they feared being disciplined for doing so;
Housekeepers spoke of being abused by guests and experiencing either negative repercussions, or no assistance from management, or feeling afraid to report such incidents;
Workers reported excessive workloads and extreme stress due to understaffing;
Workers reported infestations, inadequate cleaning supplies, and inadequate time to clean properly;
Workers reported being forced to skip their breaks and to work with a broken clock;
On-call workers reported lack of job security due to unpredictable hours;
Workers reported being given more work than could reasonably be accomplished in a regular workday instead of being paid overtime;
Some workers who support the union reported being more closely scrutinized by management, or felt management was looking for excuses to discipline or fire them;

The report recommends that both Station Casinos/Red Rock Resorts Inc. and Deutsche Bank, a part owner of the company, investigate and address the alleged abuses. The report applies a human rights analysis because Deutsche Bank has committed itself to following human rights principles and to holding its business partners accountable for any adverse human rights impacts.

Nijmegen ",Civil society response on announcement European financiers to ‘seek to exit’ Agua Zarca project,FMO ,Netherlands,Agua Zarca hydro project ,energy plants - dams,Honduras,"
The undersigned civil society organisations welcome the decision by Dutch development bank FMO, and Finnish finance company Finnfund, to ""seek to exit"" the Agua Zarca hydroelectric project in Honduras.
In an announcement on May 9, both financiers stated that they took the decision after a court in Honduras decided on May 8 to press charges against four individuals in connection with the murder of Berta Cáceres. One of the suspects is the acting manager for social and environmental matters of the Honduran company DESA, the developer of the Agua Zarca project. FMO and FinnFund further announced that they will organize an ‘independent experts' mission to Honduras, taking place as soon as possible, that will ‘analyse how an exit could take place responsibly'.
Berta was murdered on March 2, 2016, after for years leading the struggle of COPINH (Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras) against the Agua Zarca project, situated along the Gualcarque River. The conflict around the project has resulted in many human rights violations and a number of killings, including earlier the 2013 murder of Tomas Garcia.
Over the last few years COPINH has repeatedly contacted FMO, insisting that they should not fund the Agua Zarca project, as the project sponsor had not obtained the required free, prior, informed consent of the indigenous Lenca people, and because land titles had not been properly obtained.
On March 16, 2016, following the news that Nelson Garcia, another member of COPINH, had been assassinated (despite the international spotlight being on Honduras following Berta's murder), both FMO and Finnfund (and subsequently CABEI, the third financier) announced that they would temporarily suspend all disbursements towards the Agua Zarca project.
Our organisations call upon all three financiers to now take immediate measures to formally and fully divest from the project.
Our organisations also call upon the financiers to ensure proper reparations are provided to the people who have been adversely affected by the project to date.
FMO, FinnFund and CABEI should also undertake profound procedural and policy reforms to ensure that their future investments will not result in further human and environmental rights violations.
Our organisations further reiterate our demand that an independent investigation takes place into the circumstances of Bertas' death, conducted by the Inter American Commission on Human Rights (IAHCR)
""FMO has confirmed to COPINH that they decided to withdraw from the Agua Zarca Project. COPINH is relieved that at last FMO has made this decision and thinks it should be carried out immediately. The threats against the Lenca people who oppose the Agua Zarca Project continue today.  The lives lost can never be returned.  FMO and FinnFund bear responsibility for the violence and grave violations of the rights of the Lenca people as a result of the Agua Zarca project and in addition to withdrawing must take serious action to remedy the harm done. COPINH hopes that FMO's and Finnfunds mission to Honduras will focus on this latter aspect and will not cause any further delay in deciding to withdraw"" states Jose Asunción Martinez of COPINH.
Gustavo Castro Soto, director of Friends of the Earth Mexico (Otros Mundos), who was injured during the attack in which Berta was murdered, said: ""Finnfund and FMO are partly responsible for the violence and the murder of Berta Cáceres. Financing the project Agua Zarca helped prompt continued threats to and repression of COPINH. They provided funding without consulting the Lenca indigenous peoples, violating their human rights. They have to end their involvement in the project Agua Zarca, of course. But they also should ensure they do not make the same mistake again with other projects.""

",International coalition issues urgent appeal to save Bangladesh´s people and tigers from coal,Export-Import Bank of  (Exim Bank) ,India,Rampal coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Bangladesh,"
A global coalition including BankTrack, Greenpeace International, Rainforest Action Network, and Indian and Bangladeshi civil society groups today issued an urgent appeal to the Export-Import Bank of India to abandon its plans to finance the construction of the Rampal coal power plant in Bangladesh and save the world-renowned Sundarbans wetlands from destruction.

 

The open letter calls on Exim Bank of India to live up to its own promise to ‘recognize its obligations as a citizen of the world' that acts ‘with due regard to public interest', and therefore not to support the destructive Rampal coal plant.

 

The Exim Bank of India currently intends to provide a USD 1.6 billion loan to the sponsor of the project, the Bangladesh-India Friendship Power Company Ltd, a joint venture between the Indian and Bangladeshi state-owned electricity providers (the National Thermal Power Corporation, NTPC, and the Bangladesh Power Division Board, BPDB, respectively). The bank is rumoured to be taking a final decision on the loan by July 2016.

 

The 1,320 megawatt Rampal power plant, already under construction, is located just 14 kilometres from the edge of the Sundarbans Reserve Forest, a UNESCO World Heritage area and a Ramsar wetlands site. Critics of the project point out the potential for widespread contamination of the extraordinarily rich ecosystem of the Sundarbans, which would risk wiping out the endangered Bengal tigers, of which only around 100 individuals remain in the forest, as well as affecting numerous other species. Over two million people living in and around the Sundarbans ecosystem also find their livelihoods threatened by the project. The coal plant would emit more than 7.9 million tons of CO2 annually for 25 years, taking a heavy toll on the climate.

 

Exim Bank of India is considering financing the project despite the fact that its location means it would not meet environmental standards for large power plants in India. Indian Environment Ministry rules state that coal power plants should not be constructed within 25 kilometres of the outer periphery of national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and other ecologically sensitive areas such as tropical forests and biosphere reserves.

 

Soumya Dutta of the Indian People's Science Campaign, Bharat Jan Vigyan Jatha, said: ""This plan shows the Indian government and state-owned NTPC to be violating their own norms and basically committing a huge crime against the people and the ecosystem of the Sundarbans. If the Export-Import Bank of India proceeds with this extremely large loan, it will be an accomplice to this crime. This single coal power plant will boost Bangladesh's total CO2 emissions by roughly 15%, and this in a nation that has a great potential to develop renewable energy sources"".

 

Sharif Jamil, founding member of National Committee for Saving the Sundarbans (NCSS) and Joint Secretary of BAPA (Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon), a coalition of Bangladeshi environmental organisations, expressed his concerns on the climate impact of the project: ""It is shocking to hear Bangladeshi officials say coal is clean while most of the rest of the world has identified coal as a dirty fuel and is in the process of shutting down coal plants. It is frustrating when India promotes renewable energy for both economic and social development domestically but is intent on bringing coal-based industries from India, threatening our lives and unique nature. I have seen recently that thousands of people in the fishermen community, dependent on the Passur River, are worried about their livelihood.""

 

Catalina von Hildebrand, climate and energy campaigner at BankTrack, said: ""If Exim Bank of India is serious about being a responsible citizen of the world, it will not finance a project which would wreak havoc on both local communities and the world's climate. Coal plants such as Rampal are a thing of the past. India Exim should start positioning itself as an institution that lends for the future and thus abandon its plans to finance the Rampal coal plant.""

 

BankTrack is inviting concerned organisations from around the world to join the Global Call on Exim Bank of India requesting that the bank declines to finance Rampal in order to help reduce harmful impacts on the Sundarbans.

Jakarta, Indonesia ",International coalition calls for emergency sanctions against Indonesian forest fire culprits,,,,,,"
A broad international coalition of over 70 civil society organizations, including Transformasi untuk Keadilan Indonesia (TuK INDONESIA), Walhi (Friends of the Earth Indonesia), Rainforest Action Network, the Sierra Club and BankTrack is calling on financial regulators in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Japan, China, Europe and the United States to apply emergency sanctions on major commercial banks, in an effort to cut funding from companies identified as causing the forest fire crisis that annually chokes much of Southeast Asia. A joint letter will be sent to over 50 international organisations, including to some of the world's top bank CEOs and financial services regulators.
The region is bracing itself for a repeat of the 2015 haze crisis when wildfires, intentionally set to cheaply clear land for pulp, paper and palm oil production, blazed out of control and blanketed Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia with a toxic cover of smoke. The haze crisis caused regional evacuations, school and airport closures, hundreds of thousands of cases of respiratory disease and was responsible for at least 19 reported deaths. The smoke from the 2015 fire season was the worst on record and, at the peak of the disaster, released more global greenhouse gas emissions each day than the daily average of the US. By all accounts an environmental and human disaster, the 2015 fire season only ended with the arrival of Indonesia's rainy season.
""This is a horrific, man-made disaster that begins again each year like clockwork,"" said Tom Picken, a spokesperson for Rainforest Action Network (RAN).
""Big banks are providing much of the capital to fuel the industrial expansion causing this preventable fire crisis. Banks should not be supporting companies that violate anti-fire laws, but they do. Financial regulators must step in and enforce adequate controls and safeguards on these institutions enabling, and profiting from, the harmful and illegal actions of clients,"" said Picken.
As stated in the joint letter, there were 413 producing companies of tropical forest-risk commodities (such as palm oil, pulp and paper, timber and rubber) linked to burning in 2015. These companies received financial services and investment from more than 20 commercial banks, estimated to be in excess of US $17 billion since 2009.
Currently, new fire incidents are being reported in Indonesia and Malaysia as the 2016 burning season begins.

Amsterdam ",Revealed: ING and Rabobank continue support for biggest Russian coal producer,ING ,Netherlands,SUEK ,mining - coal ,Russian Federation,"
Dutch NGOs involved in the Fair Finance Guide coalition have today 
criticised Dutch banks ING and Rabobank for their recent loans of 109 
million euros to SUEK, the biggest Russian coal producer and one of the 
world's biggest coal mining companies.   The SUEK loans from the Dutch banks were made, along with loans for 
similar amounts from eight other banks, in February this year. In 
November 2015 ING announced that it was reducing its exposure to coal 
companies, with immediate effect, while Rabobank prides itself as a 
leader in financing sustainable energy.   ING is today holding its Annual Shareholders Meeting in Amsterdam, and 
the Fair Finance Guide coalition is calling on ING's board to state 
clearly that the bank will no longer lend to coal producers and to 
increase its lending to renewable energy producers in order to combat 
climate change.   The NGO coalition believes that apart from refraining from lending to 
coal companies, ING and Rabobank need to be fully transparent about the 
carbon footprint of their lending portfolio. Financial institutions 
should now be contributing to global efforts to reduce climate change to
 the 1.5 degree celsius maximum.  Evert Hassink, spokesperson for Fair Finance Guide Netherlands, commented:   ""With this new loan ING is breaking its new policy to reduce coal 
investments and refrain from lending to companies which rely on coal and
 coal power for over 50% of their business. Research by Fair Finance 
Guide in 2015 has already revealed that ING invests eight times as much 
in fossil fuels as it does in renewable energy. This new loan suggests 
that ING is ignoring the Paris climate agreement and its own climate 
policy.""

London ",Stuart Gulliver ‘has blood on his hands’ as HSBC AGM shines light on human rights abuses,HSBC ,United Kingdom,Drummond ,mining - coal ,United States,"

HSBC has provided $5.4 billion financing for coal since 2010
This includes $232.5m for Drummond, the major mining company implicated in grave human rights violations in Colombia, including 3,100 murders and 55,000 displacements
New campaign sees 300 write to HSBC CEO Stuart Gulliver to demand the bank quits coal
Campaigners, activists and shareholders to grill the board on coal financing and tax policy

HSBC executives are expected to come under fire today for the bank's alleged complicity in human rights violations in Colombia, as a result of continued support for the coal mining industry.
Facing questions from investors and campaigners at the bank's annual general meeting, CEO Stuart Gulliver and other executives are expected to be criticised for continuing to fund controversial coal mining company Drummond, to the tune of $232.5m over the last six years. 
Drummond faces allegations of complicity in serious human rights abuses in Cesar, Colombia, including the murder of 3,100 people, and the displacement of over 55,000 farmers from their own land. 95% of Drummond's assets are in Colombia, so any financing they receive from HSBC necessarily supports their operations there. 
Speaking outside the AGM, Campaign Manager for Move Your Money, Fionn Travers-Smith, said:
""For as long as HSBC's addiction to coal continues to blind them to the human rights abuses this disastrous industry entails, Stuart Gulliver and other executives at the bank are complicit in Drummond's crimes, and have blood on their hands.
One major funder has already pulled out from financing Drummond's continued operations on due diligence grounds, citing concerns over these human rights abuses. HSBC can and must do the same.
The bank cannot continue to shirk its responsibilities under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and must cease funding Drummond and all other coal companies immediately.
Failure to do so not only calls into question the bank's due diligence policies, respect for inalienable human rights, and approach to the climate crisis, it also undermines the judgment of HSBC's board members and their ability to manage a compliant and law-abiding bank.""
HSBC are rewriting their Metals and Mining Sector Policy for the first time since 2007, which is expected to be circulated to external stakeholders in May. Campaigners are demanding that the bank respect their climate commitments, including those made at the Paris COP21 Climate Summit in December, by excluding all coal mining companies in this new policy. 300 letters have already been sent to Stuart Gulliver issuing this demand. 
The news comes at a difficult time for the bank, with shareholders also expected to criticise the bank's tax avoidance and evasion policies, as revealed by the Panama Papers and Swiss Leaks scandals.
Commenting on the developments, Yann Louvel, Climate and Energy Campaign Coordinator at BankTrack, said:
""11 international banks have already moved in the right direction on coal mining, but we're yet to see any progress from HSBC on this front.
HSBC must follow the lead of banks like Natixis and ING and stop financing coal projects and companies around the world - particularly when, as with Drummond, they are implicated in such horrific human rights abuses.
After so many years of silence, this new Mining Policy is an opportunity for HSBC to step up to the plate and prove that it is a forward-thinking and progressive bank. Any hesitation will lose them shareholder confidence, and expose them to the systemic risks associated with continued exposure to coal.""

",BankTrack launches 2015 Annual Report,,,,,,"
BankTrack today releases its Annual Report for 2015, detailing its work and achievements in tracking banks, campaigning and NGO support, over its first full year since converting from the secretariat of a network of organisations to an independent NGO in its own right.
""One year on, we remain convinced that relaunching as an independent organisation was a good move: the new BankTrack has been more energetic than ever before, pushing forward campaigns on issues from climate change to human rights to forest protection,"" said Johan Frijns, BankTrack's Director.
Seven highlights from 2015 are identified in the report.

The Paris Pledge to Quit Coal wins massive support: Our main campaign of 2015 was the ""Paris Pledge"" campaign for all banks to pledge, in time for the Paris climate summit, to phase out finance for the coal sector. 21 ethical banks got on board, showing the larger ‘coal banks' that it can be done, and 160 groups added their voices to the call.
Global banks start to take steps away from coal: While only smaller banks signed the Paris Pledge, across the sector there was the beginning of what we hope becomes a significant shift away from coal in the banking sector. We showed the state of progress in The Coal Test report.
APRIL committed to stop rainforest destruction: Santander and ABN AMRO, the two biggest European banks financing Indonesian pulp and paper giant APRIL, walked away from the company in Spring, following pressure from BankTrack and allies, including a major Greenpeace petition. In June APRIL caved to the pressure and called an immediate end to logging in natural forests.
Bank human rights failures were debated at the UN: The UN cited BankTrack research when it decided to debate the issue of the finance sector's responsibility to remedy human rights impacts at the UN Forum for Business and Human Rights in Geneva. Panellists all agreed on the need for greater progress from the finance sector as a whole.
Four banks pull back from Mountaintop Removal: PNC, Barclays, Natixis and ING all announced new commitments to stop finance for destroying mountains for coal in 2015, adding to a growing roster of banks that refuse to support this hugely destructive industry.
More banks commit to steer clear of Australian ""carbon bomb"": Standard Chartered and Commonwealth Bank became the latest banks to withdraw from their roles in the Carmichael coal mine project in Australia's as-yet-unexploited Galilee Basin,  one of the world's largest ""carbon bomb"" projects, and the three largest French banks went even further, committing to not finance any coal projects in the Galilee Basin region.
BankTrack covered in The Economist, Nature and WIRED: Our work was featured in some big-hitting publications in 2015: the journal Nature Climate Change compared BankTrack data on coal finance with green bond issuances; we appeared in The Economist drawing attention to bank support for coal; and tech magazine WIRED talked about our work as an example of public shaming making the world a better place.

Washington D.C. ","NEW REPORT: Nearly $1 trillion wasted globally on extraneous coal projects, amount could end world energy poverty",,,,,,"
Today, the Sierra Club, Greenpeace, and CoalSwarm released Boom and Bust 2016: Tracking The Global Coal Plant Pipeline, the second annual report examining the precarious global coal plant pipeline. New investigations detailed in the report revealed that while the coal industry continues to push for the construction of more coal-fired power plants, in reality, coal plants are increasingly sitting idle in all of the world's four largest markets, and global coal consumption is declining drastically. This is particularly evident in China where the government recently took the first step to curb runaway coal plant investment, after the country's coal use plunged by nearly 6.4 percent in two years.


The report's unprecedentedly detailed mapping of new coal-fired power plants indicates the reported suspension of new permits and new construction starting in half of China's provinces could affect 60 percent of the 460 new coal-fired units that have been permitted or are in the permitting process.


With coal use on the decline worldwide, the estimated $981 billion needed to construct the proposed coal plant pipeline represents a massive investment in potentially stranded assets - resulting in an even further downward spiral for the global coal industry. In fact, this number is more than one-and-a-half times the amount that the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates is needed to end energy poverty for the 1.2 billion people currently living without reliable energy access. On top of this staggering revelation, the report found that the additional new proposed coal capacity would result in over 130,000 more premature deaths worldwide each year from air pollution and finds that existing coal-fired power plants are responsible for a total of nearly one million premature deaths annually from coal-fired power generation.


""The era of Big Coal is clearly coming to an end, and it's long past time to move beyond dangerous, outdated, and polluting energy sources toward an economy powered by clean, renewable sources of energy like solar and wind,"" said Nicole Ghio, senior campaigner for the Sierra Club's International Climate and Energy campaign. ""Coal use keeps falling off a cliff and plants are sitting idle, yet more money is being wasted on misguided attempts at locking in this dirty, dangerous fuel. The hundreds of billions being thrown at coal could instead go toward the booming clean energy sector, helping more than a billion people get access to the clean, reliable electricity that fossil fuels have failed to deliver.""


""Although this research has revealed hundreds of billions being squandered on unneeded coal plants, there's more at stake here than money,"" said Ted Nace, director of CoalSwarm. ""In terms of climate safety, the clock is ticking on the transition to clean energy. There is no time to waste.""


""As coal-fired power plants are rapidly becoming uncompetitive, and concerns about their massive health impacts grow, the coal industry is making a last-ditch push,"" said Lauri Myllyvirta, senior global campaigner on Coal and Air Pollution at Greenpeace. ""China alone is housing the largest power market investment bubble the world has ever seen. Even after announcing suspension of new permits in 13 provinces, the country could still bring over 500 new coal-fired power plant units online while power generation from coal is falling precipitously on clean energy growth and slower power demand.""

Paris ",Coal: a fraud still being supported by Crédit Agricole and Société Générale,Crédit Agricole ,France,Tanjung Jati-B 2 (TJB2) coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Indonesia,"
On the occasion of the publication of the ‘Boom and Bust 2016' report from Greenpeace, Sierra Club and CoalSwarm , which assesses coal power projects around the world, Friends of the Earth France and Greenpeace called on Crédit Agricole and Société Générale to renounce the Tanjung Jati B power plant expansion project in Indonesia .
The world has not acknowledged the Paris Agreement and the international target to limit the rise of the global temperature well below the threshold of 2°C, and to move towards a target of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Indeed, even as any new plant built today goes against this goal, regardless of the technology used, the new ‘Boom and Bust 2016' report from Greenpeace, Sierra Club and CoalSwarm shows that in fact thousands of coal projects are still being planned, in spite of their economic, health and even energy-providing shortcomings.
Lucie Pinson, Private finance / Coface campaigner at Friends of the Earth France, commented:

""There is overcapacity and every new coal power plant only increases the risk of ‘stranded assets'. We know how to bring cleaner, lower cost energy to those still lacking such in many countries, and the environmental and health damage from coal is catastrophic, with thousands of premature deaths resulting from each new, additional piece of infrastructure. Yet thousands of coal plant projects still exist and could be built with funding from French banks which have pledged to stop financing power plants mostly in rich countries.""  
In Indonesia, Crédit Agricole and Société Générale are part of a group of banks interested in financing the construction of two additional 1,000 MW units at the Tanjung Jati B (TJB2) coal plant . This project is part of the development plan of 100 new coal plants in Indonesia (5), a program likely to guarantee less energy to people who need it while guaranteeing returns for the mining industry hit by declining demand on international markets. Located on the island of Java, one of the most populated areas of Indonesia, and away from islands where power cuts are rampant, the project could double the number of premature deaths caused by the four existing units.
Lucie Pinson said: 

""While BNP Paribas has withdrawn from the project (6), Crédit Agricole and Société Générale could be set to finance the future extension of a plant that already costs the lives of 1,020 people every year. We have clearly now reached the limit of the climate commitments adopted at the recent COP21. If banks have to phase out their general support to the coal sector, they should no longer directly support new coal projects, as Natixis and ING are already committed to doing. These kind of new projects only undermine efforts elsewhere, especially when clean alternatives exist."" 
With an open letter, Friends of the Earth France, BankTrack and Greenpeace have called on Crédit Agricole and Société Générale to immediately withdraw from the proposed Tanjung Jati B project.

San Fransisco, the Hague ",FMO and Finnfund suspend support for Agua Zarca Dam,FMO ,Netherlands,Agua Zarca hydro project ,energy plants - dams,Honduras,"
On March 15, Nelson Garcia, an activist of COPINH, the Honduran organization Berta Cáceres had founded, was shot and killed when he helped a group of poor families resist a land grab in the small town of Rio Lindo. The brazen murder was not directly related to the conflict around the Agua Zarca Dam, but it showed that even under the international spotlight, powerful circles in Honduras have no respect for the lives of people who stand in the way of their economic interests.                              
In response to this ""shocking news,"" FMO, the Dutch development financier, decided to ""suspend all activities in Honduras, effective immediately. This means,"" FMO said in a statement, ""that we will not engage in new projects or commitments and that no disbursements will be made, including the Agua Zarca project."" Finnfund, the second European financier involved in Agua Zarca, suspended its support as well.
With the withdrawal of FMO and Finnfund, the pressure is on the Central-American Bank for Economic Integration to suspend all support for Agua Zarca. With $24 million, CABEI extended the biggest loan for the dam project, and has expressed confidence ""that the facts surrounding the death of Mrs. Caceres will be investigated and cleared by the corresponding authorities.""
In a joint statement signed by over a 100 organisations, the civil society groups who coordinated the international response to the murder in Honduras, including BankTrack, Both Ends, International Rivers and Oxfam International, welcomed the decisions by FMO and Finnfund. They also reiterated their ""demand to FMO, Finnfund and CABEI that, following the murder of Berta Cáceres after years of violence and intimidation in relation to the Agua Zarca project, they fully and permanently withdraw from the project.""
If civil society networks keep up their pressure, the suspension of support by European funders must surely be the beginning of the end of the ill-fated and violent Agua Zarca Project. But this doesn't mean that this tragic chapter can be closed:
All involved parties must continue to press for the safe release and return of Mexican activist Gustavo Castro, the sole witness of Berta's murder who is still kept in Honduras against his will. They must press for an independent international investigation of the murder. COPINH has called on the Dutch and Finnish governments to visit the Agua Zarca site. It is also high time for the US government to end its aid to a Honduran military which has frequently been associated with the human rights abuses in the country.
Indigenous peoples are disproportionally affected by dams, plantations and other resource extraction projects and by the violence which is often part of such projects. FMO and other development financiers have a long and sorry history of projects that have engendered violence against indigenous peoples, including the Agua Zarca, Barro Blanco and Santa Rita dams in Central America. FMO, Finnfund and other financiers must unequivocally recognize the right of indigenous peoples to free, prior informed consent regarding projects on their territories. The world's governments have recognized this right in a UN declaration, and it cannot be watered down to some kind of consultation in which the final decision rests with the investor.
Berta Cáceres' murder has become a symbol and a rallying cry for people around the world who are shocked and outraged by the price which marginalized people, and indigenous peoples in particular, frequently have to pay for projects that are supposed to bring economic and social development. They will continue to closely monitor the Agua Zarca Project and its aftermath, to make sure that Berta's sacrifice was not in vain.

Berlin ",How fair is my bank? Fair Finance Guide Germany launched,,,,,,"
On today's World 
Consumer Rights Day, a coalition of German non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs) is launching the first free online portal reviewing German banks' social 
and ecological guidelines: www.fairfinanceguide.de. Until today there has been 
no clear method for bank customers to collect independent information about 
how their banks consider human rights and environmental standards. But the 
demand by the public for increased social responsibility by their banks is 
growing. Representative surveys show that about 60 % of the German public 
would change their bank if it engages in food price speculation or invests in 
weapon manufacturers. Against this opaque background, the Fair Finance 
Guide Germany provides bank customers with a ranking of eight German 
banks' policies based on detailed research analysing over 240 criteria. The 
result: GLS Bank and Triodos Bank are the frontrunners, whereas Pax-Bank scores 
lowest.
""Bank customers have the right to know the guidelines a bank applies, and to 
which companies a bank provides financial support, this is also true for private 
pensions,"" says Thomas Küchenmeister, managing director of Facing Finance e. 
V., the organisation coordinating the Fair Finance Guide Germany. ""Banks play 
a central role in the transformation to a more sustainable economy. For this 
reason, social and environmental criteria need to be an integral part of their 
business model. If banks are unwilling to implement these standards on their 
own, sooner or later their customers will force their hand - and we seek to 
enable this process"", says Küchenmeister.
Of all the banks investigated, the GLS Bank and Triodos Bank guidelines fulfil the 
most evaluation criteria investigated under the topics of the Fair Finance Guide. 
They lead the ranking, followed by the Protestant KD-Bank. The Catholic 
Pax-Bank however, ranks lowest. ""The public guidelines of PAX-Bank have so far 
been considered to be largely vague and unspecific. In addition, the PAX-Bank 
was the only bank unwilling to enter into constructive dialogue about the results 
of the evaluation"", regrets Rank a Brand's Mario Dziamski.
Private commercial banks, public banks, as well as cooperative institutions, 
have, to varying degrees, huge deficits in terms of the implementation and 
transparency of social and environmental guidelines for sensitive and 
controversial sectors, for example mining and power generation. ""Our 
investigation shows that Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank and DZ Bank invest in or 
finance controversial companies despite policies to the contrary"", criticizes the 
project lead of the Fair Finance Guide Germany, Sarah Guhr from Facing 
Finance.
""Looking at the commercial banks the LBBW ranks lowest, even though the 
bank is a major player in financing renewable energy and has implemented a 
sustainability system"", says Antje Schneeweiß from Südwind. The reason for this is 
that the LBBW does not publish strict guidelines for many industries and business 
sectors, which require the bank to comply with norms such as the ILO's core 
labour standards. Furthermore, the bank is not willing to restrict it's financing of 
weapon manufacturers, beyond excluding cluster munitions, land mines, and 
countries under embargo, as Schneeweiß says.
Banks should also give greater consideration to climate policy. ""The Paris 
Agreement demands a climate-friendly restructuring of global financial flows. 
This requires banks to be more transparent about the risks related to fossil fuel 
investments, to restrict climate-damaging investments, and to push green 
investment opportunities. The top ranking banks in the Fair Finance Guide are 
clearly shown to be more ambitious than the other banks"", says Alexander El 
Alaoui, Co-Author of the study from Germanwatch.
The Fair Finance Guide Germany forms part of the Fair Finance Guide 
International network (www.fairfinanceguide.org), founded by Oxfam Novib 
and financed by the Swedish development agency Sida. Currently, the project 
exists in 8 countries with almost 40 human rights organizations, trade unions, 
environmental groups and consumer rights groups working together. "

San Francisco ",Deutsche Bank changes coal financing policy,Deutsche Bank ,Germany,Mountain top removal coal mining ,mining - coal ,United States,"
Today, Deutsche Bank (DB) released a new corporate responsibility policy explaining that the bank has begun to phase out the provision of finance to companies that practice mountaintop removal (MTR) coal mining. The updated policy indicates that they will decrease financing for the most significant MTR producers, without transparency around the timeline for finance reduction.  While this policy is a positive move for the bank, it remains incremental in nature, relies on the trend of decreasing MTR production overall, and ""the view that MTR is likely to be phased out in the near to medium-term future."" This ignores the fact that Deutsche Bank is the biggest banker of MTR, and currently finances Blackhawk, a coal company that has ramped up production at MTR mines over the past year. Deutsche Bank remains badly out of step on the issue of coal financing, as most of its US and European peers are ending financing for the entire coal mining sector, not just for MTR producers. This measure falls well short of what is necessary to meet the global goal to keep climate change to 1.5 degrees. In December Deutsche Bank signed the ""Paris Pledge for Action,"" committing the bank to accelerate the transformational changes needed to reduce global warming to within acceptable limits. Yet today's policy affirms the bank's continuing support of the coal sector, stating the bank believes ""Coal power is still necessary."" The bank, along with other financial institutions, must act quickly to transition away from financing fossil fuels, starting with an immediate halt to investment in the coal mining industry and coal-fired power production. ""Deutsche Bank continues to lag behind other banks by taking baby steps on MTR -- while others, having left behind this horrific practice years ago, are now cutting out coal mining altogether. We need an immediate and comprehensive end to the disastrous practice of mountaintop removal mining and real commitment to a carbon-free economy,"" says Amanda Starbuck, Program Director with Rainforest Action Network. Currently, Deutsche Bank is the largest banker of mountaintop removal mining, providing financing to top coal producers like Blackhawk to purchase mines from distressed and bankrupt coal companies. Meanwhile, Blackhawk is one of few producers to actually increase production of MTR coal in the past year. Mountaintop removal mining is a public health and environmental disaster and policies like this one that allow exceptions for future financing of this devastating practice are unacceptable. A growing body of peer-­reviewed scientific research has documented the catastrophic health and environmental impacts of mountaintop removal coal production, making it clear that Deutsche Bank would be wise to cut all ties to the practice. Impacted community members from Appalachia, a region where MTR has been heavily deployed, have traveled to Germany in 2013, 2014 and 2015 to confront the bank over its role in MTR finance. This policy announcement comes less than three months after the historic Paris climate talks, where 195 nations agreed to lower greenhouse gas emissions and to pursue efforts to limit the global average temperature from rising more than 1.5°C. Given those commitments, it is clear that business as usual in financing fossil fuel energy must radically shift to transition the world to a green economy and climate stability. "

San Francisco ","JP Morgan Chase cuts coal financing, joins majority of largest US investment banks",JPMorgan Chase ,United States,,,,"
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPMC) has released new commitments to cut financing for the global coal industry. The policy promises a transition away from financing for coal mining companies, and an all-out end for financing of new coal mines, responding to a global call by Anote Tong, the president of the climate-vulnerable small island nation of Kiribati, for a global moratorium on new coal mines. JPMC's policy also includes a prohibition on financing new coal-fired power plants in high income countries, and a recognition of the global commitment in Paris last December to limit climate change to 1.5 degrees. JPMC's commitment follows public pressure from climate activists as part of a campaign launched by Rainforest Action Network (RAN) last summer, the latest in a series of RAN campaigns to hold U.S. banks accountable for their financing of the coal industry. Now five out of the six largest US investment banks have committed to move away from financing coal mining, including Bank of America, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo. The policy change is a step in the right direction of moving away from some of the dirtiest carbon-based fuels. However, with the historic global Paris agreement last December, much more is needed to reach the goal of keeping climate change to 1.5 degrees. The bank, along with other financial institutions, cannot wait on political leadership for true climate action. These institutions must act quickly and lead the transition away from fossil fuels, starting with an immediate halt to investment in coal mining and coal-fired power globally.  ""In order to have a chance at stabilizing the climate, we need financial institutions to follow these commitments on coal mining with further steps to end coal financing altogether,"" said Ben Collins, Senior Campaigner at RAN. ""It's time for the financial sector to step up and lead the just transition we need to a clean, renewable future."" This policy announcement comes less than three months after the historic Paris climate talks, where 195 nations agreed to lower greenhouse gas emissions and to pursue efforts to limit the global average temperature from rising more than 1.5°C. Given those commitments, it is clear that business as usual in financing fossil fuel energy must radically shift to transition the world to a green economy and climate stability. "

Songdo, South Korea ","Green Climate Fund must say no to partnerships with HSBC, Crédit Agricole",Crédit Agricole ,France,,,,"
The Green Climate Fund (GCF) must not channel its money through two scandal-ridden international commercial banks that are leading funders of the coal industry, say civil society groups at a meeting of the GCF's Board in Songdo, South Korea.
The groups say that the GCF must reject applications for accreditation by big banks HSBC and Crédit Agricole. Accredited entities are institutions approved to receive and manage GCF funds.
""The Green Climate Fund Board must reject HSBC and Crédit Agricole. Creating new business for big banks with large fossil fuel portfolios and poor records on human rights and financial scandal would undermine the very purpose of the Fund,"" said Karen Orenstein of Friends of the Earth U.S.
""To accredit HSBC and Crédit Agricole is to short-change the vulnerable communities and the countries that the Fund is meant to directly benefit. There is no profit to be made in building the resilience of those adversely impacted by climate change. Public funds must be used to support local communities in developing countries, not to subsidize big banks,"" said Sam Ogallah of the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance.
The GCF's mandate to work directly with developing country institutions is what makes it innovative, the groups say. Targeted funding will help to build skills and expertise in poor countries, allowing governments to better meet the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable people in their countries.
""Accrediting HSBC and Crédit Agricole would be inconsistent with both the Paris Agreement, and with upholding high human rights standards. Any private sector partner of the GCF must have a credible strategy in place to make its entire portfolio and operations consistent with keeping global temperature rise to no more than 2 °C, let alone well below 1.5 °C,"" said Annaka Peterson of Oxfam.
""The accreditation of these banking giants would jeopardize the reputation of the Green Climate Fund and expose it to unnecessarily high fiduciary risk. HSBC and Crédit Agricole provided US$7 billion and US$9.5 billion, respectively, to the coal industry between 2009 and 2014, and their coal financing does not show a clear downward trend. Moreover, HSBC is deeply embroiled in massive financial scandal,"" said Yann Louvel of BankTrack.
A U.S. judge recently ordered the release of a report by an independent monitor overseeing the cleanup of HSBC's massive money laundering -- the report is said to be so damning that it would provide a ""road map"" for criminals seeking to launder money and finance terrorism.
172 NGOs released a statement calling for the rejection of HSBC and Crédit Agricole by the GCF. A copy of the statement can be found here. Appended to the statement are annexes on the fossil fuel financing trends of HSBC and Crédit Agricole, both of which fail to show a clear downward trend, while their renewables financing trails far behind their fossil fuel financing.

Hong Kong ",Indonesian banks ordered to stop all lending to coal-mining projects in East Kalimantan,,,,,,"
The Indonesian mining industry was dealt a double blow last week, a new Indonesian Coal Market Briefing from Greenpeace details.On Monday 15 February Indonesia's Corruption Eradication Commission announced that local authorities revoked 721 mining permits in 12 provinces - 478 of which are coal-mining permits. Two days later, the Financial Services Authority (OJK) ordered Indonesian banks to stop all lending to coal-mining projects in East Kalimantan, where 28 per cent of Indonesia's coal reserves are located.
The order for banks to stop giving credit to coal mines in East Kalimantan was announced at the OJK's annual meeting. The banks, including the Regional Development Bank of East Kalimantan, were clearly told that they must not simply reduce loans, but stop lending completely as world coal prices had fallen so low that the credit risk had become unacceptable.  "

Nijmegen ",New BankTrack Human Rights Impact Briefing: Labour standards violations in IOI Corporation’s Malaysian plantations,Bank of  ,China,IOI Corporation ,agriculture - palm oil ,Malaysia,"
Banks must do more to meet their obligations under UN guidelines to disclose their response to specific human rights impacts linked to their finance. This is the main conclusion of the first in a new series of Human Rights Impact Briefings released by BankTrack today, which assesses the responses of fifteen large commercial banks to evidence of serious labour standards violations by a company they financed, the Malaysian palm oil grower IOI Corporation.
The series of briefings intends to shed light on the extent to which banks are living up to their responsibilities under the UN Guiding Principles, by examining specific instances of human rights violations linked to bank finance, and asking banks to explain how they have responded.
For this first briefing, BankTrack presented banks with existing research by Finnwatch, the Finnish non-governmental organisation focused on global corporate responsibility, which documented how IOI Corporation had blocked foreign workers on their plantations from joining trade unions, withheld their passports - a recognised indicator of forced labour, and failed to pay some workers the minimum wage.
Banks were asked to detail how they had met their responsibilities to seek to prevent or mitigate these impacts. Under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, adopted in 2011, all businesses are required to seek to prevent or mitigate adverse human rights impacts that are directly linked to their operations, products or services by their business relationships. Further, they have a responsibility to account for how they address such human rights impacts by communicating this externally.
While all banks but one responded, half of these did not acknowledge their links to IOI Corporation or discuss the specific impacts raised in the briefing. This is despite the evidence of these financial links being available either publicly or on industry databases to which banks themselves provide information. Four banks cited concerns around customer confidentiality as reasons for not providing further disclosure.
Among the seven banks which did acknowledge their financial links to IOI Corporation, only three said that they had taken some action in response to the impacts outlined, either by engaging with the company or dropping it from funds labelled as ""socially responsible"".
BankTrack previously benchmarked banks on how they are integrating their responsibilities under the UN Guiding Principles into their policies, processes and reporting. On the basis of this briefing there seems to be no link between the quality of bank policies and the quality of disclosure: banks with good policies on paper showed very poor disclosure, and vice versa.
 ""The UN Guiding Principles ask businesses, including banks, to account for how they address their human rights impacts, by giving information that is ‘sufficient to evaluate the adequacy of the enterprise's response'. None of the banks we contacted provided information which we would view as meeting this standard - for example, while some banks said they had engaged with IOI Corporation, none of them indicated they had requested specific improvements from the company, or agreed any kind of follow-up plan"", said Ryan Brightwell, BankTrack's Human Rights Campaign Coordinator.
The report states; ""Meeting the requirements of the UN Guiding Principles, particularly under reporting, will require greater levels of disclosure than have been the norm until now. While banks have a duty to their customers to keep certain commercially sensitive information private, they must square this duty with their responsibility to provide information on how they have responded to particular human rights impacts. If client consent is needed for such disclosures, bank provision of finance should be conditional on such consent being provided.""
How banks responded
1. No response: Bank of China
2. Response with no comment on specific case: Credit Suisse; HSBC; Mitsubishi UFJ Financial; Mizuho Financial; Morgan Stanley; Sumitomo Mitsui Financial; UBS
3. Confirmation of link with IOI Corporation, but no response to issues raised: Citigroup; Intesa Sanpaolo; Société Générale; Standard Chartered
4. Response outlining some action taken in response to the issues raised: Crédit Agricole; Deutsche Bank; JPMorgan Chase

Munich / Berlin ","Self–regulation is good, independent oversight is better.",,,,,,"
NGO report unveils: social and ecological voluntary commitments by companies and banks cannot prevent human rights abuses, exploitation of workers, destruction of the environment, and corruption.
In
anticipation of the United Nations ""World Day of Social Justice"" on the 20th of February 2016, the Berlin NGO FACING FINANCE e.V. presents its DIRTY PROFITS
4 report. The report shows that voluntary commitments by companies and banks are
unable to prevent violations of social and ecological standards and norms,
which harm the population and environment.
17
researchers from 10 countries describe approx. 50 cases of human rights abuse,
corruption, exploitation of workers, and destruction of the environment caused
by the business activities of 20 globally active companies (e.g. ExxonMobil,
Zara, Nestlé, HeidelbergCement and Sanofi), as well as the financial
relationships supporting them (e.g. Deutsche Bank and Allianz). The 20
companies have total revenues of more than one trillion Euros with a profit of
more than 83 billion Euros. The OECD lists complaints against 8 of these
companies.
The DIRTY
PROFITS 4 report presented this Tuesday in Munich reveals extensive deficits in
the self-commitments of companies and banks. This refers especially to the
field of human rights, as well as environmental and climate protection. 18 of the
20 analyzed companies are involved in one or several cases of human rights
abuse. The report shows that 13 of the 20 companies are responsible for
environmental pollution and climate destruction. 10 companies have violated
labor rights, whereas 6 companies are involved in corruption and bribery. ""We
cannot allow the banks and companies to self-regulate, behind closed doors,
significant considerations such as human rights and the environment"",  says Thomas Küchenmeister from Facing
Finance.
Despite 16
of the 20 companies being on the exclusion list of hundreds on international
investors, 12 analyzed financial institutions still have financial ties with
these companies. For instance, the financial institutions in the report
invested more than 55 billion Euros in ExxonMobil, which is, to date,
responsible for 47 billion tons of carbon emission. The DIRTY PROFITS report
proves that 5 of the 12 selected financial institutions have financial ties to all of the 20 controversial companies (for example Allianz and BlackRock). Deutsche
Bank cooperates with 19 of the companies in the report. The main underwriters
of shares and bonds and loan providers are for example HSBC (9.9 and 2.2
billion Euros) and Deutsche Bank (7.9 and 1.1 billion Euros). Vanguard is also
tied to all controversial companies (74 billion Euros), in many cases as an
asset manager by order of a third party.
In 2012,
the United Nations human rights council passed a global standard to
prevent and rectify human right violations caused by economic activities, the
GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF BUSINESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS. However, only 6 of the 20
companies in the report mention or support the Guiding Principles on their
websites. The findings on the homepages of the financial institutions are
similar. Only 3 out of 12 financial institutions (e.g. Deutsche Bank) mention
the Guiding Principles as a standard, to which attention should be paid. None
of the evaluated Banks (excluding Asset Managers) have implemented specific
guidelines in relation to forced labour, for example in terms of business
partner using forced labor.
""Half of
the analyzed financial institutions are unwilling to accept even non-binding
minimal standards, e.g. the UN Global Compact"", deplores Thomas Küchenmeister.
Only 5 out of the 12 selected financial institutions apply the Equator
Principles, a voluntary set of rules for Banks to ensure environmental and
social standards for project funding.
To fully
consider environmental and social standards, financial institutions have to
exclude businesses from their investments that:

 disrespect
fundamental international labor and human rights;
 engage
in environmental destruction;
 profit
from massive corruption or that apparently integrate corruption as an element
of their business model;
 produce
controversial weapons;
 conduct
business activities in violation of international law, or invest in conflict
regions.

Financial
institutions must implement extensive guidelines, which ensure the compliance
of human and environmental rights. Financial institutions should establish an
easily accessible and effective grievance mechanism for individuals or
communities who feel adversely affected. Furthermore, they should improve the
transparency in terms of the social and environmental impact of their business
and investments.
Apparently,
voluntary commitments are not sufficient. For this reason, financial
institutions and companies have to be obligated by law to report the extent
to which ESG concerns are taken into account in corporate decision-making and
the social and environmental impact they have. The German federal government
has to transpose the EU Directive (2014/95/EU) for Non-Financial Reporting into
German law and should apply the disclosure obligation not only on the major and listed
companies. The federal government should ensure that the implementation of the
UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights take account of the responsibility
of the financial sector. "

Melbourne ",New poll: Australians draw the line at badly behaving banks,ANZ ,Australia,Wilmar International ,agriculture - palm oil ,Singapore,"
Almost half of Australians would consider changing banks if they became aware that the bank was behaving unethically, according to a new Oxfam Australia survey. The national survey, which examined attitudes of 1000 Australians towards Australian banks and ethical investment, revealed 75 per cent of respondents don't think that banks should provide loans to companies behaving in an unethical way.The findings come as an Oxfam Australia report released today reveals the savings of ordinary Australians continue to be used by the nation's four largest banks to back companies connected to land grabs that are forcing people off their land with little or no compensation.Oxfam Australia's Chief Executive Dr Helen Szoke said the 61 page report, Still banking on land grabs, provided new evidence that the ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank and Westpac were connected to companies in Cambodia, Brazil and Indonesia that had been involved in illegal logging, forced evictions, inadequate compensation, food shortages and child labour.""What is clear from our investigations is that, despite the big four banks claiming they've addressed the issue, no bank has done enough - the land grabs that we exposed two years ago continue to have devastating impacts on the lives of vulnerable people,"" Dr Szoke said.""Investments that involve land grabs are breaking up communities, increasing homelessness and hunger and dramatically reducing living standards.""Our research shows Australians care about how their money is invested. If most people knew that their money could be used to back companies that take land and homes away from people in some of the world's poorest countries, they'd be shocked.""Dr Szoke said everyday Australians were realising they had the power to demand that banks finance responsibly.""Since Oxfam's first report in 2014, more than 18,000 people have written to their bank and 20,000 have signed the petition to call for a Zero Tolerance for Land Grabs approach,"" Dr Szoke said.""Australians hold a huge, and very direct, stake in the financial sector's choices in how it uses our money - at home and overseas. Eighty cents out of every dollar that Australians have in their household bank accounts is with the big four banks.""Dr Szoke urged Australians to take action to ensure their bank takes responsibility for what happens in its operations, wherever they may be in the world - by signing Oxfam's petition or broaching the issue of land grabs directly with their bank.""We need banks to commit to Zero Tolerance for Land Grabs - this includes being transparent about their links to agriculture land deals, committing to increased due diligence, advocating responsible financing and supporting justice for affected communities,"" she said.Oxfam first raised the subject in 2014, in its report Banking on Shaky Ground - Australia's big four banks and land grabs,but all four banks have failed to ensure the affected communities' rights to food, shelter and a sustainable livelihood are restored.New evidence reveals for the first time that all four banks have committed tens of millions of dollars in loan facilities to Cargill - even after its then subsidiary Black River Asset Management was revealed to have made a series of problematic land purchases in Colombia. From 2010-2012 the company used 36 separate shell companies to acquire a large area of land that had been set aside for small-scale farming in the highly impoverished region of Altillanura, preventing poor rural families from being able to improve their income and quality of life.How have the big four banks responded?Under pressure from increasingly concerned customers and investors, the big four banks have claimed progress towards respecting land rights in their operations. While NAB and Westpac appear to be taking their exposure to land grabbing as a serious risk to their businesses, each developing new policies on land-related issues, CBA and ANZ have done little. But no bank has adopted a Zero Tolerance to Land Grabs approach.For more information, read more on our website and read our report.Ethical Investment survey resultsResults

80 per cent of Australians polled believe that banks that have investments that harm a community should provide some compensation to that community
47 per cent of Australians polled said that if they became aware that a bank was behaving unethically, it would strongly influence their decision about their choice of bank for future banking needs
75 per cent don't think that banks should provide loans to companies behaving in an unethical way (such as forcing poor communities overseas off their land)

",FoE response to final statement on  complaint guidelines on Rabobank and Bumitama,Rabobank ,Netherlands,Bumitama ,agriculture - palm oil ,Indonesia,"
Friends of the Earth's
response to final statement by the Dutch National Contact Point (NCP)
of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)  on
the case of loans by Rabobank to illegal operating
oil palm company
Bumitama, 15th of January, 2016.
Friends of the Earth has taken note of the NCP statement
published on Friday 15th January. Friends of the Earth welcomes
Rabobank's commitment that they will modify their current approach to handling complaints
and will publish their complaints procedure, including a time frame for the
procedure. This is what Friends of the Earth had advocated.
Friends of the Earth
also welcomes NCP's recommendation to Rabobank that they should devote more attention to being transparent with regard to engagement
with its clients specifically on
environmental and social issues.
However, Friends of the Earth finds the general findings
of the NCP very weak, most notably regarding the following:

NCP supports Round Table on Sustainable Palm
Oil (RSPO), whereas NCP does not have
indepth information and expertise on the challenges of this multi stakeholder dialogue. NCP fails to acknowledge the many failures of the RSPO. Many organisations have stated repeatedly the weakness of the RSPO and already
other initiatives are emerging
besides the RSPO.
Discussion   on     disengagement:    despite    the    fact    that    NCP     identifies    that
disengagement is an option under the OECD guidelines, in its statement it says: ‘the NCP
remains of the opinion that regarding this case disengagement of financial
institutions that adhere
to the RSPO principles will in general
not benefit the goal of sustainability. The NCP stresses the
importance of disengagement as a last resort.'
Friends of the Earth has brought cases of violations by palmoil companies, including Wilmar, since 2001 to Rabobank. NCP does not clarify when this
moment of disengagement arrives, but
surely after 15 years of bringing cases the time has come to conclude
that the palm oil sector is not a sustainable sector and that financiers
should divest from it. More than 10 years of RSPO have not brought
significant changes and recent forest fires in Indonesia, largely due to
palm oil companies, were one of the strongest in years. With its
strong unjustified reliance on engagement, the NCP risks giving
its blessing to the palm oil industry
as there is no threat of real sanctions from investors.
NCP proposes an evaluation at the end of 2017, but has not
formulated the criteria  in a
measurable way, so it is not clear what will be evaluated. There are also no sanction mechanisms identified.

Friends of the Earth concludes that NCP has not been able to address the underlying problem of Rabobanks' continuous financing of
palm oil companies.


Friends
of the Earth calls on financiers to do the following:

Withdraw their financial services
immediately from companies
in the palm oil sector found in breach of environmental and social commitments and legal obligations, to make clear that
there will be zero tolerance for breaches of the companies' and their financiers' environmental and social commitments;


Not rely on company-led reporting to ensure
them that sustainability policies are being implemented, but should seek monitoring that
is completely independent from companies
involved in palm oil, and should be prepared to suspend financing
when these policies are breached
by palm oil companies;


Include in
their contracts with investee companies a clause that allows them to cancel their
financial services in the event of breaches of the financiers' ESG policy.

Luxembourg ",Luxembourg: Serious gaps exposed in banking regulations to stem reckless arms trade that fuels atrocities,,,,,,"
Inadequate and incomplete regulations and policies on financing the arms sector mean there is little to stop banks from financing and investing in the production and transfer of internationally banned weapons or arms used to commit serious human rights violations, according to an Amnesty International Luxembourg report launched today.
The report, Banks, arms and human rights violations, looks into the failures of the Luxembourg financial sector to put in place regulations, policies and procedures to effectively curb financial support for arms-related activities.
While Luxembourg's banks are in the spotlight, the report's findings and recommendations are also applicable to other countries in the European Union and elsewhere.
""Financing and investment are not neutral activities; they shape and facilitate economic activity, including in the arms sector. Banks and other financial institutions have a crucial role to play in the global efforts to stem the manufacture, transfer and use of internationally banned weapons, or the use of authorized conventional arms to commit serious human rights violations and crimes under international law,"" said David Pereira, President of Amnesty International Luxembourg.
International law strictly prohibits the manufacture, stockpiling, transfer and use, of certain types of arms, such as biological and chemical weapons, anti-personnel landmines and cluster munitions, which are regarded as illegal on a permanent basis and under any circumstances. It also prohibits the transfer and use of conventional arms for serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law and crimes under international law, such as genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. 
""States have obligations and responsibilities under international law to ensure they are not complicit in the perpetration of serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, including in the financing of arms production. Banks may also incur liability when they provide financing or investment that supports activities related to internationally banned weapons and arms used to commit crimes under international law and serious human rights violations,"" said Gabriela Quijano, Business and Human Rights Legal Adviser at Amnesty International's International Secretariat.
Key findings
The report shows that, despite its international obligations, Luxembourg has failed to expressly prohibit all financial operations related to internationally banned weapons or conventional arms used in the commission of crimes under international law and serious human rights violations. The only exceptions have been curbs on financing activities relating to cluster munitions and arms destined for use in terrorism.
The research also shows a lack of transparency in the financial sector's policies and procedures on arms-related financial activities. Only two of seven top banks operating in the country contacted by Amnesty International Luxembourg provided the organization with a published policy on financing and investment in the arms sector.
The banks surveyed often appear to have an incomplete understanding of their legal obligations and human rights responsibilities. Even in cases where international obligations are not yet implemented into domestic law, banks operating in Luxembourg must comply with existing international standards. Business enterprises should respect human rights, independent from the state's own human rights obligations and laws.
""Insufficient domestic legislation is no excuse for the failure of Luxembourg's financial sector to adopt and implement adequate policies and procedures on the financing of the arms-sector,"" said David Pereira.
The report also identifies significant gaps in the banks' internal control procedures for arms-related transactions. The deficiencies spotted by Amnesty International Luxembourg (e.g. inadequate customer due diligence, lack of training for employees) tally with the observations made by the Luxembourg's Finance Sector Supervisory Commission (Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier). Any responsible policy on financing and investing in the arms sector requires effective internal control procedures to detect and prevent transactions relating to internationally banned weapons or arms reaching unauthorized end users and being used to commit or facilitate serious human rights violations or crimes under international law.
""This report has laid bare the lack of safeguards that would prevent banks from financing internationally banned weapons or arms used to commit or facilitate serious human rights violations or crimes under international law. We hope our findings will kick-start a robust debate among the financial sector, the authorities and the general public, in Luxembourg and abroad, on how to address this serious challenge and to ensure banks are not complicit in such violations,"" said Stan Brabant, Director of Amnesty International Luxembourg.
Recommendations
Amnesty International is calling on Luxembourg to strictly prohibit financial activities related to arms whose manufacture, stockpiling, transfer and use would violate international law. It should also take all appropriate measures to ensure the effective implementation and enforcement of this prohibition, and in particular define professional obligations applicable to banks and sanctions for non-compliance with such obligations.
Banks operating in Luxembourg must shore up their policies and procedures by:

committing, in policies which should be made publicly available, to stop all financial activities linked to internationally banned weapons or arms used to commit or facilitate serious human rights violations or crimes under international law;
taking all appropriate measures to comply with international obligations, by implementing due diligence procedures to detect risks and prevent the financing of internationally banned weapons and ensuring that their financial activities do not contribute to serious human rights violations and crimes under international law; and
strengthening contractual obligations with their clients and suppliers to ensure that all transactions comply with international arms control obligations and standards.

Background
The seven banks contacted in the course of this research were: Banque et Caisse d'Epargne de l'Etat, Banque Internationale à Luxembourg, Banque de Luxembourg, Banque Raiffeisen, BGL BNP Paribas, ING Luxembourg, and KBL European Private Bankers.
The scope of the report was limited by the availability of information and by communications policies of the banks in the sample. Information was gathered in the course of interviews and also via couriers and email correspondence between February 2013 and March 2015.
Amnesty International's research did not attempt at this stage to corroborate or ascertain whether the information provided by the banks matches actual investment and financing practices.
Luxembourg was among the first countries to sign and ratify the Arms Trade Treaty, which entered into force on 24 December 2014. It is also a State Party to the Chemical Weapons Convention, Mine Ban Treaty and Convention on Cluster Munitions. However, Luxembourg has not yet implemented many key international arms control commitments. "

",Indonesia takes unprecedented move to punish firms over deadly forest fires,,,OKI Pulp & Paper Mills ,forestry - pulp and paper,Indonesia,"
Indonesia is punishing more than 20 companies in an unprecedented move for starting deadly forest fires that killed 19 people, a government official said Tuesday. The companies - most of them pulp wood plantations operating on concession land in Sumatra and Kalimantan - have had their business licences suspended. The firms include BMH and SWI, which have concessions in South Sumatra. BMH is a supplier to Asia Pulp & Paper (APP) in Indonesia. BMH, SWI and APP have the same parent company, the Sinar Mas Group. The suspensions would be lifted if, within the next two years, the companies show that they have made significant progress in efforts to prevent future fires.Three more companies have been shut down permanently after having their licences revoked over their role in the blazes that choked vast expanses of southeast Asia with acrid haze and cost Indonesia $16 billion. among them Mega Alam Sentosa (MAS), another Sinar Mas controlled company.It is the first time the government has revoked company licences over forest fires, an annual occurrence caused by slash-and-burn land clearance.Several other companies have been given a strong warning and will be put under close supervision. ""We have sanctioned 23 companies in total, ranging from administrative sanctions to license revocation, while 33 others are still in the process, they could have their licenses revoked too if they are found guilty,"" environment ministry official Kemal Amas.The ministry has been investigating 276 companies in total since the fires broke out in September.""We need firmer law enforcement so that this catastrophe does not repeat itself, it’s been going on for 18 years but nobody has learnt their lesson,"" Amas said.Activists welcomed the government’s new commitment to punish firms. The Indonesian Forum for Environment (Walhi) said it was unheard of for the government to revoke licences, as many companies previously avoided facing trial. ""The minister has the courage to not only freeze the companies' operation but also chase the owners in a civil case, this is great and this must be guarded carefully,"" Kurniawan told. ""In the past some people were named suspects, but for them to actually lose their licenses, this is the first time,"" he said.More than half a million people suffered acute respiratory infections in Indonesia because of the haze, while many in neighbouring Singapore and Malaysia also fell ill.

Paris and Nijmegen ",From the Paris Pledge to the Paris Agreement,,,,,,"
After an intense year of campaigning and monitoring of coal banks, the Paris COP21 is now over and with it the first phase of our Paris Pledge campaign.
So, besides thanking you for your support and ongoing interest, we'd like to give you a quick update on outcomes of the campaign so far, and set out some next steps for coal banks after the Paris Agreement issued last weekend.
Six months after the official launch of the Paris Pledge campaign this summer, the initiative has been supported by 166 organisations and more than 10,000 individuals around the world, including the likes of Greenpeace, 350.org and Oxfam International, all sending one simple message to banks that it is time to quit coal. And groups like Friends of the Earth in France, urgewald in Germany and Rainforest Action Network in the US used the Pledge as part of their own campaigning.  
And so far the Paris Pledge campaign has resulted in:


21 small and ethical banks signing up to the Paris Pledge - they have all reaffirmed their commitment to stay away from coal financing in any shape or form


Nine international banks taking first steps out of coal and moving - at a variety of speeds - in the right direction.



On October 9, activists groups marched from Times Square to Morgan Stanley´s global headquarter where they planned to send a loud and clear message: DROP COAL.

On September 10, Les Amis de la Terre/FoE France visited a Parisian Crédit Agricole branch to push the bank to withdraw from the Plomin C coal power project in Croatia.

On November 24, urgewald delivered 6970 signed postcards to Deutsche Bank´s headquarters urging the banks to Do the Paris Pledge and quit coal.

The twenty-one signatories of the Paris Pledge, committing to stay clear of coal financing.
2015 has seen many firsts in the ‘Banks: Quit Coal!' campaign which started in 2011. Momentum has really picked up, and we are seeing more and more successful outcomes which are vital in the fight against climate change and the struggles endured by thousands of local communities around the world who find their lives tarnished by the effects of coal every day.
Here are some of the year's memorable moves:


The three largest French banks - BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole and Société Générale - committed to not finance any of the coal projects being recklessly proposed in the region of the Galilee coal basin in Australia, dubbed the world's second biggest ‘carbon bomb'.


Also in Australia, Standard Chartered and Commonwealth Bank both withdrew from financing the Carmichael mega mine project, bringing to 14 the number of big banks who have said ‘No' to financing Adani's climate-cidal plans there.


Big bank ATMs for highly destructive mountaintop removal (MTR) coal exploitation in the US have continued to close this year - many more banks, including Barclays and ING, announced they were cutting their MTR finance, notably around the bank AGM season in May, when BankTrack and our partners mobilised to advocate directly to bank shareholders.


A number of commercial banks have now adopted new financing policies which completely exclude the direct financing of coal projects, and in some cases coal companies. Crédit Agricole, Société Générale and BNP Paribas announced they will no longer finance coal mining projects, while Natixis and ING have also put an end to their direct financing of new coal plants.


There have never been so many meaningful moves by banks on coal. However, given the climate urgency we find ourselves in, some perspective on these bank moves is required. Our recent report ‘The Coal Test', published during the Paris climate negotiations, has captured the ‘snail's pace' rate of progress as major international banks finally get around to reducing their support for the climate's number one enemy.
 

Infographic from The Coal Test report

Where next after the Paris Agreement?
The agreement reached and finalised on Saturday 12 December in Paris may have a widely acknowledged array of weaknesses and concerning shortcomings, but its very realisation is a signal change in the climate debate - and it will have huge consequences, including for banks which are still committed to supporting the coal industry.
Yes, the negative aspects of the Paris Agreement are clear enough, most notably:


it contains no mandatory objectives for emissions reductions and no timeline for when emissions have to peak;


the current voluntary commitments made by the nations participating at COP21 still put the world on a path to 3 degrees or more of warming;


there is no clear commitment ensuring climate finance support from developed countries to developing countries at a minimum of 100 billion dollars per year, to cover the costs of addressing climate change, will materialise; and


compensation for loss and damage to the world's most vulnerable nations failed to appear in the final agreement text.


However, let's not forget that the agreement commits the 195 signatory nations to ""holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels"".
The Paris agreement also commits all 195 nations to ""making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development."" The 1.5°C reference sends a clear signal above all - this is the reality we are facing. And let's be clear, the challenges are great.
As ‘The Coal Gap', a Climate Action Tracker report published this month, tells us, even without any new coal plants, by 2030 emissions from coal-fired power generation would still be more than 150% higher than what is consistent with holding warming below 2°C, let alone 1.5°C. The trouble is, 2,440 coal-fired power plants are currently being planned around the world.
Banks will be asked to provide financing for these projects. Meeting the aims set out in the Paris Agreement simply means, though, that commercial banks must immediately stop all project finance for new coal, as Natixis and ING have already committed to do, as a first step. Bank financing for existing coal operations must then be quickly phased out, before reducing financial support for other fossil fuels.
Some banks - such as Société Générale, BNP Paribas and various Australian banks - have recently started to reference 2°C as a guiding principle for their future financing activities. They need to go further and adopt the 1.5°C target and implement what this entails - concretely - in their business activity: deep cuts in fossil fuels financing, starting with coal.
Coal bank campaigning in 2016
BankTrack will continue to track and chase in 2016, more than ever. We'll be monitoring the implementation of the commitments, mentioned above, by big banks and look to ensure that their financing is held to account to be in line with the 1.5°C pathway.
More than ever there is absolutely no room for dodgy coal deals to get off the ground with banking sector support. We're thinking of projects such as the Rampal coal plant in Bangladesh, the Batang coal plant in Indonesia and the Plomin C coal plant in Croatia, not to mention the ongoing saga surrounding the Galilee coal basin in Australia. We will continue to campaign to prevent bank financing of these atrocious projects.
We'll be there to remind the banks of the climate urgency, and that they will need to do a lot more than their new, voluntary Climate Principles if they actually want to stop bankrolling climate change.
BankTrack and partners will keep pushing to get banks out of coal. We look forward to your continuing support for the next phase of the Paris Pledge campaign.  "

","Indonesian peat fires linked to global palm oil companies and their financiers, Friends of the Earth report finds",,,Wilmar International ,agriculture - palm oil ,Singapore,"
This summer and fall, forest and peat fires burned on Indonesian palm oil plantations owned by global palm oil companies Bumitama and Wilmar International. A report released today by Friends of the Earth groups in Indonesia, Europe and the U.S. reveals that these companies, backed by major U.S. and European investors, created the conditions that stoked the fires -- despite the companies' voluntary ""no deforestation"" policies. Palm oil financiers have not taken significant steps to address the fires or their causes, the report says.Massive fires and haze caused enormous health and environmental problems in Indonesia and neighboring countries between August and October, 2015 -- at one point causing more daily CO2 emissions than the entire U.S. economy. Most of the fires were set deliberately to clear land for timber, pulp and palm oil plantations.The report, Up in Smoke: Failures in Wilmar's promise to clean up the palm oil business, examines the role played by two palm oil companies, Bumitama Agri and Wilmar International, in creating conditions that allowed the fires to burn out of control across thousands of hectares of ecologically sensitive land in Central Kalimantan. Using satellite maps, field investigations, and financial markets research, the report also details failures in the implementation of Indonesia's national moratorium on peatland development, and argues that major U.S. and European investors are complicit in creating the conditions that led to the fires.Arie Rompas, director of WALHI/Friends of the Earth Central Kalimantan, said ""The fires of 2015 caused enormous health and environmental problems in Indonesia -- and they were no accident. Out of control development of palm oil plantations was the cause of most fires in Central Kalimantan, and the companies are responsible for fires in their concessions. We need urgent action by our leaders to make these companies pay for the damage, and to prevent this from happening ever again.""The Indonesian government has made strong declarations and issued presidential decrees to prevent future forest fires and promote restoration of affected areas; but government bodies have repeatedly enabled palm oil companies to expand into fragile ecosystems, the report shows.Both companies, as well as many of the consumer companies that purchase their palm oil and the financiers that capitalize them, have sustainability policies in place which are supposed to prevent destruction of environmentally sensitive lands.""Corporate pledges of social responsibility have failed to prevent one of the worst climate disasters of 2015,"" said Jeff Conant, senior international forest campaigner with Friends of the Earth U.S. ""We call on the governments of Indonesia, the EU and the U.S. to implement strong and binding laws to prevent disasters like this from ever happening again.""Anne van Schaik, campaigner at Friends of the Earth Europe, said ""Banks and pension funds in the UK, Netherlands, France and the United States are providing direct financing to Bumitama and Wilmar -- despite many of them having publicly committed to Environmental, Social and Governance criteria that should prevent their financing such destructive activities. This report shows yet again that the Indonesian palm oil sector continues to be a high risk environment, as voluntary corporate commitments all-too-easily go up in smoke.""With civil society organizations, governments and corporations gathered in Paris this week for the UN climate talks, the Friends of the Earth groups argue that the voluntary policies of corporate actors and their financiers are failing to prevent the huge climate impacts of industrial palm oil expansion.     "

Paris, France ",Civil society statement in response to the launch of financial sector voluntary climate principles,,,,,,"
Today, on Monday December 7, 11 banks including the World Bank, European Investment Bank and Crédit Agricole, are announcing the launch of 'Five Voluntary Principles for Mainstreaming Climate Actions Within Financial Institutions' at the UNFCCC COP21 Climate Summit in Paris, France. 
BankTrack, Friends of the Earth France and Rainforest Action Network have jointly issued the following statement in response:
These voluntary principles highlight the lack of climate leadership at the world's largest banks. Not one mention is made of the major role financial institutions have to play in decarbonizing the global economy - first and foremost by signing the 'Paris Pledge to Quit Coal' and publicly committing to phase out financing for coal mining and coal-fired power worldwide.
""The urgency of addressing the biggest drivers of climate change has never been more pressing than it is here at the Paris COP summit, and yet the words ‘fossil fuels' still don't appear in these new climate principles,"" said Yann Louvel, Climate and Energy Campaign Coordinator at BankTrack. ""While some financial institutions have recently started to cut their financing for coal mining and coal power, the sector still refuses to collectively recognize that the one key climate action they need to take is to phase out their financing of fossil fuels.""
Lucie Pinson, Private Banks Campaigner at Friends of the Earth France, said: ""These new principles still focus on the risks posed by climate change for the business activities of banks. What we urgently need is for banks to focus on the risks their business is posing to the climate.""
""The principles are vague, incremental and distracting from the real work that needs to be done by financial institutions to address their role in climate change,"" said Amanda Starbuck, Climate & Energy Program Director at Rainforest Action Network. ""They represent pure and simple greenwash.""
This is the latest in a series of attempts by the financial sector to adopt a unified approach to climate finance. Already in 2008, just before the Copenhagen COP climate summit, a consortium of European private sector banks announced 'The Climate Principles'. Those principles also lacked the necessary ambition to create a fundamental shift in business practice and quickly faded into obscurity.
Also, the Equator Principles, a framework which guides bank management of environmental and social risk, only adopted language referencing climate change in 2013, after ten years of deliberation and still hold no requirement for banks to reduce their financing of carbon-intensive fossil fuels.
A new report published at COP21 last week by BankTrack, Friends of the Earth France, Rainforest Action Network and urgewald notes that between 2009, the year of the Copenhagen climate summit, and 2014, the world's biggest commercial banks put only 40 percent as much financing into the renewable energy sector ($104.59 billion) as into coal alone ($257.02 billion).

Paris, France ",BNP Paribas coal finance impacts earn Pinocchio Climate Award from the public,BNP Paribas ,France,Tata Mundra Ultra Mega Power Plant (UMPP) ,energy plants - coal,India,"
French bank BNP Paribas has been awarded a Pinocchio Climate Award for its global financing of the coal industry, including huge coal-fired power plants in South Africa and India. Following a month of public voting organised by Corporate Europe Observatory and Friends of the Earth France, the award to the French banking sector's biggest coal supporter was made at a ceremony in Paris during the COP21 international climate talks, where BNP Paribas is one of the corporate sponsors. 
In the run-up to COP21, and in the face of mounting pressure from campaigners, BNP Paribas announced a new approach to coal financing which sees it ending its support for all new coal mining projects around the world. However, the bank will continue to consider the financing of coal-fired power plant projects in lower income countries, comprising more than 80% of the global coal market. 
A new report also released this week at COP21 by BankTrack, Friends of the Earth France and partner organisations as part of the Paris Pledge campaign showed that BNP Paribas is among the top five coal banks globally, with financial support for the industry totalling $14.84 billion since 2009's COP15 in Copenhagen. 
Yann Louvel, Climate and Energy campaign coordinator at BankTrack, commented:
""This latest public recognition of BNP Paribas' huge, devastating coal finance legacy further highlights its ludicrous sponsorship role at COP21 and, significantly, it is the bank's role in the financing of the likes of the mega Tata Mundra coal power plant in India which has seen it receive a Pinocchio Climate Award.
""Not only do such investments drive climate change for decades but local communities in Gujurat have already suffered health and livelihood impacts since the power plant commenced operations. While BNP Paribas has recently made new commitments which curtail its financing for the coal industry, its new coal power plant criteria would not rule out support for another giant coal plant in low income countries. BNP Paribas and other banks will face continued public pressure until they take the necessary responsible steps to fully end their engagement with coal, the number one contributor to climate change.""
Lucie Pinson, Private finance campaigner at Friends of the Earth France, said:
""The experience with harmful community impacts from the Tata Mundra plant in India must surely now make BNP Paribas consider that bankrolling big coal clients such as Tata Power is a lot more trouble than it's worth, and sever all ties with the industry. More than this, though, having provided $327 million in financing for the project, BNP Paribas has to accept it has certain responsibilities for such a problematic project. Yet it has been dragging its heels and has failed to publish a project assessment all year.
""We urge BNP Paribas to now carry out a thorough and independent assessment of Tata Mundra's social and environmental impacts, and following this ensure that affected people are properly compensated for the clear disruption to local fisheries in particular.""

",Banking sector's climate leadership claims undermined by coal billions – New report,,,,,,"
A new report released
today analyzes the coal financing of the world's largest banks. As the UN climate conference convenes in Paris, the report, The Coal Test: Where Banks Stand on Climate at COP 21 finds that seven ‘front runner' banks have taken
recent steps to reduce and stop financing coal mining or coal-fired power.
However, coal policies at several other banks fail to adequately address the
challenge of climate change, and none of the global banks assessed are
considered ‘true climate leaders', as not one has yet pledged to end financing
for the coal sector entirely.
The report also describes the alarming scale
of the banking sector's support for the coal industry in the years between the
Copenhagen and Paris climate summits: $257 billion in coal financing has flowed
from big banks between 2009 and 2014. The top five coal-financing banks since
COP 15 in Copenhagen are Citigroup ($19.65 billion), JPMorgan Chase ($18.80
billion), Royal Bank of Scotland ($15.86 billion), BNP Paribas ($14.84
billion), and Bank of America ($14.44 billion).
Rainforest
Action Network, BankTrack, Friends of the Earth-France, and urgewald released
the report as part of the global Paris Pledge campaign, which is calling on banks to end financing for
coal.  
""In
the run-up to Paris we've heard many banks insisting that they are leaders on
climate,"" said Catalina von Hildebrand, Paris Pledge Campaign Coordinator at BankTrack, ""as
if the $257 billion they've poured into dirty coal in the years between the
Copenhagen and Paris COPs is an irrelevant accounting error. It's time they
start making amends by dumping coal and rapidly boosting their finance for
clean energy.""
""As
COP 21 begins, some major European financial institutions have begun to
transition away from financing coal mining and power,""
said Ben Collins, Senior Campaigner at Rainforest Action Network. ""However,
Wall Street dominates the top of the list of the world's biggest coal banks,
and it is past time for laggard banks in the U.S. and around the world to cut
ties to the fuel.""
The Coal Test analyzes coal policy strengths
and weaknesses, highlights where non-committal banks fall short, and spotlights
a pervasive lack of climate leadership at the world's largest banks. The report
also compares coal financing commitments from 15 of the world's biggest private
sector banks in France, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the
United States.
Katrin Ganswindt of the German NGO urgewald
noted: ""Even Germany, a country in a remarkable energy transition, has a major
climate killer bank ranking in the top 10 coal banks. Deutsche Bank's dirty
coal portfolio is just one of many scandals damaging its reputation.""
Lucie Pinson, campaigner at Friends of the
Earth France added: ""This year, we have seen some banks, particularly
French banks, adopt policies to reduce their coal financing. But while these
commitments do not go far enough, several other global banks have yet to commit
to reduce their support for coal at all. Banks in France and other countries
must recognize that climate science calls on them to cut all, and not just some
of their financing for coal. NGOs will continue to monitor energy financing by
banks after COP 21 to make sure they shift their financing from coal to
renewable energy.""
Catalina
von Hildebrand concluded: ""With the world convened to take real climate action
in Paris, it is urgent that banks demonstrate true leadership on climate and
commit to end their financing for coal once and for all."" "

San Francisco ","Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo cut coal financing, join growing movement by banks in U.S. and Europe",Morgan Stanley ,United States,,,,"
Today, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo released new commitments to cut financing for the global coal industry. Wells Fargo's policy committed to reduce the bank's lending to coal mining companies. Morgan Stanley's policy went further, covering both lending and underwriting, and committing to end financing for coal-fired power plant construction in developed countries.
These policy changes follow similar coal financing cuts at seven other banks earlier this year (Bank of America, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Crédit Agricole, ING, Natixis, and Société Générale). Morgan Stanley's commitment followed public pressure from climate activists as part of a campaign launched by Rainforest Action Network (RAN) in October, the latest in a series of RAN campaigns to hold U.S. banks accountable for their financing of the coal industry.
""Today Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo announced they are cutting support for the coal mining sector, adding momentum to recent commitments made by Bank of America, Citigroup, and several others,"" said Lindsey Allen, Executive Director of RAN. ""While the policies announced today do not go nearly far enough to realign the banking sector with the reality of climate change, they are a clear indication that major banks agree coal is an increasingly foolish and unacceptable investment.""
Notably, Morgan Stanley's coal policy statement acknowledges that the bank has a responsibility to contribute to the transition to a low-carbon economy and commits to report on the bank's policy commitments to cut financing for coal mining and coal-fired power.
These policy announcements come a day before President Obama meets with President Anote Tong of Kiribati and other leaders of small island states, who have called for a global moratorium on new coal mines. They follow calls from the Paris Pledge, a global coalition of over 160 global civil society organizations which has urged the banking sector to phase out financing for coal mining and coal-fired power in the leadup to the U.N. climate conference underway in Paris, COP21.

Nijmegen ",ING becomes latest bank to stop finance for new coal,ING ,Netherlands,,,,"
ING, the largest bank in the Netherlands, has become the latest to announce it is withdrawing from financing new coal power and mining projects. The move ""suddenly makes ING a front runner on climate change among the large global banks"" according to BankTrack, which has been calling on banks to publicly commit to quit coal in the run-up to the Paris climate summit, which starts next week.The announcement also included a commitment to avoid financing any new clients generating more than 50% of their business from coal power or mining. ING also said that it is committed to reducing its exposure to coal in the future. BankTrack research carried out last year showed that ING was among the 30 banks most heavily involved in financing the coal industry , with finance of over USD4.5 billion for coal between 2005 and April 2014. 60% of its coal finance came from the bank's lending business, and 40% from underwriting of shares and bonds.Johan Frijns, BankTrack director, commented: ""After years of delay, today's announcement suddenly makes ING a front runner among the large global banks on climate change, with a clear and unambiguous statement to immediately end finance for new coal, and reduce its finance going forward. However the new commitment is not comprehensive, and still allows ING to continue its underwriting of billions in bonds and shares for coal companies.""""We have called on all commercial banks to sign the Paris Pledge to fully phase out their finance for coal. We've seen 21 smaller banks step forward and take this pledge . With its position today, ING need only elaborate on their plans to reduce their future coal exposure, and extend this to all its financial service provison, to be among them. In the wake of moves from Allianz earlier this week to divest from mining and utilities companies which generate over 30% of their revenues from coal , it is clear that responsible businesses in the finance sector are finally abandoning coal.""Notes: ING's press announcement is available here.

",Allianz Says Goodbye to Coal Industry,,,,,,"
This morning, the world's largest insurance company, Allianz, announced its decision to undertake a major divestment action from the coal sector. In reaction to a campaign by the German environment organization, urgewald, Allianz stated it will divest shares of mining companies that derive over 30% of their revenues from coal and divest shares of utilities that produce over 30% of their power through firing coal. The Munich-based insurer will also phase out its bond investments in these companies. According to Allianz, the divestment action will amount to 4 billion €.
""This is incredibly good news for our climate and much bigger than the divestment action taken by AXA,"" says Heffa Schücking, director of urgewald. Based on a threshold of 50%, the French insurer AXA announced the divestment of around 500 million € from the coal industry last May. ""If well-implemented, Allianz's divestment action sets a new standard for insurance companies and asset managers all over the world,"" adds Schücking. ""
""We are glad that first the Norwegian Parliament and now the board of Allianz is convinced of our divestment approach. Climate-oriented divestment requires threshold values not only for the turnover, but also for the production of electricity. This hits both the mine operators as well as coal-based utilities like RWE and Vattenfall, ""says Schücking.
Over the past months, urgewald has been calling on Deutsche Bank and Allianz to make a ‘Pledge for Paris' as these two institutions are Germany's largest investors in the global coal industry. ""Allianz has shown it is willing to step up and take action for our climate. Now it's time for Deutsche Bank to move,"" says urgewald divestment campaigner, Kathrin Petz. In order to make sure Deutsche Bank gets the message, urgewald activists delivered 7,000 petitions and dumped several wheelbarrows full of coal at the bank's Frankfurt headquarters this morning.

Nijmegen ",Leading responsible banks pledge to quit coal as climate summit approaches,The co-operative bank ,United Kingdom,,,,"
Today the UK's Co-operative Bank and Netherlands-based Triodos Bank became the latest banks to confirm they will continue to steer clear of providing finance for coal mining and coal power, by signing BankTrack's Paris Pledge.  First signed by six banks in early September, today's commitment from two of Europe's leading responsible banks brings the total number of Paris Pledge signatories to 18, from ten countries around the world. The 18 signatories to date collectively have over EUR 85 billion in assets under management. Less than two weeks before the United Nations Climate Summit in Paris, a broad civil society coalition of over 160 organisations including Oxfam, Greenpeace and 350.org continues to call on the world's top banks to end their coal financing and focus instead on the $13.5 trillion of energy saving and low carbon investments that the International Energy Agency deems necessary over the next 15 years.   The most recent signatories include:

Alternative Bank Schweiz (Switzerland)
Beneficial State Bank (USA)
Ecology Building Society (UK)
Folkesparekassen (Denmark)
GLS (Germany)
JAK (Sweden)
La Nef (France)
Merkur Cooperative Bank (Denmark)
NewB (Belgium)
ProCredit Bank (Germany)
The Co-operative Bank (UK)
Triodos Bank (Netherlands)

 They join ASN Bank from the Netherlands, Banco Fie from Bolivia, Ekobanken from Sweden, New Resource Bank from California, and Ethikbank and Umweltbank from Germany to make up the 18 signatories. Catalina von Hildebrand, BankTrack's Paris Pledge campaign coordinator, commented: ""With the climate rhetoric of large banks now hotting up before the Paris Climate Summit, often focusing on everything but their own fossil fuel portfolio, it's great to see these 18 banks taking the lead for the banking sector and signing the Paris Pledge. Their step confirms that real climate action means clearly saying no to coal. The Co-operative Bank is the first high street bank in the UK to sign the Pledge to date. Laura Carstensen, chair of the bank's Values and Ethics Committee, said: ""As the only UK Bank with a customer led ethical policy, which includes a commitment not to finance the extraction or production of fossil fuels, we are delighted to sign the Paris Pledge, to stop the financing of coal powered energy production. The impact of global climate change is an issue that is a major concern to our customers, which is why we don't provide banking services to any business or organisation whose core activity contributes to the damage being caused to the environment."" BankTrack, with support from over 160 global organisations and over 10,000 individual supporters, is calling on all private sector banks to publicly commit to rule out financing for coal mining and power by doing the Paris Pledge.

",BNP Paribas and Société Générale move away from coal – but not far enough,BNP Paribas ,France,,,,"
Less than two weeks before the start of the United Nations Climate Summit (COP21) in Paris, new approaches to coal financing announced by top French banks BNP Paribas today and Société Générale yesterday have been described by bank campaign organisations BankTrack and Les Amis de la Terre - Friends of the Earth France as ""a good start but still lacking in ambition"". This is in spite of the welcome introduction of new financing criteria that sees both banks reducing their support for coal mining and power as well as committing to boost their financing for renewable energy. 


The new policy announcements from BNP Paribas and Société Générale commit both banks to end their financing for all coal mine development projects globally. BNP Paribas and Société Générale have also ruled out financing for coal-fired power projects in high income countries, though this covers no more than 12% of the global coal market. 

 

Unlike another French bank, Natixis, which recently announced that it is stopping direct financing for all coal plants around the world, BNP Paribas and Société Générale have also confirmed that they will continue to consider financing for coal-fired power plant projects in lower income countries. 

 

BNP Paribas has also announced that it is ending its general funding for companies specialising in coal mining enterprises which have no diversification strategy. The bank, currently France's number one coal finance bank according to BankTrack research, has further said it will only provide financing for ""power generation companies that have a formal diversification strategy to reduce the share of coal in their power generation mix that is at least as ambitious as that of their host country.""

 

Société Générale has committed on its side to ""reduce the group activities in the coal sector with a view to being in line with the International Energy Agency's 2 degree scenario by 2020"", but it remains to be seen how this general statement will concretely translate in terms of banking activities.

Yann Louvel, Climate and Energy campaign coordinator at BankTrack, commented:


""BNP Paribas and Société Générale have made promising new commitments to double their financing for renewable energy investments in the coming years. The issue remains, however, how much more could France's top banks, including also Crédit Agricole, be doing to ensure the clean energy transition takes place rapidly if they weren't still wedded to coal investing around the world in various guises.


""In their respective approaches, BNP Paribas and Société Générale have begun to disentangle themselves from the biggest climate threat. However, the concrete implementation of their commitments will be crucial since general corporate lending and underwriting comprise almost all of the financial support of these banks to the coal sector, with 15.6 billion euros from BNP Paribas and 5.5 billion euros from Société Générale flowing out between 2005 and April 2014. We will continue to extend our invitation to them to sign up to the Paris Pledge in order to bring about an end to their coal financing for good."" 

Lucie Pinson, private finance campaigner at Friends of the Earth France, commented:


""New coal plants cannot be built anywhere if we're to limit the increase in global temperature to below 2°C, yet BNP Paribas and Société Générale are only ruling out their support for them in high income countries.


""Looking at BNP Paribas, after more than a year of campaigning from Friends of the Earth France and our partners for the bank to end its support for the coal industry, we welcome these first commitments. But BNP Paribas, a COP21 sponsor after all, cannot stop here. Friends of the Earth France and our international partners will publish a comprehensive assessment of the commitments of French and international banks during COP21. This will lay out new data showing the extent of the coal financing still present at banks such as BNP Paribas and how they must move up a gear in order to respond to the climate emergency. BNP Paribas has also been nominated for the Pinocchio Climate Awards, and we hope that further encouragement from the public will inspire the bank to take comprehensive climate action.""

Geneva ",Financial institutions drop the bomb from their investment portfolio,,,,,,"
53 financial institutions prohibit or limit investments in nuclear weapon producers, shows Don't Bank on the Bomb, a report published today by Dutch peace organization PAX. This is a 150% increase compared to last year's report. The increase illustrates the growing stigmatization of nuclear weapons because of the renewed focus on their humanitarian consequences. The report also identifies 382 banks, insurance companies and pension funds which have made USD 493 billion available to nuclear weapons producers since January 2012. Based on evidence presented in the report, activists worldwide call on financial institutions to stop any investments into weapons of mass destruction, and on governments to ban nuclear weapons once and for all. 

The PAX report shows how these stigmatizing policies result in new exclusions by a number of institutions, including Fonds de Compensation (Luxembourg) and Nordea (Sweden). PAX researcher Wilbert van der Zeijden, co-author of the report: ""No bank, pension fund or insurance company should have financial relations with companies involved in weapons of mass destruction. In the case of a nuclear detonation, the humanitarian consequences will last for decades and effective aid will not be possible. The only way to prevent this from happening is to outlaw and eliminate nuclear weapons. Stigmatizing these inhumane and indiscriminate weapons, and excluding them from investments, will help.""Nuclear weapons are the only weapons of mass destruction not yet explicitly prohibited under international law, a legal gap that 121 countries have pledged to fill. By stigmatising nuclear investments, these 53 financial institutions help pave the way towards a nuclear weapons prohibition treaty. Hall of FameInvestments in nuclear weapon producers are not a necessity but a choice, as is shown by 13 financial institutions listed in the report's Hall of Fame. These institutions have outstanding policies preventing any types of investment in any company with association to nuclear weapons. These institutions are based in Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Susi Snyder, co-author of the report: ""Divestment makes it clear to producers that as long as they are involved in nuclear weapon programmes, they will be considered illegitimate, and a bad investment.""Top 10 investorsThe report details identifies 382 banks, insurance companies and pension funds with investments of a total of 493 billion dollars in 26 companies involved in the production, maintenance or stockpiling of nuclear weapons. The top 10 investors alone provided more than USD 209 billion to the identified nuclear weapon producers. All of the top10 are based in the US. The top 3: Capital Group, State Street, and Blackrock, have more than 95 billion USD combined invested in the producers named in this report. In Europe, the most heavily invested are BNP Paribas (France), Royal Bank of Scotland (United Kingdom) and Crédit Agricole (France). In the Asia-Pacific region, the biggest investors are Mitsubishi UFJ Financial (Japan), Life Insurance Corporation of India, and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial (Japan).The report was presented today with a video launch. The full report is available at www.dontbankonthebomb.com and www.paxforpeace.nl.

Nijmegen, Netherlands ",New report: Fossil fuels receiving over 9 times more finance than renewable energy from world’s top banks,,,,,,"
The world's 25 largest private sector banks channelled at least USD 931 billion into fossil fuel companies in the period 2009-2014, according to a new report launched today by Fair Finance Guide and BankTrack, while over the same period the banks' financing of renewable energy totalled USD 98 billion. 
Alexandre Naulot, spokesperson at Fair Finance Guide International, said:
""This analysis, the first international study to compare private sector bank financing of fossil fuels and renewable energy, identifies the alarming priority that banks have been giving to dirty energy over clean energy since 2009, the year of the Copenhagen climate summit. Up to the end of 2014, for every dollar the banks have channelled into renewable energy, they've provided more than 9 dollars for fossil fuels. Now, more than ever, we need to start seeing some firm commitments from the banks to quickly stop this business as usual.""
The new Fair Finance Guide and BankTrack report, ‘Undermining our Future', analyses 75 financial institutions in total and is published less than a month before the beginning of the United Nations Climate Summit in Paris (COP21). The energy sector investment figures detailed in the report are based on publicly available information, though due to a lack of full transparency across the institutions the figures should be taken as minimum amounts. 
Also revealed by the report, three US banks Citi, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America are the largest fossil banks. Between 2009 and 2014, Citi and JPMorgan Chase each provided over USD 76 billion to fossil fuel companies and only USD 6.5 billion and USD 4.4 billion respectively to renewable energy. Bank of America provided USD 62.7 billion to fossil fuel companies, and only USD 5.4 billion to renewable energy.
Of the broader ‘top ten' institutions, including well-known French, German, UK and Japanese banks, individual renewable energy investment totals nowhere exceeded USD 7.5 billion for the period 2009-2014. These figures, dwarfed by the corresponding fossil fuel financing totals, contrast with these banks' regular statements on their desire to play a role in combating climate change.
Naulot said: ""Banks play a pivotal role in the economy and have a responsibility to promote a less carbon intensive world. We certainly hear enough from them about their green finance aspirations, but they lack clear commitments. Clear and ambitious climate commitments from the banks and governments will be crucial at the Paris summit.""
As noted by the report, many of the researched financial institutions do not have climate change mitigation policies or commitments in place.

Yann Louvel, climate and energy coordinator for BankTrack, said: 
""We need ambitious action from the banks now. The likes of Crédit Agricole and Natixis in France and Bank of America and Citi have made positive moves in recent months to restrict their support to the coal industry. Yet no major international bank has so far done the Paris Pledge, and committed before COP21 in Paris to a full phase out of coal financing. This is the kind of practical commitment we need to see happening, to bring an end to the fossil fuel favouritism and the strangulation of the banks' financing in renewable energy."" 


Alexandre Naulot said: ""Governments also need to act. We need them to adopt strong legislations that will mobilise the financial sector towards a low carbon economy and that will encourage the banks and financial institutions to phase out of fossil fuel, starting with coal.""

",Mobilising the financial sector for a sustainable future,,,,,,"
In the context of crucial agenda-setting moments in 2015, including the December meeting of COP21 and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the role of the financial sector is increasingly being questioned. The incorporation of social and environmental aspects into the financial sector is one of the responses. This means that the financial system would not only be financially stable - which has been a focus of many recent financial reforms - but would also serve the needs of societies and economies that develop in an equitable, inclusive and environmentally sustainable way.
This report provides a mapping of existing initiatives that aim to incorporate environmental and social sustainability aspects within the financial sector. They either aim at integrating sustainability in the financial sector as a whole, or specifically at changing and influencing behaviour of banks and investors. To do so, the approaches or strategies range from mandatory regulations, to voluntary measures and citizens' advocacy and campaigns. The report aims to be a source of information for civil society and others with an interest in addressing sustainability in the financial sector in the most effective way.
Read more how supervisors in some countries like Brazil and China are imposing mandatory requirements that bank loans do not risk environmental damage. Or how the many initiatives that provide information to investors about their social and environmental impact remain voluntary. 
This report does not analyse the different initiatives but provides critical questions in order to raise a debate about effective solutions. It supports initiatives and discussions such as the seminar in Paris on 5 November co-organised by Finance Watch about ""Climate Change: How to shift the model?"". SOMO also supports the ""Dashboard"" launched by Finance Watch on 5 November 2015 that indicates whether the financial sector becomes more sustainable and supportive of the public interest.  "

","Green Climate Fund must say no to HSBC, Crédit Agricole partnerships",Crédit Agricole ,France,,,,"
The Green Climate Fund (GCF) must not channel its money through two scandal-ridden international commercial banks that are leading funders of the coal industry, say civil society groups at a meeting of the GCF's Board in Livingstone, Zambia. The groups say that the GCF must reject applications for accreditation by big banks HSBC and Crédit Agricole. Accredited entities are approved to receive and disburse a share of the $10.2 billion pledged to the GCF. ""The Green Climate Fund Board must reject applications from HSBC and Crédit Agricole. Creating new business for big banks with poor human rights records and large fossil fuel portfolios undermines the very purpose of the Fund,"" said Karen Orenstein of Friends of the Earth U.S. ""Accepting HSBC and Crédit Agricole as partners at the Green Climate Fund will only confirm the suspicions of many governments and civil society organizations about the role of the private sector in financing the new Paris deal. Public funds must be used to support local communities in developing countries not to subsidize big banks,"" said Tim Gore of Oxfam. ""When communities need support to cope with climate impacts, it is not loans or foreign investments that will help. There is no profit to be made in building the resilience of the poorest and most vulnerable. HSBC and Crédit Agricole are the wrong choices for a fund that is meant to directly benefit vulnerable communities,"" said Sam Ogallah of the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance. The GCF's mandate to work directly with developing country institutions is what makes it innovative, the groups say. Targeted funding will help to build skills and expertise in poor countries, allowing governments to better meet the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable people in their countries. ""HSBC and Crédit Agricole are both heavy investors in the fossil fuel industry, which makes them the wrong partners for the Green Climate Fund. Commitments to deliver green projects are not enough. Private sector partners of the GCF need to have a credible strategy to make their entire portfolio and all of their operations consistent with human rights and with the 2° Celsius global warming limit set by the international community, and preferably a 1.5° Celsius limit,"" said Lutz Weischer of Germanwatch. Civil society groups are calling on the Green Climate Fund Board to only approve accredited entities with clear commitments to fighting climate change, and to prioritize the approval of domestic entities in developing countries. Over 120 NGOs released a statement calling for the rejection of HSBC and Crédit Agricole by the GCF.

Kiev, Nijmegen ",Investor Alert on DTEK (Ukraine) debt restructuring,Deutsche Bank ,Germany,DTEK ,energy plants - coal | mining - coal  | oil and gas,Ukraine,"
BankTrack and the National Ecological Center of Ukraine today sent an investor alert to relevant financial institutions, bringing to their attention a number of issues related to the operations of Ukraine coal giant DTEK, which they may want to consider when engaging with the company on a debt restructuring proposal. The full text is below:
Dear Sir/Madam,
It is our understanding that Ukraine's
biggest private power producer DTEK is currently trying to conclude a debt restructuring agreement with your bank and several other European
banks, and is seeking a delay in the payment of most of the
company's $3 billion debt. In light of this, we would like to bring to your
attention a number of issues related to the way DTEK is operating, issues which
we believe should be taken into account by your bank when discussing a new
agreement with the company.
As you know, a significant part of
DTEK's business comprises its activities in the coal sector. In 2013, DTEK
controlled 53.8% of coal
production in Ukraine and 38.3 per cent of the distribution and sales of
electricity; it operates ten coal-fired power plants across Ukraine
through three subsidiaries. The average age of DTEK operated thermal power plants (18.6
gigawatts in total) is now 45 years. The high operational costs of its power
plants, their low energy efficiency and the increasing maintenance costs due to
their ageing are contributing to the tight financial prospects for DTEK.
DTEK's financial situation has, of
course, also become perilous as a result of the conflict situation which has
affected eastern Ukraine since spring 2014, leading to a severe disruption of the shipment of coal by DTEK out of
rebel-held eastern Ukraine.
DTEK's inability to comply with common
EU environmental and business standards imposed by the EU Association agreement
and Energy Community Treaty
As a state with ambitions to become an
EU member state and to become a part of the emerging common energy market,
Ukraine will be pressed to curb its pollution levels. Under the decisions of
the Ministerial Council of the Energy Community, Ukraine is obliged to develop
a National Emissions Reduction Plan by 1 January 2018, and to begin
implementing it thereafter.
In the next 10-15 years the energy
sector of Ukraine will have to face the decommissioning of 12 GW of coal capacity, this because of
the EU's Industrial Emissions Directive (IED 2010/75/EC) and the EU's Large
Combustion Plants Directive (LCPD 2001/80/EC), which Ukraine is now obliged to
adhere to under the Energy Community Treaty and which calls for the closure of
unmodernised, polluting units. This will further affect the operations of DTEK.
Furthermore, DTEK's operations are also
out of step with EU norms relating to:

 market rules (fair competition and
equal access to the grid, especially trans-boundary power lines for exports);
 energy rules (the requirement to
unbundle and separate vertically integrated utilities' generation and sales
operations from their transmission networks, to encourage fair competition).

Indeed, as regards market rules, in
2013 the Energy Community opened a formal dispute settlement procedure against Ukraine, which is
effectively a case concerned with DTEK's monopoly on electricity exports from
Ukraine to the EU. This dispute has not been resolved and the procedure is
ongoing. As for energy rules, specifically the EU's 'Third Energy Package', a large vertically integrated utility
such as DTEK will be fully affected and have to comply with the requirements.
How DTEK's coal activities are
adversely impacting the environment
Emission levels per kWh of electricity
produced in Ukraine are much higher than in the EU due to the low efficiency of
the country's power plants and inadequate equipment for pollution control. None
of the coal-fired power plants operated by DTEK has primary pollution control
for sulphur (SOx) or nitrogen oxide (NOx) and at some DTEK power plants dust
emissions are more than 50 times above the limits stipulated by EU regulations.
None of these plants would be allowed to operate in any EU country because of
their emissions, or they would have a strict deadline for closure, as happened
with the Varna power plant in Bulgaria which was closed down on 1 January 2015 due to non-compliance
with EU environmental regulations.
Moreover, between 2010 and 2013, DTEK
strategically increased its coal production and power generation. This included
DTEK's acquisition of two coal-fired power plants in western Ukraine (Burstyn
and Dobrotvir) and a significant increase in their output, allowing increased
electricity exports to Ukraine's neighbours Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and
Poland. However, the cheap electricity from Burstyn and Dobrotvir which EU
businesses and households have received has resulted inincreased greenhouse gas emissions and toxic air pollution in Ukraine.
Financing from European commercial
banks has been central to this export of carbon intensive, coal-based
electricity from Ukraine to the EU. In 2013 Deutsche Bank, together with
Raiffeisen Bank, Erste Group, UniCredit Austria and the Russian Gazprombank,
granted a structured pre-export
financing loan for DTEK, providing $375 million for export-oriented
activities.
Recommendations
In the view of our organisations, and
illustrated by the far from exhaustive description of problematic issues
outlined above, DTEK is a company operating with an outdated business model,
that has a deep negative impact on the environment, climate change in
particular. It needs fundamental restructuring, not only to bring it into
compliance with relevant EU legislation but also to move its current operations
away from the coal sector, towards renewable energy generation - currently renewables account for only 1% of DTEK's total electricity production. 
Whether the company is capable and
willing to restructure itself along these lines remains to be seen, but the
debt restructuring process now under discussion with your bank provides a rare
opportunity to help steer it in this direction.
Should your institution agree to extend
DTEK's debt liabilities without addressing the way the company is currently
operating, it would be seen by many observers in the Ukraine and elsewhere to
be condoning and allowing the continuation of the company's irresponsible
approach to managing its carbon emissions and other environmental impacts.
Such a perception could be mitigated
if, as part of any debt restructuring agreement, the banks involved in the
restructuring process insist on conditions that would reduce DTEK's impacts on
the environment and climate change.
We believe that the minimum conditions to be
attached to any agreement reached with DTEK should be: a substantial decrease
in the carbon intensity of the company's electricity production, through
efficiency improvement, switching to natural gas and an increased share of
renewables (and in due course the closure of obsolete coal power plants), and;
a commitment from the company to promptly undertake a restructuring strategy
which can ensure compliance with EU energy and environment regulations,
including the Industrial Emissions Directive.
While we understand that such a
restructuring process will lead to an extension of your institution's current
relations with DTEK, we also would urge you to seek - in due course - to
completely disengage from a company that is so deeply rooted in the old, fossil
fuel based economic model that Ukraine, as with all other countries in the
world, urgently needs to leave behind.
Instead we recommend that in the
future, when considering further investments in the Ukrainian energy sector,
you look to support only low carbon, renewable energy initiatives. In spite of
the current challenging conditions in Ukraine, renewable energy has become a
dynamically developing sector in the country, providing the bulk of newly
installed capacity in recent years - the sector doubled its share in
electricity production from 1% in 2013 to 2% in 2014. 
These gains now need to be ramped up,
and financial support from international commercial banks can play a vital role
if Ukraine's renewables sector is given high priority.
We hope this letter will be of use to
you in your discussions with DTEK. If you require further clarity on any of
these issues, we would be very happy to discuss further with you or your
relevant staff. 
Yours sincerely,

Nijmegen ",Four steps for the Equator Principles to regain their ambition and relevance,,,,,,"
As the 81
banks which are signatories to the Equator
Principles (EPs) gather in Washington DC for their annual conference
tomorrow, few external observers will hold their breath for what is to come. Since
2013 when the latest version of the Equator Principles was released (EPIII), the
Equator Principles Association (EPA) seems to have lost its ambition to be the
leading, ‘gold standard' sustainable banking initiative it once proclaimed to
be.
Perhaps
EPIII itself already showed the signs of this reduced level of ambition.  Despite
18 months of negotiating, adopting banks failed to make crucial commitments in
the areas of transparency, human rights, accountability and climate change, while
some commitments they did make have still not been met.
BankTrack
has engaged and lobbied the Equator Principles Association and signatory banks since
their first release in 2003, believing that the Principles, if properly
implemented, could have a real impact on the projects banks finance, and their
outcomes for communities and the environment.  However, having grown to represent 81 banks, its
needs to show that it still has the ability to do so.
After two
quiet years merely busy with implementing a deficient EPIII, BankTrack now considers
it high time for the Equator Principles Association to step up its ambition
level again. In a letter sent last week to the Chair of the Steering committee,
we highlighted four steps the Association needs to take for the initiative to
regain its ambition and its relevance:
1) Increase transparency and show where the Equator
Principles are at work
With the
adoption of EPIII, Equator banks committed themselves to submit the names of projects
they finance under the Principles for publication on the Equator Principles
website.  Unfortunately, banks allowed themselves the get-out clause that
disclosure of project names was to be subject to obtaining the consent of their
clients, instead of making this a standard condition of any loan agreement made
under the Principles.
Despite
this serious limitation, the commitment to disclose which projects fall under
the Equator Principles looked like an important step forward. However, two year
later and well over three months after the list was due, it remains nowhere to
be seen on the Equator website. This is a serious failure of the Association to
live up to one of its flagship new commitments. As well as publishing this list
urgently, BankTrack requests the Association to assess the level of compliance it
has seen from banks, and consider making public reporting of project names a
mandatory rather than voluntary part of the Equator Principles.
2) Align fully with the UN Guiding Principles
on Business and Human rights
EPIII makes
explicit, though circumferential, reference to the United Nations Guiding
Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP), the human rights guidelines for
business adopted by the UN Human Rights Council unanimously in 2011. However the
reference fell short of a clear commitment by all Equator banks to fully follow
the UNGP in their financing of projects under Equator.
For
example, EPIII states that banks only need to conduct human rights due
diligence ""in limited high risk circumstances"" - wording which seems to imply
that human rights due diligence should be the exception rather than the rule,
even among the large infrastructure projects the Equator Principles are
designed to cover. This wording is not grounded in the Guiding Principles, and
such discrepancies need clarification.
The Equator
Principles Association can remedy this gap by providing clear guidance for
adopting banks on how to implement the UNGP, including how they should ensure
proper access to remedy for rights holders whose rights have been violated by
bank financed projects. 
3. Establish a complaints mechanism 
BankTrack
has argued ever since the foundation of the Equator Principles in 2003 that the
formal commitment of banks to take into account the impacts of their lending
activities on the environment and local communities naturally requires the
existence of a mechanism for such stakeholders to be able to file grievances,
or otherwise contact the banks involved, when they feel their rights and
interests are affected by Equator loans.
This view
is underscored by the UN Guiding Principles, which state that ""industry,
multi-stakeholder and other collaborative initiatives that are based on respect
for human rights-related standards should ensure that effective grievance
mechanisms are available"", and even that ""the legitimacy of such initiatives
may be put at risk if they do not provide for such mechanisms"". 
With confirmation
at the level of the UN that initiatives such as the Equator Principles are
putting their legitimacy at risk with their continued refusal to establish any
sort of complaint mechanism, it is now high time for the Association to
establish such a mechanism.
4. Tackle climate change, move away from
financing fossil fuels
Given that
the Equator Principles are a risk management tool for banks, it was astonishing
that EPIII included virtually no commitment for adopting banks to do their part
in dealing with the biggest risk of all; catastrophic climate change. EPIII does
state that ""negative impacts on ... the
climate should be avoided where possible"" but this does not preclude
adopting banks to provide finance for the exploration and burning of fossil
fuels (coal, gas, oil).
With six
week to go before the Paris climate summit, BankTrack calls on the Equator banks
to address this severe shortcoming of EPIII and now make a strong commitment to
start phasing out their finance for fossil fuel projects. One concrete and
realistic step that all Equator banks can take, individually or collectively,
is to ‘Do the Paris Pledge' and publicly commit to phase out their
support for the coal industry, in line with the call from BankTrack and 145
other organisations.

",Natixis becomes second French bank to cut coal financing,Natixis ,France,,,,"
French bank Natixis has this week taken a leading climate position among major commercial banks, by announcing the end of its financing for coal fired power stations and thermal coal mining projects worldwide.  A new policy, released on Thursday, also commits the bank to stop financing companies which generate over 50% of their business from coal power or thermal coal mining.
The move comes two weeks after Crédit Agricole made further cuts to its coal finance in a new coal power policy, and one week after Citibank announced it will be reducing its lending exposure to coal mining. The new commitment from Natixis leaves BNP Paribas, a sponsor of the upcoming United Nations climate change conference but also a major financier of coal, increasingly isolated among the French banking sector in its failure to cut financing for the fossil fuel, which is a main driver of climate change.
Campaigners from BankTrack and Friends of the Earth France welcomed the move from Natixis and called for the bank to go the extra mile and commit to produce a full coal finance phase out plan by signing the Paris Pledge before the Paris climate conference. 
Lucie Pinson, private finance campaigner for Friends of the Earth France, commented:
""Earlier this year, Natixis announced the end of its financing to some mountaintop removal coal mining companies, but it was the last big French bank to do so. This time, it is the first one to announce a complete end to all coal project finance and to pure player coal companies, going further than recent announcements from Crédit Agricole. We still need to get some details of this new policy, and see the full policy made public, which Natixis has not done with other policies, but this is a good step towards the end of coal financing.""
Natixis, the corporate and investment arm of BPCE, ranks as the fourth largest French ""coal bank"" and the 41st internationally, with 1.711 billion euros in coal lending and underwriting between 2005 and April 2014. 
Yann Louvel, Climate and Energy Campaign Coordinator for BankTrack, added:
""Very concretely, these new commitments will stop Natixis from continuing to lend to companies like Cloud Peak in the United States or SUEK in Russia, mining companies specialised in coal above the 50% activity threshold adopted by the bank. Since Natixis financed them in the past few years, this is good news that they will stop doing this. But they are still far from a complete end to the bank's coal finance, since the scope of the policy seems to cover neither underwriting activities nor the giant Natixis asset management branch of the company, which manages more than 800 billion euros. Moreover, the 50% threshold adopted for companies active in coal leaves many major coal companies not impacted.""
Lucie Pinson concluded:
""This move from Natixis stands in stark contrast to the silence coming from BNP Paribas, an official COP21 sponsor, which has supported the coal sector with more than 15 billion euros in finance over the past decade. The breach is now open and we see that mobilisation for the end of all coal financing by banks pays off. It will end only when all banks climate damaging support will be transferred to the energy efficiency and the renewables sectors.""

Market Forces is reacting to news this morning of a new set of commitments from ANZ regarding climate change and coal investments.
""When it comes to leadership on climate change, the podium remains empty, and in desperate need of a bank to step up"", said Market Forces Lead Campaigner Julien Vincent.
""The announcements made today by ANZ on climate change are almost satirical in their ineffectiveness, actually creating space for the bank to worsen its climate footprint over time. We urgently need to see leadership from the finance sector in driving our economy to a low-carbon footing - ANZ has just declared itself out of the leadership race"".
ANZ's new climate change ""commitments"" will allow the bank to:

Continue lending to new coal-fired power stations that have the worst emissions intensity of the latest coal power technology, potentially raising the average emissions intensity of the power stations it finances (currently stated by ANZ as 0.69 tonnes of CO2 per Megawatt hour).
Lend to new and existing coal mines anywhere around the world, including the mega coal mines proposed by Adani in the Galilee Basin, which they have repeatedly failed to rule out.
Remain invested in any current coal fired power station provided there is a plan (the nature of which is not defined) in place for how emissions would fall beyond the lifetime of the power plant.

While the commitment to finance $10 billion of emission reductions efforts by customers over five years is welcome, when this is put in perspective of a global renewable energy industry that has attracted over US$1 trillion of investment over the same time span, it's fair to expect that most banks would lend this sort of money to emissions-reducing efforts as a matter of routine.
""At the heart of any strong climate change policy is a commitment to operate in a way that is, at the very least, consistent with keeping global warming to less than the internationally agreed two degree limit. From there, the bank can take the steps that will get itself, and the broader economy on a low-carbon footing.""It is clear that if we are going to contain global warming to within manageable limits, we have just about burned our last lump of acceptable coal, and that the vast majority of fossil fuel reserves need to be kept in the ground.""
""The transition in energy generation needs to be swift, and the challenge is daunting, but the opportunities for investment, economic growth and job creation are immense. We can either choose to take this challenge on, or end up spending more money cleaning up after the damage that runaway climate change will bring.""
ANZ is Australia's biggest lender to the fossil fuel industry, having loaned $12.6 billion to coal, oil and gas projects since 2008. For every dollar the bank lends to renewable energy, it lends another $6 to fossil fuels. ANZ was involved in more than half of the deals to fossil fuel projects in Australia since 2008, making it not just the biggest, but also most prevalent lender to coal, oil and gas. "

San Francisco ",Citigroup takes a step away from banking coal,Citi ,United States,,,,"

Earlier today, Citigroup, the parent company of Citibank, committed to take a significant, though partial step away from banking coal. The company updated its environmental policy statement, stating that it had begun to cut its credit exposure to coal mining and that ""going forward, we commit to continue this trend of reducing our global credit exposure to coal mining companies."" This policy change makes Citigroup the third global bank to commit to broad industry-wide cuts to coal mining finance this year, and the first to do so since the launch of the global Paris Pledge calling on banks to end financing for coal mining and coal-fired power.
Overall, the policy change is a positive one, signaling that Citigroup is moving away from lending to an industry that is incompatible with a low-carbon future and a major contributor to climate change. However, Citigroup's policy change leaves some major loopholes and unanswered questions:

It is incomplete, covering only part of Citigroup's banking relationships with coal mining companies - This commitment to reduce its ""credit exposure"" commits Citigroup to reduce corporate lending to coal companies, but not the bank's continued involvement with the industry through issuing bonds and shares. This leaves a big loophole for the bank to continue to underwrite new debt and equity for coal mining companies.


It lacks a clear timeline and phase-out commitment - Although the bank states that it has already begun to reduce its exposure to coal mining, reducing exposure is not the same as ending it. RAN will be monitoring the bank's participation in transactions with coal mining companies closely to assess how this commitment is moving the bank towards phasing out its lending involvement with coal mining altogether.


It does not address the bank's financing relationships with coal-fired power - Last year, Citigroup financed $2.5 billion for the largest operators of coal power plants in the world. The bank's policy change is silent on these transactions, a key gap, especially after Crédit Agricole announced significant cuts to coal power financing last week.

With less than two months before the Paris climate conference, we're long past the time for incremental steps away from coal. It's time for banks to stop financing it, period. As Anote Tong, President of the low-lying island nation of Kiribati wrote in August, the development of new coal mines ""undermines the spirit and intent of any agreement we may reach...To avoid catastrophic climate change, we must leave the vast bulk of carbon reserves in the ground.""
Bottom line, time is running out for Citigroup's competitors on Wall Street, including Morgan Stanley, to get on the right side of history on climate and coal by cutting ties to coal mining and coal-fired power. "

Paris, France ",Major blow for Croatian coal plant as Crédit Agricole announces new coal power policy,Crédit Agricole ,France,Plomin C coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Croatia,"
Today's publication of new criteria for coal-fired power plant financing by French bank Crédit Agricole suggests that the bank will not be able to finance the controversial €800 million Plomin C coal power plant in Croatia, believe campaign groups.  The policy now rules out finance for coal power plants in high-income countries, which includes Croatia.
The new policy from Crédit Agricole has been announced less than a month after the publication by Friends of the Earth France and Croatia, BankTrack and CEE Bankwatch Network of a study which shows the incompatibility of the Plomin C project with the bank's own corporate social responsibility standards.  Crédit Agricole had responded to the report and publicly defended its advisory role in the project . However today's policy changes now rule out the bank's involvement in Plomin C.
Lucie Pinson, campaigner at Friends of the Earth France, said:
""This is one more victory for civil society against the banking industry's support for coal and we welcome this further step from the only French bank so far to have ended its support for coal mining.""
Bernard Ivčić, director of Friends of the Earth Croatia, said:
""By losing the support from its advisory bank, the project promoter Marubeni will now be faced with a much bigger problem to find the necessary financing from international banks. This is one more obstacle for a project that besides being a hazard for health and the environment also violates local and European laws. Alternatives to fossil fuels exist. Only 12.5% of wind potential and 0.2% of solar photovoltaic potential has been utilised in Croatia. Crédit Agricole must focus its support in these high potential energy sectors."" 
Yann Louvel, Climate and energy coordinator for BankTrack, said:
""The adoption of new coal criteria by Crédit Agricole proves that mobilising is paying off. Already in March this year we congratulated the commitment from French banks not to finance the development in Australia of the world's largest coal zone, as well as the decision from Crédit Agricole to end its support for coal mine projects and for companies specialised in the coal mining sector. Today we are stepping up pressure on all international banks to serve notice to the coal sector before the Paris climate summit by signing the Paris Pledge to quit coal."" 
Other major banks, such as BNP Paribas, a sponsor of the Paris climate summit and France's top coal financing bank, have yet to make any commitments that would bring about an end to their coal financing. 
Lucie Pinson commented:
""We are still a long way from climate excellence and the new Crédit Agricole policy is still very disappointing given the stakes. New coal-fired power plants should not be being built anywhere. Yet the Crédit Agricole policy only rules out finance for them in high-income countries. Thus, it's business as usual in 88% of the market. These new criteria only make Crédit Agricole the best of the worst students in the class, but it is vital that other banks now start to move."" 
Civil society organisations are now focused on stepping up pressure on the worst coal finance offenders, including BNP Paribas in France, Deutsche Bank in Germany and Morgan Stanley in the United States. Friends of the Earth France is calling on customers of major banks to participate in a day of action on October 10 and switch their accounts away from climate damaging banks to banks with no fossil fuels in their portfolios.

",Investment Alert on Coal India share offer,,,Coal  ,mining - coal ,India,"
The following is an investor alert sent by BankTrack to financial institutions on September 21. Dear Sir/Madam,We are writing to bring to your attention matters that have a direct bearing on your bank's commitment to a more sustainable low carbon economy. The Government of India recently invited bids from banks to arrange another share offering for Coal India Limited, one of the world's largest coal miners. This company has been implicated in serious environmental destruction and human rights abuses and has shown no willingness to address these issues.Indeed, in this year's 'Coal Finance Report Card', published by Rainforest Action Network, Sierra Club and BankTrack, Coal India was one of several companies to receive the 'extreme coal mining' label because of these type of egregious activities which have faced sustained criticism from local communities and global civil society organisations.The 'Coal Finance Report Card 2015' also discusses further in relation to Coal India that:""Following an initial public offering in 2010 that involved the sale of 10% of Coal India's equity, an underwriting consortium involving Bank of America, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, and Goldman Sachs finally managed after two years of delay to sell an additional 10% of the company's shares in January 2015. While Coal India attempted to portray the sale as a success, foreign investor interest was minimal amidst concerns about rising costs of production and the difficulty in expanding production while keeping operating costs low. Another government firm quietly purchased nearly half the offering to save face. The company has also been accused of misleading investors and the public about the extent of its extractable reserves.""There are a number of new and ongoing issues related to Coal India's coal mining activities which we believe provide highly compelling grounds for your bank not to involve itself in the forthcoming (bids due by September 23) and latest Coal India share offering.1. Forced displacement of communities to enable mine expansionsCoal India has a worrying record of forcible resettlement of communities, including Indigenous and Dalit communities, in order to expand its mines. While the company, when challenged, cites its resettlement policy and commitments to comply with the law, Amnesty International has documented ongoing forced displacement of communities in connection with the expansion of a coal mine operated by a Coal India subsidiary in Chhattisgarh. For more information about these abuses, see this Amnesty International report from September 2014.In December 2014, the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change gave SECL, a Coal India subsidiary, permission to expand production at its open-cast coal mine in Kusmunda from 18.75 mtpa (million tonnes per annum) to 62.5 mtpa. The expansion is expected to lead to the displacement of 9250 families in 17 villages and affect another 5475 families. See also this further Amnesty International update on the situation from February this year.2. Broken commitments as biodiversity and forest impacts continueCoal India's continuing reliance on open-pit coal mining involves clear-cutting forests - with grave impacts for forest communities and endangered species like tigers, leopards and elephants. Moreover, recent commitments from the company refer to its reforestation and land reclamation practices. However, only this July, an Indian government investigation found that half of the land Coal India claimed it had reforested was still barren.3. Promised engagement with civil society has not materialisedAs part of Coal India's environmental and social commitments made to four US and European banks (Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, and Deutsche Bank) in the lead up to its most recent share offering in February 2015, the company committed to engage with civil society stakeholders, including NGOs, on a range of issues, including the company's impacts on biodiversity. Yet the company has not followed through with Greenpeace or other NGOs in a meaningful way after making this commitment.The company now plans to double coal production by expanding areas under mining but has so far not released information on what impacts this increased mining will have on forests or communities.A further alarming development in India since the beginning of this year should also be noted, and should be of major concern to responsible investors: The client in the planned share offering, the Government of India, has been targeting civil society organisations that have criticised the coal industry. Since taking power in May 2014, India's current leadership has publicly touted its close ties to major coal companies, weakened environmental and human rights regulations, and systematically cracked down on environmental organisations and other civil society groups. These actions have prompted public criticism from the U.S. State Department as well as the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Assembly and Association.The Government of India has admitted this crackdown is linked to coal and has refused to scale back its coal expansion plans, in spite of the impacts of expanded coal production on communities, ecosystems and the climate. By facilitating the government's share offering, banks which choose to participate in the transaction would be in effect lending tacit support for the government's position on coal, including its attacks on legitimate voices that have raised concerns about the impacts of coal mining on some of India's poorest communities.If you require further clarity on any of these issues, we would be very happy to discuss further with you or your relevant staff.In conclusion, we would ask your institution not to lend support to Coal India - to profit from the company's latest share offering, and contribute to further environmental and social wrongs, would strongly undermine any aspirations your institutions has of helping to support the transition to a low carbon economy. And we, and our allies around the world, will not hesitate to publicise such a regrettable move, should you opt to assist and support one of the world's most extreme coal companies.Yours sincerely,     "

",Morgan Stanley pressured to drop coal financing,Morgan Stanley ,United States,,,,"
 Today, Rainforest Action Network (RAN) announced that Morgan Stanley is the next major investment bank being targeted with a public campaign to demand that the bank commit to stop financing coal mining and coal-fired power.
""Morgan Stanley has longstanding financing relationships with some of the worst offenders from the global coal mining industry, including Peabody Energy, the world's largest private sector coal mining company,"" said Ben Collins, Senior Research and Policy Campaigner at RAN. ""Last year alone, the bank financed $477 million for coal mining.""
Morgan Stanley continues to finance top producers of mountaintop removal coal, even as eleven of its competitors have committed to cut financing for the practice. The bank also financed $1.2 billion in 2014 for the largest operators of coal-fired power plants in the world such as RWE, Europe's largest single emitter of carbon dioxide.
For fifteen years, RAN has been holding the U.S. banking sector accountable for its environmental and human rights impacts, most recently campaigning against Bank of America's coal financing. Earlier this year, Bank of America and Credit Agricole both adopted new policies that took major steps away from financing coal. Now RAN is demanding Morgan Stanley and the rest of Wall Street meet and exceed these commitments by adopting comprehensive policies to end financing for coal mining and coal fired power.
In the lead up to the Paris climate conference in November, RAN has joined with over 120 other civil society groups partnered in the Paris Pledge that calls on the global banking sector to end financing for coal mining and coal-fired power. Global political and civil society leaders have called for a rapid transition away from fossil fuels. This year is becoming the make or break moment for global banks to decide how they will choose to invest in the future of energy. "

",Crédit Agricole violating own coal policies with new Croatian power plant support – new report,Crédit Agricole ,France,Plomin C coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Croatia,"
French bank Crédit Agricole's support for a proposed major new coal plant project in Croatia is inconsistent with the bank's climate ambitions and its own sector policy on coal-fired power plants, according to a new study released today. The analysis, by Friends of the Earth France and Croatia, Zelena Istra, CEE Bankwatch Network and BankTrack, screens the risks of the 500 megawatt Plomin C project proposed for development in the picturesque Istrian peninsula, a popular international tourist destination.  Less than three months before the United Nations climate summit in Paris, and with Crédit Agricole presenting itself as taking a responsible stance on climate change, Croatian and international groups are launching a campaign with actions held today in Paris and Zagreb aimed at ending Crédit Agricole's role as financial advisor in the estimated €800 million Plomin C project.  Pippa Gallop, Research co-ordinator at CEE Bankwatch Network, said: ""The Plomin C project, if it proceeds, would violate both local and European laws and regulations. The coal plant lacks an alternative assessment, the project promoters have failed to address relevant climate and energy dependence issues, not to mention the coal plant's very real economic risks. After assessing all the potential impacts of the project, our study finds that by supporting this project Crédit Agricole is violating the principles which it claims to its customers and shareholders to be upholding."" Crédit Agricole announced in May this year that it is ending its funding for coal mine projects and companies specialised in the sector ""in order to cut down on the use of fossil fuels and meet the objective of limiting global warning to 2°C by the end of the twenty-first century"".  However, the campaign groups believe that this welcome move from the bank is being compromised by its ongoing support for coal plants.  Crédit Agricole, the only international bank currently supporting the construction of the Plomin C coal plant project, provided more than 4.7 billion euros in financing for the coal power sector over the last ten years, making it one of the top 20 climate-damaging banks worldwide.  Lucie Pinson, private finance campaigner for Friends of the Earth France, commented: ""The termination of Crédit Agricole's support for coal mines is a healthy first step towards a total exit from fossil fuels. But the bank seems not to have fully grasped the unequivocal point being advanced by scientists. If we are to leave more than 80% of the world's coal reserves in the ground to limit global warming below the 2°C threshold, then we simply cannot afford to carry on building new coal power plants that will emit millions of tonnes of CO2 for decades to come.  ""Crédit Agricole must immediately withdraw from Plomin C if it is sincere in its claims about wanting to fight climate change. As long as it maintains its support for this project led by notorious polluters Alstom and Marubeni, Crédit Agricole will continue to be responsible for worsening climate change."" A referendum in March 2015 found that 94% of the Istrian population were against Plomin C. The project is currently the subject of several court cases. Bernard Ivčić, director of Zelena Akcija/Friends of the Earth Croatia, commented: ""Croatia hasn't produced coal for years, so this project will do nothing for the country's energy security or for raising living standards. In fact, the project may lead to increased electricity prices, causing a double burden for the population already suffering the severe impacts of air pollution. If the 500 megawatt Plomin C coal plant is realised, studies project that it will cause the premature deaths of 680 people."" During actions taking place today in Paris, Zagreb and on social networks, the groups will call on Crédit Agricole to immediately withdraw from the Plomin C project. In Paris, the Young Friends of the Earth have organised a press conference within the premises of a Crédit Agricole bank warning of the health impacts of the project, with photos of the people who will be affected if Plomin C goes ahead. In Zagreb, activists from Zelena Istra, Friends of the Earth Croatia and Greenpeace are gathering in front of the French embassy in order to call on France's public and private bodies to stop all support to fossil fuels.

",UK government highlights opposition to GCM Resources plan for Bangladesh coal mine,,,Phulbari coal mine ,mining - coal ,Bangladesh,"
The UK government has published a statement today that highlights the fierce opposition to British company GCM Resources' plans for a massive open cast coal mine in Phulbari, north-west Bangladesh. The statement notes protestors ""calling strikes, blockading roads and occupying the company's local offices"".
GCM's planned Phulbari coal mine has provoked repeated protests by local people. Three people were killed and many more injured when paramilitary officers opened fire on a demonstration against the project in 2006. Protests in 2013 and 2014 forced the company's CEO Gary Lye to abandon visits to the area.
The government's statement expresses ""regret"" that the company had failed to update its plans or produce a human rights impact assessment for the project, as recommended in the findings of its investigation under the OECD Guidelines on Multinational Enterprises, which were published in November 2014.
Campaigners in Bangladesh say that any moves by GCM to move forward with the project, including by updating its plans, would provoke further resistance. They are demanding the company's complete withdrawal from the project.
The UK government's investigation, which followed a complaint submitted by the Global Justice Now and International Accountability Project in 2012, condemned the company for breaching international guidelines on ethical corporate behaviour, stating that the project ""has aroused considerable opposition in Bangladesh, leading to violent protests, and an even more violent response by the authorities there"".
Today's statement also notes ministers and officials in the Bangladesh Government who say that GCM does not have a valid contract with them, and that they have no intention of letting open cast coal extraction take place in the region, which includes some of the country's best agricultural land. These statements follow demands made by protesters against the project that the Bangladesh government should ban open cast mining and remove GCM from the country.
Christine Haigh, campaigner at Global Justice Now, said:

""Today's statement is further evidence that the Phulbari coal mine cannot go ahead. If it does, it will be a human rights disaster. Local people have repeatedly made it clear that they don't want it and any moves by GCM to move this project forward will be met by further resistance.""
""While GCM are claiming this report vindicates them, in reality it does anything but. The main problem is the inability of the British government to enforce human rights standards on companies like GCM, leaving people affected by British companies around the world with no right to legal redress for the injustices they face. This must change.""

The mine would force up to 220,000 people from their land, destroying their homes and livelihoods, and would threaten the Sundarbans - one of the world's largest remaining mangrove forests and a UNESCO World Heritage site. The UK government states that GCM must take into account the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which stipulates that no developments can take place on indigenous peoples' land without their ‘free, prior and informed consent'. Bangladesh's National Indigenous Union says the mine would displace or impoverish 50,000 indigenous people from 23 villages. Seven UN human rights experts have called for an immediate halt to the project, citing threats to fundamental human rights, including the rights to water, food, adequate housing, freedom from extreme poverty and the rights of indigenous peoples. For more information contact Global Justice Now on 07711 875 345.

Nijmegen ",First six banks sign Paris Pledge to avoid finance for coal,ASN Bank ,Netherlands,,,,"
With three months to go before the start of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris (COP 21), six banks have become the first to sign the Paris Pledge to avoid financing the coal industry, including coal mining and power. The banks are ASN Bank from the Netherlands; Banco Fie from Bolivia; Ekobanken from Sweden; New Resource Bank from California; and Ethikbank and Umweltbank from Germany.  All have confirmed to BankTrack their commitment to ""continue to avoid financing coal mining and coal power, and to support the financing of renewable energy and energy efficiency.""  These banks, which already avoid financing coal mining and power, are the first to respond to the call from more than 100 organisations and over 1100 individuals from around the world, all of whom have given their support to the Paris Pledge campaign since its launch in July. The Paris Pledge campaign is aimed at ending the multi-billion dollar coal financing of the world's private banks, and is backed by leaders of the fossil fuel divestment movement including 350.org and its founder Bill McKibben, as well as urgewald, Friends of the Earth France, Greenpeace International and Rainforest Action Network. Catalina von Hildebrand, BankTrack's Paris Pledge campaign coordinator, commented: ""Bravo to ASN, Banco Fie, Ekobanken, Ethikbank, New Resource Bank and Umweltbank for committing to finance the vital transition to low-carbon energy. The only way for any bank to genuinely do this is to say goodbye to coal and other fossil fuel investments for good. These banks are sending a strong message ahead of COP 21 that bank portfolios need to be rapidly scrubbed clean of all fossil fuel financing, and we encourage others to join them. ""But of course the much greater challenge is to the large multinational banks who are the major bankers of the coal industry, providing a vital life-line to the dirtiest of the fossil fuels. We're inviting these banks to show they also recognise the urgent challenges of climate change, and sign up to the Pledge by committing to produce a phase-out plan for their coal finance."" BankTrack is calling upon all private sector banks to do the Paris Pledge, including 91 of the world's heaviest coal financiers.

London ",Major UK bank ditches giant coal mine threatening Great Barrier Reef,Standard Chartered ,United Kingdom,Carmichael coal mine project ,mining - coal  | transport and infrastructure,Australia,"
A major UK bank has announced today it is pulling out of one of the world's most controversial coal developments following an international campaign by Greenpeace and others. UK-based international bank Standard Chartered has become the second financial institutional in the space of just a few days to walk away from the proposed Carmichael mega coal mine in Queensland, Australia.   The prominent bank has been the leading financial adviser to the companies planning to dig Australia's largest coal mine. A vast coalition of environmental campaigners has warned the development could threaten the Great Barrier Reef and set off a carbon time bomb. Only last week, Greenpeace UK's executive director John Sauven wrote to the bank's bosses asking them to come clean about their current role. Today, a Standard Chartered spokesperson told Greenpeace UK that they will no longer provide financial advice to the project. Greenpeace has welcomed the decision by Standard Chartered to end their involvement with the Carmichael coal mine. ""This is a victory for anyone who cares about the future of both the Great Barrier Reef and the world's efforts to tackle climate change,"" said Greenpeace campaigner Sebastian Bock. ""Getting anywhere near this controversial project is now a massive reputational risk even for some of the world's most powerful banks. The Australian government should now take notice and rethink their support for one of the most environmentally destructive fossil fuel developments in the world."" Standard Chartered's move is the third blow to the Carmichael mine in just a few days. Last week, the federal court of Australia overturned the government approval for the mine. Just hours later the Commonwealth Bank of Australia announced it was walking away from the venture.  Carmichael would be Australia's largest coal mine and one of the largest in the world. On the doorstep of the Great Barrier Reef, it would require massive seafloor dredging and port expansion, resulting in hundreds more coal ships sailing through Reef waters. At 28,000 hectares, it would also produce 121 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions yearly at maximum production driving climate change - the greatest threat to the Reef.     "

There's no excuse for a failure to act on land grabs.
Since Oxfam revealed the links between Australia's biggest 
banks and companies implicated in agriculture land grabbing in emerging markets, 
Westpac and National Australia Bank have both moved to improve their record, 
while ANZ and Commonwealth Bank have totally failed to clean up their act.
But, so far, none of the big four have gone far enough to 
support land rights.
Today Oxfam has released a briefing paper for the Australian 
financial sector. The paper outlines in technical detail how exactly banks can 
enact a Zero Tolerance for Land Grabs approach and ensure that they're not 
profiting from companies that destroy the lives of communities overseas.
In showing the big four banks a roadmap for action, Oxfam is 
also putting the banks on notice.

",Commonwealth pulls out of Carmichael mega-mine,Commonwealth Bank ,Australia,Carmichael coal mine project ,mining - coal  | transport and infrastructure,Australia,"
After months of sustained community pressure, Commonwealth Bank has ended its role as advisor to Adani's Carmichael coal project. Fairfax last night reported that the bank cited environmental factors and financial risks as the reasons for breaking ties with the project.

CLICK TO SHARE ON FACEBOOK
The decision is a massive blow to the Indian company's prospects, as they now face the unenviable - and potentially impossible - task of raising the Carmichael project's required $16 billion worth of funding without CommBank's support.
""As an adviser, Commonwealth Bank was in line to be a leading lender to Adani's Carmichael mega coal mine,"" explains our executive director Julien Vincent.
""Adani has not just lost hundreds of millions of dollars in debt finance that CBA could have brought, but the credibility that a major Australian institution brought to the project too.""
The Carmichael mega mine, the largest in the Southern Hemisphere, would export coal from Queensland's Galilee Basin via a new export terminal at Abbot Point in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. Earlier this year, we revealed that CommBank had been the biggest lender to fossil fuel projects in the Reef since 2008, and the second biggest lender to fossil fuels in Australia. So this news comes as a welcome relief to all those who have been working tirelessly to safeguard the Reef from the ravages of further industrialisation.
Concerns over the impacts that CommBank's lending practices were having on the Reef, as well as our land, water, health and climate have caused many former customers to publicly cut ties with the bank, and this latest development is a huge win for those who have taken a stand and told Commbank: ""Not with my money!""
The bank now joins eleven other major banks that have ruled out funding all or part of the Galilee coal supply chain. However, ANZ, NAB and Westpac all remain as possible financiers of Carmichael and other proposed Galilee coal projects, meaning that our job is not yet done.

 
Please take the a moment to email the other big Aussie banks, telling them to keep up with the pack and rule out lending to Galilee coal project - click the image above or go to marketforces.org.au/galileecoal to take action.
It is important at this stage to remember that CommBank is still the second biggest lender to fossil fuel projects in Australia, and lends $13 to the sector for every $1 lent to renewables.
So while it is great to celebrate this win after so much effort and we can congratulate CommBank on finally making the right decision, we must also call on them to go further.
You can send the bank an email, congratulating them and at the same time asking for a clear statement that they will end lending to dirty fossil fuel projects and support the development of Australia's renewable energy sector. "

",The Financial Sector and Japan's Corporate Governance Code,,,,,,"
Most banks don't require proof that their clients in the tropical timber, palm oil or pulp and paper sectors have the legal right to clear forest. They don't require proof that the rights of affected Indigenous Peoples or other forest-dependent communities are respected. And they almost certainly won't make loans conditional on any robust environmental standards.
As absurd as it sounds, this is standard practice for banks with clients in the business of clearing tropical rainforests. With little more than a claim to a patch of forest, some collateral, and a list of willing clients to sell to, a company finds it all too easy to finance deforestation. RAN believes it's time to stop big banks from bankrolling forest destruction and associated human rights abuses.
One of the largest sources of loans to companies engaged in tropical deforestation is Japan's banking sector. But the tide may be turning. In June 2015, Japan's new Corporate Governance Code (the Code) came into effect, which requires Tokyo-listed companies, including Japan's major banks, to begin to disclose and address the range of environmental, social and governance problems they face.
RAN has produced guidance for Japan's financial institutions in translating this new policy into practice. Companies causing forest destruction and rights violations should not be bankrolled anymore. RAN is calling on all banks, including Japan's banking sector, to develop strong forest sector safeguard policies and systems so that only genuinely responsible forest sector clients can get bank loans.

London ",Banks and dirty money,,,,,,"
Corruption is a major problem which has a devastating human cost. In poor countries it kills people and traps millions more in poverty. It also undermines the global economy and threatens national security, affecting all countries.
The largely hidden truth is that banks play an integral role in enabling this. Corrupt officials need somewhere to hide stolen money. Yet while laws and regulations apply in most countries  which require banks to do a range of checks to detect the proceeds of the corruption, many banks fail to uphold them. As result they are leaving the door wide open for corrupt people to launder their funds.
Banks and Dirty Money reveals the skewed incentives which lie at the root of this problem. It shows that the best solution is for senior executives to be held personally responsible when banks break the rules, and that without this banks will continue to enable corruption and the harm that results.     "

Nijmegen, The Netherlands ",BankTrack launches ‘Paris Pledge’ campaign,,,,,,"
A major international coalition of campaign
groups is today launching a campaign calling on banks to publicly pledge to end
their multi-billion dollar financing for the coal industry, ahead of the UN
Climate Summit in Paris. The campaign is coordinated by BankTrack, the bank
campaign organisation, and is supported by over 40 environmental and
campaigning groups including Avaaz, Friends of the Earth US, Global Justice
Now, Global Witness, Greenpeace International, Market Forces, Rainforest Action
Network and the Sierra Club.   The Paris Pledge campaign is asking all private sector banks to make a public
commitment to phase out their financing of both coal power and coal mining,
before the start of the UN climate summit in Paris at the end of November.    Johan Frijns, BankTrack's director, commented on the Paris Pledge campaign
launch: ""The burning of coal is the single biggest source of carbon
emissions, leading to already ongoing and increasingly catastrophic climate
change. To stay within the 2 degrees temperature threshold, the use of coal
must come to an end. However, bank finance is continuing to provide
the coal industry with last-gasp life support. BankTrack's latest research
uncovered $500 billion in financing flowing from more than 90 international
private banks to the coal sector in the period 2005-2014.   ""Fortunately, we see signs that banks are beginning to understand that the
days of coal are over. Many ethical banks are ahead and already do not finance
coal, while Bank of America and Crédit Agricole have made commitments to pull
out of the coal mining sector. Barclays, ING and Natixis have put an end to
their financing of Mountaintop Removal coal mining. Deutsche Bank, HSBC,
RBS, Barclays, Citi, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, BNP
Paribas, Crédit Agricole and Société Générale have all ruled out financing
coal infrastructure projects that threaten the Great Barrier reef, while
recently the largest French banks also refused to finance the Rampal coal
project in Bangladesh.   ""This is all very encouraging but not enough. It's perfect timing ahead of
the Paris climate summit to ramp up public pressure and get banks to pledge to
quit financing coal altogether.""   Catalina von Hildebrand, coordinator of the Paris Pledge campaign added: ""We're
asking banks to ""do the Paris Pledge"" and commit now to publish a detailed plan
to phase out coal finance, no later than six months after the Paris Summit. We
also invite banks that have already quit coal to join us by pledging to keep
their funds out of the sector. By signing this Pledge, banks will show that
they are ready to take the concrete steps necessary to reduce their fossil fuel
finance, and they will be helping build momentum to support a strong deal for
the climate in Paris.""   In the coming months, BankTrack and campaign partners will seek massive support
for the call for banks to sign the Pledge. Organisations and members of the
public can support the call atdotheparispledge.org.  Notes for editors   1. The Paris Pledge website contains the text of the Paris Pledge text for
banks to sign, provides an opportunity for individuals and organisations to
support the campaign and contains further background information and resources

Bonn, Germany ",New UNESCO warning to potential financiers of Rampal coal plant,,,Rampal coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Bangladesh,"
The UNESCO World Heritage Committee at its annual meeting in Bonn has yet again criticised the Bangladeshi government for failing to evaluate the impacts of the proposed Rampal coal plant on the Sundarbans World Heritage Site. In a blow to prospects for the coal plant, the Committee requested the Bangladeshi government invite a monitoring mission to the site, the first step towards placing the property on the World Heritage in Danger list. 

 

The World Heritage Committee decision is a further setback to the Rampal project promoters, a consortium comprising India's National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) and Bangladesh's Power Development Board, as they seek project finance of over $1 billion from international lenders. NTPC has already this year suffered a $56 million divestment from Norway's Global Pension Fund specifically on account of the risks of ""severe environmental damage"" that the Rampal project could inflict on the Sundarbans.

 

The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world and forms a natural fence protecting the coastal belt areas of Bangladesh. It is estimated that over one million people depend on the Sundarbans for their livelihood, many of whom work seasonally as fishermen. The coal-based thermal power plant at Rampal will be located just 14 kilometres upstream of the Sundarbans Reserve Forest. The Bangladeshi government has justified the location of the project on the grounds that it is at a ‘safe' distance from the mangrove forest.

 
""This decision by the World Heritage Committee demonstrates how deeply concerned the Committee is about the potential impacts of the Rampal coal plant on the Sundarbans World Heritage Site,"" said Yann Louvel of BankTrack. ""It should be an alarm call for international banks that may be considering financing the coal plant.  The Rampal coal plant has potential to cause serious damage to the world's largest mangrove forest and one of the last remaining habitats for the Bengal tiger.""

 

Last year the World Heritage Committee expressed concern about the proposed construction of the Rampal plant at Khulna, in particular citing the lack of an assessment of the impacts of the proposed coal plant on the World Heritage Site and requesting the Bangladesh government to undertake a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) ""to ensure that cumulative impacts of developments in Sundarbans are adequately assessed"". 

 

While the Bangladesh government submitted a report in February this year to the committee as requested, this year's UNESCO World Heritage Committee decision notes the ongoing lack of an SEA or other detailed studies on the likely impacts of the Rampal plant and other industrial activities on the World Heritage property. The Committee urges the government ""to ensure activities  are not conducted before the revised EIA is submitted to the World Heritage Centre and reviewed by IUCN.""

 

The decision further requests the Bangladesh government to invite a monitoring mission to the Sundarbans in order ""to review the state of conservation of the property, and the potential impacts of the thermal power plant development and dredging of Pashur River"". Such a monitoring mission is the first step towards placing a property on the World Heritage in Danger list.

 
Yann Louvel continued: ""The committee's view is a strong reminder to banks that there are huge, irreversible social and environmental risks involved in the Rampal project and that, worryingly, the project promoters and the Bangladesh and Indian governments are taking an overly relaxed approach to safeguarding the Sundarbans.

 
""With the project now desperate for financing, and efforts being ramped up to secure international lenders in the coming weeks, we're calling on other banks to follow the example recently set by three top French banks and declare that they're steering clear of Sundarbans devastation.""

 

In May, France's three largest banks, BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole and Société Génerale, disclosed that they will not finance the Rampal project due to incompatibility with their policies and ""the risks associated with the project"". A recently published BankTrack study has revealed that the potential environmental damage posed by the Rampal project means that it would breach many provisions of the Equator Principles, a set of social and environmental guidelines for project finance followed by 80 banks around the world.

Nijmegen ",Bangladesh coal plant “non-compliant with Equator Principles” shows new BankTrack analysis,BNP Paribas ,France,Rampal coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Bangladesh,"
As the UNESCO World Heritage Committee
meets this week in Bonn, Germany, a new report from BankTrack shows that the Rampal coal power plant, proposed
for construction on the edge of the World Heritage Sundarbans mangrove forest
in Bangladesh, would breach the Equator Principles, a set of guidelines for
project finance followed by 80 banks around the world.
The report was published at the same time
as a report in the Guardian newspaper which revealed that the three largest French banks, BNP
Paribas, Crédit Agricole and Société Génerale, have said they will not finance
the Rampal project. The move comes six months after two Norwegian pension funds
withdrew from India's National Thermal Power Corporation, one of the companies
involved in developing the plant.
""The analysis shows that serious
deficiencies in project design, planning, and implementation and due diligence
obligations render the project non-compliant with the minimum social and
environmental standards established by the Equator Principles, as well as the
International Finance Corporation's Performance Standards,"" states the
report.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove
forest in the world and forms a natural fence protecting the coastal belt areas
of Bangladesh. It is estimated that over one million people depend on the Sundarbans
for their livelihood, many of whom work seasonally as fishermen. The coal-based
thermal power plant at Rampal will be located just 14 kilometres upstream of
the Sundarbans Reserve Forest. The Bangladeshi government has justified the
location of the project on the ground that it is at a ‘safe' distance from the
mangrove forest.
BankTrack has assumed the Equator
Principles apply to the Rampal coal plant as the project proponents are seeking
project finance to proceed, total project capital costs far exceed the US $10
million threshold for application of the principles, and most importantly, because
the project poses significant adverse social and environmental risks and
impacts that are diverse and irreversible.
BankTrack is calling on the Equator
Principles financial institutions (EPFIs) to follow the French banks and
publicly rule out involvement in financing or support of any kind for the
Rampal coal plant. ""The failure to comply with these minimum standards are
indicative of the social, environmental and financial risks the Rampal coal
plant poses and make the project a clear ""no-go"" for EPFIs,"" states the report. "

Melbourne ",Australian banks: New Report highlights gulf between renewable and fossil fuel financing,ANZ ,Australia,Great Barrier Reef Coal & Gas Exports ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,Australia,"
A new report from Market Forces shines a light for the first time on Australian banks' financing of the fossil fuel industry and the disparity between lending to ‘clean' and ‘dirty' energy.
Covering over 150 financial institutions, the report - Fueling the Fire - identifies ANZ as the leading lender to fossil fuels, having provided $12.6 billion to coal, oil and gas in Australia since 2008.
With Commonwealth bank loaning $9.9 billion, National Australia Bank $8.3 billion and Westpac $5.9 billion, Australia's ""big four"" banks have lent $36.7 billion to the fossil fuel sector in Australia since 2008. This accounts for over a quarter of the $135 billion made in loans to the sector since that date.
""This report leaves no doubt that Australia's big banks are the lynchpin of major fossil fuel projects in Australia. With the ‘big four' involved in three quarters of the deals to take place in the sector, it's highly unlikely that any major polluting project could go ahead without their investment"", said Market Forces Lead Campaigner Julien Vincent.
The report also compares the big four banks' lending to renewable energy against its support for fossil fuels. For every dollar loaned to renewable energy, the ""big four"" loaned an average of $6 to fossil fuels. Commonwealth Bank performed the worst of the big four, lending thirteen times as much to fossil fuels between 2008 and 2014 as it did to renewable energy.
""Banks have a pivotal role to play in driving our economy to one that is less carbon intensive, but despite the fact that globally, investment in new renewable energy is outstripping that for fossil fuels, Australian banks remain heavily skewed in favour of greenhouse intensive projects,"" said Vincent.
""That our own money is being used to sabotage our future will come as a shock to the overwhelming majority of Australians who want to see action on climate change and icons such as the Great Barrier Reef protected from proposed new coal export projects. While the banks publicly herald their sustainability credentials, their lending practices tell an entirely different story.""
The report also highlights the increasing risk of exposure to potential stranded assets in the fossil fuel sector.
""Examples such as the $900 million sunk by the big four into Wiggins Island Coal Export Terminal demonstrate that the risk profile of fossil fuel projects is heightening,"" said Vincent. ""The likelihood for assets to become stranded means the risks of investment are becoming as much financial as environmental. This should surely at the centre of any potential funding decisions by banks with regards to the Galilee Basin and its associated infrastructure.""

Stockholm ",Swedish banks in breach of human rights guidelines,Nordea ,Finland,Royal Dutch Shell ,oil and gas,Netherlands,"
Swedish banks invest in companies involved in serious
human rights abuses, according to a new report. The report also shows that the
banks' justification - to engage with companies to bring about a change - in
many cases is very weak. 
The report written by Amnesty International in Sweden
and the Swedish Consumers' Association and published by Fair Finance Guide
examines banks' investments in companies linked to human rights abuses. The
report shows that the seven largest banks in Sweden invest in companies
involved in human rights abuses, even though this goes against the principles
that the banks commit to in their policies. Furthermore, five of the seven
banks have major shortcomings in their engagement dialogues.
""The banks justify their investments by saying they
engage with the companies in order to prevent or mitigate human rights abuses.
But many of the engagement dialogues put no real pressure on companies, so they
become a fake alibi to continue investing"", says Kathleen McCaughey, Business
and Human Rights officer at the Swedish section of Amnesty International.
The report is based on an analysis of the investments
through the banks' mutual funds in a sample of four companies whose involvement
in serious human rights abuses have been documented by Amnesty for years. These
include Dow Chemical, whose subsidiary is at the heart of the world's worst
industrial disaster of our time where the people of Bhopal are still waiting
for justice after 30 years. All banks also own shares in Shell, responsible for
huge oil spills in the Niger Delta.
""If banks and other investors put proper pressure on
companies many of the problems would be addressed, the owners decide how
companies should act"", says Kathleen McCaughey.
The report examines whether the banks investment
practices and engagement live up to its own policies as surveyed by Fair
Finance Guide earlier this year. The results show major shortcomings in the
investment practices and engagement of Danske Bank, Handelsbanken, Nordea, SEB and Skandia, while Länsförsäkringar and Swedbank demonstrated fewer
shortcomings.
""We hope that the banks take responsibility for human
rights in all their investments. It is not acceptable to, for example, invest
in a company like Shell, which has destroyed the lives of hundreds of thousands
of people for over 60 years in the Niger Delta, without actively trying to
influence the company"", says Kathleen McCaughey. "

London ",Pressure builds for UK’s Standard Chartered to refuse investment to Great Barrier Reef coal project,Standard Chartered ,United Kingdom,Carmichael coal mine project ,mining - coal  | transport and infrastructure,Australia,"
Civil society groups are this week ramping up public pressure on Standard Chartered Bank to end its involvement with a controversial Australian mining project. Groups including Greenpeace, 350.org and SumOfUs  have launched a joint effort calling for Standard Chartered to rule out finance for the Carmichael mega mine and any coal projects associated with port expansion on the Great Barrier Reef, with activities kicking off in Europe, Asia and Australia. The Carmichael coal mine would be one of the biggest mines in the world and by far the biggest coal mine ever built in Australia.
The mines would also require construction of one of the world's largest coal ports, on the Great Barrier Reef - the largest living coral system in the world. The Carmichael mine alone would release more emissions than New Zealand and Sweden combined.
Three weeks ago, organisations* representing almost 50 million members, sent a joint letter to Standard Chartered, calling on them to rule out involvement in the mines and port expansion. With little indication that their concerns have been heeded, NGOs are now calling upon hundreds of thousands of their supporters to petition the Bank and email its CEO.
""These projects will wreck one of the world's most precious natural icons and send the mercury soaring to dangerous levels. It behoves Standard Chartered to join the 11 major global banks who have already ruled out involvement in these disastrous projects,"" said Charlie Wood, Campaigns Director with 350.org Australia
""By ending its role as an active advisor on the project, Standard Chartered has the unique chance to protect the climate and the Reef by stopping one of the planet's biggest and most destructive coal projects from seeing the light of day,"" said Sebastian Bock, Investment Campaigner with Greenpeace UK
""The Reef is already under huge pressure from climate change. The last thing it needs is a massive new coal port and armada of  ships traipsing across its waters. Our supporters are urging Standard Chartered not to be the bank that puts the final nail in the coffin of one of the world's most precious natural icons,"" said Katherine Tu, Campaigner with SumOfUs.
""Either Standard Chartered gets its brand out of this mess or it will continue to face a creative and unrelenting campaign led by hundreds of thousands of people around the world who want our Banks to say no to financing Reef and climate destruction,"" concluded Wood.
A 2015 report ranked the Abbot Point project the third biggest threat to corporate reputation of any project currently progressing globally (from 12,000 assessed). A recent court case in Queensland revealed that Standard Chartered had previously provided a loan of $680 million to the controversial Carmichael Mine and Rail Project -  the first to be moving ahead in exploiting the Galilee Basin's coal reserves. While the bank disputes this, Standard Chartered has not publicly explained where that money has come from.
*Signatories to the letter include: Greenpeace, Avaaz, 350.org, The Sierra Club, SumOfUs, 38 Degrees, Rainforest Action Network, BankTrack, The Australian Youth Climate Coalition, Whitsunday Residents Against Dumping and Dredging, The Mackay Conservation Council, Friends of the Earth United States, Friends of the Earth Australia and Market Forces
A BankTrack analysis published today shows that Standard Chartered will 
only be able to involve itself in the financing of these projects by 
contravening its own guidelines.     "

Nijmegen ",APRIL announces new sustainability policy after campaign pressure on its financiers,ABN AMRO ,Netherlands,APRIL ,forestry - pulp and paper,Indonesia,"

Last week the Indonesian pulp and paper company
Asia Pacific Resources International Ltd (APRIL) announced a new Sustainable
Forest Management Policy which includes an immediate moratorium on logging
in natural forests. The move comes after an intensive campaign by a group of
environmental organisations, focused on pressuring both the company and its
financiers to address the company's long standing social and environmental
conflicts.
Of the three major European banks known to
be financing APRIL, two announced earlier this year that they would not provide
the company with any new loans unless it significantly improved its policy and
procedures. The Spanish bank Santander was the first to announce this in
February, after receiving a Greenpeace petition with more than 145,000 signatures.
Two weeks later ABN AMRO followed with a similar statement. The third bank, Credit Suisse, did not make
any such statement and remained prepared to finance APRIL, despite extensive
lobbying from an alliance of NGOs at its AGM, and a BankTrack analysis showing that
the bank was breaching its policies and procedures in financing the company.
Campaigners cautiously welcomed the new
policy, but emphasised that changes must now be seen on the ground before it
can be judged successful .
Woro Supartinah, Coorindator of Jikalahari,
a Sumatra based network of NGOs, said that APRIL's revised new policy ""remains
weak from some aspects such as peat protection and restoration of damaged peat
forest, while it is also not showing a strong willingness to solve community
conflict."" ""We remain in doubt that APRIL will stop clearing peat forest,
especially on Pulau Padang"", she continued.
Lafcadio Cortesi, Asia Director with
Rainforest Action Network, said: ""APRIL's policy commitment must be supported
by a transparent, time bound implementation road map, decisive actions and
independent monitoring and verification of outcomes on the ground. This would
mark a significant contribution to the conservation of Indonesia's rainforests
and respect for local communities and their rights.""
""We commend APRIL for agreeing to end its
deforestation, although we will be watching closely to make sure that today's
announcement leads to real change on the ground,"" said Bustar Maitar, Head of
Greenpeace's Forest Campaign in Indonesia. ""Today's commitment from APRIL and
the RGE Group is yet more proof that forest protection is the way forward for
plantation companies in Indonesia.""
""Those banks that withdrew from financing APRIL
while it remained involved in deforestation sent clear signals to the company
that it needed to clean up its act"", said BankTrack's forests campaigner, Merel
van de Mark. ""However, true proof of APRIL's commitment lies in the full
implementation of its policy, which will need time to evaluate. The company has
broken its own policies before, so financiers are advised to keep monitoring
APRIL closely. Furthermore, the banks which financed APRIL should review their
own policies and due diligence processes to ensure they avoid financing
companies involved in large scale deforestation and numerous social conflicts
in future.""

Amsterdam ","Bank Transparency still very low, warns Fair Finance Guide in new report",,,,,,"
The civil society network Fair Finance Guide International and its seven members today launched a report on Transparency and Accountability in the Financial Sector. The report examines key aspects relating to transparency and accountability, and to reporting about tax related issues, as they apply to 47 banks in the seven countries where FFG is active.
The report assesses and scores the 47 banks on their transparency and accountability by looking at four key aspects: publication of policies and risk management; disclosure of investments; reporting on engagement with companies and voting behaviour; and stakeholder dialogue. The report also scores those banks on their transparency on tax-related issues, including the extent to which they provide detailed, country-by-country information on key indicators on transparency and tax. 
The report is based on a methodology developed by the Fair Finance Guide, in collaboration with research organisation Profundo. Research and analysis was conducted by the Fair Finance Guide members in Belgium, Brazil, France, Indonesia, Japan, the Netherlands and Sweden. In addition to country chapters, the report contains contributions from key experts, presenting a range of perspectives on strengthening transparency and accountability in the financial sector.
""Transparency is the fundamental condition for a financial and banking sector that sees itself accountable to society, not above it"" said Ted van Hees, the Chair of the Fair Finance Guide network. ""The choice of this theme for the first joint case study produced by the members of FFG aims to improve bank policies at their core, leaving no room for opacity or exemptions"".
The report places assessed banks in three categories: leaders, followers and laggards. Only three banks scored above six out of ten on FFG's Transparency and Accountability theme, earning their place in the category of leaders: ASN Bank in the Netherlands, which scored 8.1 points, followed by CitiBank (as for Indonesia of this US-based bank, 6.8) and Van Lanschot, which operates in the Netherlands and Belgium (6.1). 
Twenty eight banks, constituting almost 60 percent of the banks included in the research, scored below four points out of ten on this theme. That such a large percentage of banks are laggards in their transparency and accountability reporting is of serious concern. 
A second set of scores presented in the report relate to transparency on taxation. With increasing public demand for combating tax abuses, and moves to tighten international rules in this regard, the Fair Finance Guide highlights how banks are performing in this extremely important area. The scores on taxation transparency are based on the banks' 2013 Annual Reports, before the first obligations to report country-by-country on tax payments came into effect in Europe in 2014. 
The scores on the theme Taxes and Corruption yield four banks as leaders in this field, with ASN Bank in the Netherlands scoring highest with 9.3 points out of ten. It is joined by SNS Reaal and NIBC in the Netherlands (6.9 and 6.2 points respectively), and by VDK in Belgium (6.8 points).
Thirty six of the banks assessed in the report are laggards in tax transparency, which is a worryingly overwhelming 77 percent of the total.
""The aim of Fair Finance Guide is to promote a race to the top among financial institutions in their policies and practices,"" said Imad Sabi, the Methodology and Research Coordinator in FFG. ""We want this report on transparency and accountability to highlight where banks are and to set demands and expectations in this regard"".

Kiad, Panama/Amsterdam/Bogota ",Independent report: Dutch and German development banks failed to comply with environmental and human rights standards in financing the Barro Blanco dam in Panama,FMO ,Netherlands,Barro Blanco dam project ,energy plants - dams,Panama,"
Last Friday, a long-awaited report by an independent panel, found that FMO and DEG, the Dutch and German development banks, violated their own policies by failing to adequately assess the risks to indigenous rights and the environment before approving a US$50 million loan to GENISA, the developer of the Barro Blanco hydroelectric project in Panama. FMO and DEG's response to the findings, while acknowledging some deficiencies in their assessment, does not commit to any measures to address the outstanding policy violations. Even while the report concludes that ""the lenders have not taken the resistance of the affected communities seriously enough,"" it appears that FMO and DEG continue to do so.
No 'Free, Prior and Informed Consent'
In May 2014, the Movimiento 10 de Abril (M-10), representing indigenous peoples directly affected by the project, with the support of Both ENDS and SOMO, filed the first complaint to the Independent Complaints Mechanism (ICM) of the FMO and DEG. The complaint alleges that the Barro Blanco dam will affect part of the Ngöbe-Buglé indigenous territory, flooding their homes, schools, and religious, archaeological, and cultural sites. Despite national and international human rights obligations, the Panamanian government, GENISA and the banks failed to obtain the free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) of the Ngöbe-Buglé before the project was approved. The ICM found that the ""lenders should have sought greater clarity on whether there was consent to the project from the appropriate indigenous authorities prior to project approval.""
""Stop the project""
""We did not give our consent to this project before it was approved, and it does not have our consent today,"" said Manolo Miranda, a representative of the M-10.  ""We demand that the government, GENISA, and the banks respect our rights and stop this project.""
The ICM found that ""while the  agreement was reached prior to significant construction, significant issues related to social and environmental impact and, in particular, issues related to the rights of indigenous peoples were not completely assessed prior to the  agreement."" The banks' failure to identify the potential impacts of the project led to a subsequent failure to require their client to take any action to mitigate those impacts. The environmental and social action plan (ESAP) appended to the loan agreement ""contains no provision on land acquisition and resettlement and nothing on biodiversity and natural resources management. Neither does it contain any reference to issues related to cultural heritage."" 
Failure
""This failure constitutes a violation of international standards regarding the obligation to elaborate adequate and comprehensive Environmental and Social Impact Assessments before implementing any development project, in order to guarantee the right to free, prior and informed consent, information and effective participation of the potentially affected community"", explained Ana María Mondragón, lawyer at the Interamerican Association for Environmental Defense (AIDA).
While FMO and DEG acknowledged in their official response to the ICM's report that they ""were not fully appraised at credit approval,"" they made no further concrete commitments to ensure that the rights of those affected by the dam will be respected.  The banks claim that they are ""facing limitations in their influence"" over government processes to come to a satisfactory agreement with all stakeholders involved. Their actions, however, reveal a different story. 
Dialogue
In February, the Panamanian government provisionally suspended construction of the Barro Blanco dam. Subsequent to the suspension, the government convened a dialogue table with the Ngöbe-Buglé, with the facilitation of the United Nations, to discuss the future of the project. Rather than encouraging the Government of Panama to respect the rights of the Ngöbe-Buglé, FMO and DEG have requested that Panama's environmental authority reconsider the suspension and allow their client to resume construction.  In February, they sent a letter to the Vice President of Panama, expressing their ""great concern and consternation"" about the suspension and noting that it ""may weigh upon future investment decisions, and harm the flow of long-term investments into Panama."" 
Independent investigation
While the banks asserted that their consultants found nothing that would warrant the suspension of the project, they failed to mention that their own independent accountability mechanism was undertaking an investigation of the project.  Indeed, by that time, the banks had already seen a draft of the ICM's report with findings that the project was not in compliance with its own policies. 
""We were surprised to find out about the role of the banks in influencing the national process, as this is in contradiction to their assertions that they are not in a position to intervene in national decision-making."" said Anouk Franck, senior policy advisor at Both ENDS, based in Amsterdam. ""They should now show their commitment in coming to a solution and start taking FPIC seriously, in the case of Barro Blanco, where due to delays in tackling the issue, the banks might need to accept losses on their loan. And they need to find ways to assure themselves FPIC is obtained where relevant, for example through human rights impact assessments.""
Secret agreement
The handling of the complaint was a lengthy and at times frustrating process. GENISA refused to cooperate with the ICM and provide them with access to project documents, leading the banks to conclude a secret side agreement with GENISA. The secret side agreement superseded the publicly available procedures of the ICM and allowed GENISA to review the draft and final investigation reports before they were shared with complainants. 
""FMO and DEG are more concerned with protecting the interests of their client than they are with protecting the rights of those affected by the projects they finance,"" said Kris Genovese, senior researcher at the Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (SOMO).  ""It's a tragic irony that banks asked the consent of the company to publish the ICM's investigation report, but didn't ask consent of Ngöbe-Buglé for the project.""
Clean development? 
The Barro Blanco project was registered under the Clean Development Mechanism, a system under the Kyoto Protocol that allows the crediting of emission reductions from greenhouse gas abatement projects in developing countries.
""As climate finance flows are expected to flow through various channels in the future, the lessons of Barro Blanco must be taken very seriously. To prevent that future climate mitigation projects have negative impacts, a strong institutional safeguard system that respects all human rights is required,"" said Pierre-Jean Brasier, network coordinator at Carbon Market Watch. ""The opportunity to establish such a necessary safeguards system is now, ahead of the Paris agreement, to put the respect of human rights on top of the UNFCCC agenda.""
The ICM will monitor the banks' implementation of corrective actions and recommendations.  Meanwhile, the M10 expect FMO and DEG to withdrawal their investment from the project and ask that the Dutch and German governments show a public commitment to ensuring the rights of the affected Ngöbe-Buglé. At the same time, the banks should refrain from putting pressure on the Panamanian government.

Nijmegen ","Paris climate summit to be bankrolled by BNP Paribas, top French bank financier of the coal industry",,,,,,"
Today's announcement by the French government that BNP Paribas, the French banking sector's top financier of the coal industry, is to be one of the corporate sponsors of the United Nations climate summit (COP21) in Paris has been strongly criticised by the international bank campaign organisation BankTrack.
BankTrack is calling on the French government and COP21's General Secretariat to reject corporate sponsorship from fossil fuel companies, including banks and investors that keep the fossil fuel sector financially afloat.
Yann Louvel, BankTrack's Climate and Energy coordinator, commented: ""Inviting BNP Paribas to sponsor the UN Climate Summit certainly helps to bail out the bank's carbon-encrusted image, but it sends all the wrong signals about the absolute need to urgently end both fossil fuel use and continued support for this climate-busting sector.
""Not only has BNP Paribas coughed up more than 15 billion euros for the coal industry in the last decade, more than half of the French banking sector's total coal support over this period, but at its recent annual shareholders meeting BNP also ducked the issue of its coal financing and remains as attached as ever to providing the ailing coal industry with financial life support. This is some reward for blatant climate change negligence and stands in contrast with another French bank, Crédit Agricole, which announced last week that it is pulling out of financing for coal mining.""
BankTrack's most recent research into the global banking sector's financial support for the coal sector - both mining and power - has ranked BNP Paribas as the world's number nine coal bank with its support for the sector trending upwards between 2010 and 2013. 
On fossil fuel financing more widely, BNP Paribas has recently acknowledged that the financing of fossil fuels accounts for close to 60 per cent of its overall electricity sector portfolio, while its financing for renewable energy now stands at 23 per cent. 
In partnership with Friends of the Earth France and other French NGOs, politicians and scientists, BankTrack is calling on BNP Paribas to sign the Paris Pledge and to commit before COP21 to quit coal.

Berlin/Cologne ","Deutsche Bank 2015: 'Irresponsible, unlawful, reckless'",Deutsche Bank ,Germany,,,,"
On the occasion of the Annual General
Meeting of Deutsche Bank today, the bank
has been criticised by an alliance of environmental and human rights organisations.
This is due to a complete lack of implementation of its much-vaunted culture change.
Most striking is the bank's completely
ignorant behaviour regarding climate protection and human rights. Deutsche Bank
has for several years been one of the largest funders of global climate
offenders and, in 2014, was the tenth largest financer of coal in the world,
according to the 'Banking on Coal' report .
""Deutsche Bank has continuously made claims that it seeks to
protect the climate. But in reality, it is helping to speed up climate change
and appears unwilling to change even during the Year of Climate 2015,"" said
Katrin Ganswindt of Urgewald.  ""No client
is too controversial and no method too devastating for Deutsche Bank.""
Deutsche Bank still maintains business
relations with corporations like Alpha Natural Resources or Metinvest that mine
coal using the mountaintop removal (MTR) method. As a result of this process
entire mountaintops in the American Appalachian Mountains are blown up to get
to the underlying coal. The method pollutes drinking water and air and leads to
severe health impacts.
Paul Corbit Brown, of Keepers of the
Mountains from the Appalachian Mountains, commented: ""Dozens of banks state
that they will no longer finance corporations specialising in mountaintop
removal, including Barclays, BNP Paribas, RBS, Société Générale, JP Morgan
Chase, Wells Fargo and ING. But Deutsche Bank keeps examining and re-examining
the situation related to divestment and cannot ultimately make up its mind.
It's about time to put the cards on the table and get rid of its MTR clients"".
At the end of January this year, Deutsche Bank,
along with other banks, facilitated the sale of a 10% stake in the coal
corporation Coal India Limited. This company has had serious and sustained
negative publicity related to numerous environmental offences, such as
operating coal mines without environmental permits, serious work accidents, and
disastrous living conditions in coal-mining areas. But the criticisms related
to this client have fallen on deaf ears at Deutsche Bank.
Environmentalists have another of the banks
clients in sight: the Indian National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC). NTPC
plans to construct the Rampal coal-fired power plant  in Bangladesh in a joint venture with the
Bangladesh Power Development Board. 
Rampal will be constructed only 14 kilometres
away from sensitive mangrove forests, which have a UNESCO Natural World
Heritage listing due to their unique characteristics. UNESCO and environmental
experts fear the power plant construction will cause massive damage to the
mangrove forests.
Maha Mirza, of the ""Save the
Sundarbans""project in Bangladesh, said: ""Some international investors such as
the Norwegian Pension Fund Global have removed NTPC from their portfolio due to
the environmental dangers posed by the power plant construction. At the same
time the operators are reaching out to investors and fiscal sponsors for the
Rampal project. We want a clear statement from Deutsche Bank stating that they
will stay out of this business.""
""The commitment by Deutsche Bank to the UN Guiding Principles on
Business and Human Rights can be seen as a farce,"" states Thomas Küchenmeister
of the NGO Facing Finance. He deplores the bank's ignorance regarding human
rights: ""If it is true that respecting human rights is of fundamental concern
for Deutsche Bank, then why does it continue to support business relationships
with some of the most disgraceful arms companies like Heckler & Koch and
Rheinmetall?""
Other clients of this scandalous sector
prone to corruption are nuclear weapons producing BAE Systems, Boeing and
Airbus Group as well as cluster munition producers ATK. All in all, 13
companies producing nuclear weapons were funded with capital through credits
and bonds.

Paris ",Crédit Agricole announces end to global coal mining finance at AGM,Crédit Agricole ,France,Mountain top removal coal mining ,mining - coal ,United States,"
Crédit Agricole announced today at its annual general meeting in Lille that it is ending its multi-million euro funding for coal mining projects and companies. Less than seven months before the United Nations conference on climate change in Paris (COP 21), Crédit Agricole has become the second major bank in the world – after Bank of America  – to cut its funding for the coal mining sector. Friends of the Earth France and BankTrack have welcomed this step forward and now call on Crédit Agricole to deliver in full for the climate by signing the 'Paris Pledge' and thus end completely the bank's support to the coal industry.
Lucie Pinson, private finance campaigner at Friends of the Earth France, commented:
""Following its recent commitment not to finance the Galilee Basin mining projects in Australia , Crédit Agricole now seems on track to establish itself as a leader in the financial sector when it comes to climate policy. The bank's response to our questioning today was certainly more convincing than the responses we've had from Société Générale  or BNP Paribas  at their recent AGMs.""
""By pulling out of coal mining, Crédit Agricole is acknowledging that we must leave 80% of our coal reserves in the ground if we're to keep global warming below 2°C.""
Paul Corbit Brown, from the US organisation Keepers of the Mountains and present at the Crédit Agricole AGM today to ask the bank to decisively end its support for the barbaric mountaintop removal (MTR) coal mining technique used in the Appalachian mountains, said:
""Crédit Agricole is going even further than Bank of America with its recent announcement that it will reduce but not end its investments in coal mining. Notable too is that Crédit Agricole's commitment covers much of its financial support, including finance for projects, for companies and underwriting services.""
Crédit Agricole had previously announced in 2013 an end to its MTR financing, yet it had remained involved in the financing of the most active MTR companies via its underwriting services. 
While campaigners welcomed Crédit Agricole's announcement today, they also pointed out its limitations. One principal drawback is that the new Crédit Agricole policy applies only to companies that are focused specifically on coal extraction. Therefore the bank can continue to finance coal extraction via support for multi-nationals such as BHP Billiton, Glencore or Anglo American. A further caveat is that Crédit Agricole has announced nothing concerning its financing of coal power plant projects and producers of electricity derived from coal, a sector that the bank supported with more than 4.7 billion euros between 2005 and April 2014. 
Thomas Mnguni, a South African who attended today's AGM to inform Crédit Agricole that coal is an obsolete energy form both in the north and the south, commented:
""You can't talk about 'small support' or projects with 'minor impacts' when you talk about coal. Whether it's extraction or combustion in power plants, coal destroys the climate and the livelihoods of entire communities. In 2009, Crédit Agricole participated in the financing of the massive Medupi and Kusile coal plant projects in South Africa which have only reinforced inequality in the country. Today I asked Crédit Agricole to refrain from making the same mistake and to commit to not provide finance for new coal plants, in particular for the Thabametsi plant being developed by Engie in South Africa. Instead, as South Africa has one of the best potentials for renewable energy in the world, the bank should be supporting this sector's development.""
Yann Louvel, BankTrack's Climate and Energy coordinator, said:
""After ten years of campaigning from Friends of the Earth France and BankTrack, we welcome this breakthrough from Crédit Agricole. We now call on the bank to go further by signing the Paris Pledge  and ending its support for the coal sector completely. This should start with Crédit Agricole pulling out of the Plomin C coal plant project in Croatia and extend to no future financing of any coal plant. The bank now has seven months to quit coal.""

BASEL, SWITZERLAND / PULAU PADANG, RIAU, INDONESIA ",Roger Federer encourages rainforest campaigners,Credit Suisse ,Switzerland,APRIL ,forestry - pulp and paper,Indonesia,"
Tennis
 star Roger Federer is calling on Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank, to 
review their business relationship with RGE/APRIL, an Indonesian pulp 
and paper group that is responsible for the wide-spread clearcutting of 
rainforests in the Indonesian province of Riau (Sumatra). Federer was 
approached last month by Isnadi Esman and Woro Supartinah, two 
Indonesian activists who had travelled to Switzerland to protest against
 a 50 million Euro loan granted by Credit Suisse to RGE/APRIL.
""I
 have learnt about your letter to me, outlining the difficult rainforest
 situation in Riau"", Federer writes to the Indonesian campaigners. ""I 
take your concerns seriously. In response to your letter and as 
ambassador for Credit Suisse, I would like to emphasize that I will 
advocate for and have complete trust that they analyse such issues 
thoroughly, evaluate all options and that their decisions are well 
thought out.""
The
 tennis star continues: ""Additionally, I encourage you to continue the 
ongoing dialogue with Credit Suisse in order to minimize any 
sustainability issues and increase the common understanding.""
On
 24 April 2015, Isnadi and Woro informed Credit Suisse's top management 
on RGE/APRIL's conduct in Riau at the bank's annual general meeting in 
Zurich. The bank's Chief Risk Officer, Joachim Oechslin, promised to 
personally vet every potential future transaction with the Indonesian 
group.
RGE/APRIL
 has been accused of illegal logging, peatland clearing and numerous 
human rights violations in their operations in Riau. Credit Suisse, 
together with a number of Chinese banks, are the Indonesian group's main
 financial backers. "

Paris ",BNP Paribas AGM: time to quit coal!,BNP Paribas ,France,Rampal coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Bangladesh,"
In less than seven months' time, Paris will host the twenty-first United Nations conference on climate change. The banks, as major economic players, are expected at the meeting. By December this year, they will be judged on what they have done - or not done - to prevent global warming and its consequences for the people of this planet. Thus, as the BNP Paribas annual general meeting takes place today in Paris, Friends of the Earth France, BankTrack and a variety of political, scientific and civil society figures are calling on the bank to sign the Paris Pledge and bring an end to its huge support for the coal industry, the biggest emitter of CO2. 


BNP Paribas alone accounts for half of the total support - now totalling more than 30 billion euros - provided by French banks to the coal industry between 2005 and April 2014.  Top French coal bank, BNP Paribas is also ranked among the top ten international banks in terms of support for the coal industry. Moreover, according to a briefing published today by Friends of the Earth France and BankTrack, BNP Paribas' adoption in 2011 of a sectoral policy aimed at controlling the impacts of the bank's activities in the coal power sector has not been able to prevent the rising trend in coal finance seen at BNP Paribas in 2012 and 2013. 

Lucie Pinson, Private finance campaigner for Friends of the Earth France, commented:


""It's time for BNP to change track and become part of the solution rather than the problem. A few weeks ago BNP Paribas opted not to participate in the mining projects located in Australia's Galilee Basin. This was a good move, but no matter where you are in the world, and with the price of renewable energy constantly falling, it's no longer possible to accept the environmental and social impacts of coal. That's why we're calling on the bank to sign the Paris Pledge and to commit before the Paris COP to end its support for the coal industry, for the benefit of the climate and public health. This call is backed today by numerous political, scientific and civil society figures in an advert published today in Le Monde."" 
In the company of Maha Mirza, an activist from Bangladesh, the groups are also calling on BNP Paribas during its AGM to immediately commit to not financing the Rampal coal-fired power plant project.

Yann Louvel, Climate and Energy coordinator for BankTrack, said:


""The billions of euros of support extended to the coal industry every year by BNP Paribas end up in projects that will pump out millions of tons of CO2 every year for decades, destroying pristine environments and threatening the survival of local populations. The Rampal project in Bangladesh, still only in the development stage, is one such case. It threatens the UNESCO-protected Sunderbans, the world's largest mangrove forest, as well as local communities, yet the project promoters are approaching even the big international banks for financing.


""Today we're also publishing the summary of a new study that shows the Rampal project contravenes the Equator Principles, a voluntary agreement signed up to by 80 global financial institutions.  It's why we're calling on BNP Paribas, which has provided funding in the past to NTPC, one of the project promoters, to take the lead and commit publicly to not financing Rampal, as it did recently with the Galilee Basin projects.""
Along with representatives from other communities directly affected by coal in South Africa and the US, Friends of the Earth France will also be appealing to Crédit Agricole, Société Générale and BPCE at their forthcoming AGMs as well as on the 'Climate Finance Day' to not miss the opportunity to prove their commitment to fighting climate change.


In the view of Friends of the Earth France and BankTrack, such commitments need to be measured concretely by the banks signing the Paris Pledge and an end to their coal support. To ensure that the banks really do turn the page on coal and enter fully into the twenty-first century, Friends of the Earth France is appealing to the banks' clients to call on the institutions to take the necessary steps before the Paris climate summit in November.

Singapore ","WWF: ASEAN regional banks and investors behind on Environmental, Social and Governance standards",,,,,,"
A WWF report finds an alarming gap between 
regional ASEAN financial institutions and the environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) standards adopted by their international counterparts. 
 Moreover, WWF reports a similar shortfall exists between regional 
financial regulations on responsible lending guidelines and corporate 
sustainability disclosure requirements as compared to their counterparts
 in Brazil, China, South Africa and Hong Kong.   The report, released today at the Singapore Institute of International Affairs's 2nd Singapore Dialogue on Sustainable World Resources, assesses to what 
degree regional capital providers are factoring sustainability issues 
into their lending and investment activities. It argues strongly for 
regional financiers to act in their own long-term interests and adopt 
ESG practices with urgency. It also calls for sustainable banking 
guidelines and more prescriptive sustainability disclosure requirements 
to be issued by regulatory authorities across ASEAN.   ""There is mounting evidence across Asia that environmental and social 
issues present growing risks to economic growth and social stability"", 
explains report co-author Jeanne Stampe, WWF Asia Finance and 
Commodities Specialist. ""Global banks and international institutional 
investors have begun to address these issues in their lending and 
investment decision-making processes. Global regulators have also 
provided supporting regulatory frameworks. It´s now time for financial 
institutions in SE Asia and their regulators to play their part.""   The risks presented by commercial logging and plantations for palm oil 
and pulp are adopted as a central case in the report supporting the call
 to action. The industries contribute significantly  to regional 
economic growth but are also linked to the destruction of globally 
important tropical forests and the annual haze blighting the region.     Sustainable finance in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia: a Review 
of Financiers' ESG Practices, Disclosure Standards and Regulations draws from information made public by key financial institutions. These 
include banks such as DBS, CIMB and Bank Negara Indonesia, and investors
 such as Temasek, EPF and PNB.   The report highlights that banks can use ESG to strengthen credit risk 
management, reduce reputational risks, deepen client relationships and 
create new financial products. For investors, ESG can underpin 
investment returns as sound ESG management at the portfolio company 
level is linked to better operational practices and share price 
performance. Moreover, the performance of all financiers is linked to 
the economy, giving them a vested interest to address systemic risks 
such as climate change which can impact entire portfolios. Deforestation
 and forest degradation are important contributors to climate change, 
which should put these issues high on the agenda of financiers.   ""For the health of the economy, society and the environment, policy 
makers should integrate sustainable development issues into capital and 
lending market policymaking,"" noted Steve Waygood, Chief Responsible 
Investment Officer, Aviva Investors. ""But there are plenty of steps 
banks and investors can take now even without regulation, to ensure 
their investment and lending portfolios have taken into account 
sustainability risks and opportunities and are resilient in the face of 
impending crises and regulatory changes""   ASEAN Banks Lagging   The report finds regional ASEAN banks and investors are lagging on ESG 
issues. For example, only four out of the 18 banks analysed disclosed 
the use of ESG as a tool in their credit processes and only one of these
 four had a forest sector policy. Of the 12 domestic investors, only two
 disclosed their corporate governance policy, and only one of these 
policies refers directly to ESG expectations for portfolio companies.    Low levels of ESG integration at domestic banks show the need for 
regulators to issue ""green"" credit or sustainable banking guidelines 
and/or require mandatory environmental and social impact assessments 
(ESIA) prior to loan disbursements, as is being done in China and 
Brazil. Low levels of ESG practices by domestic investors also suggests a
 role for regulators to support stewardship codes promoting responsible 
investment practices.    Of importance, the report finds that while there is a clear case for 
sustainable production, only a minority of companies disclose their 
policies and practices. For example, amongst timber and pulp and paper 
companies, only 26% of companies disclose the legality of their base 
supply; although this is required by major EU and US markets. Similarly,
 only 19% of palm oil companies disclose time-bound targets to reduce 
GHG emissions, a glaring omission by an industry central to efforts to 
combat climate change due to deforestation and planting on peat, and 
that is vulnerable to weather changes and faces regulatory risk. The 
poor disclosure is partly linked to the fact that in these 3 countries, 
stock exchange disclosure requirements on ESG issues are too general. As
 such, the report calls on regulators to require the disclosure of 
statistical information, as is done in Hong Kong and provide detailed 
sector guidelines.   As part of its Market Transformation Initiative, WWF is working with 
major soft commodity supply chain and financial actors to show that 
commodities can be produced at affordable costs with measurably reduced 
environmental and social impacts. In the light of this report, WWF calls
 upon regional banks, investors, and companies to adopt ESG practices 
using a structured framework, to be transparent and report on their 
progress, and to join multi-stakeholder initiatives such as (voluntary) 
certification schemes or industry collaborative platforms to access best
 management practice and support from peers. Finally, WWF urges 
regulators to provide national guidelines on ESG integration for banks 
and mandatory reporting standards for listed companies "

Amsterdam ",ING announces end to financing of major mountaintop removal coal miners,ING ,Netherlands,Mountain top removal coal mining ,mining - coal ,United States,"
At its annual general meeting today, Dutch bank ING revealed that as part of its updated environmental and risk framework, it is to end financing for coal mining companies that produce more than one million tons of coal extracted using the highly controversial practice of mountaintop removal (MTR).
Yann Louvel, BankTrack's Climate and Energy Campaign Coordinator, commented: ""Following similar recent moves from other European banks Barclays, BNP Paribas, RBS and Société Générale, this is another important step forward since it will exclude US coal mining companies such as Arch Coal and Alpha Natural Resources, the main MTR producers, and it covers ING underwriting, not only lending. ING must now go further and exclude all MTR producers from its portfolio.""
Paul Corbit Brown, from the Appalachian organisation Keepers of the Mountains in the United States, participated earlier today at the ING AGM. 
Paul Corbit Brown commented: ""ING has been involved in the past few years in several transactions with MTR producers like Arch Coal, Metinvest and ArcelorMittal. By supporting these companies, it participated in the destruction of one of the most beautiful mountain ranges in the world. The coal industry uses more than 3,000 tons of explosives daily to blow up our mountains, burying thousands of miles of rivers and causing rains to spread poisons in our communities. MTR is not just an environmental crime but is a real danger to people, and we are seeing cancer cases multiply. 
""That's why I asked the ING board today the precise content of their new policy on MTR and if it would exclude such transactions in the future. ING's new MTR direction will be further encouragement for affected communities that are fighting back against the industry.""
ING had mentioned in its recently published annual report for 2014 that ""New restrictions on financing the controversial mountaintop removal mining practice in the US Appalachia have been introduced"", but the content of the new policy was not made public until today.
Ralph Hamers, ING's chief executive officer, answered Paul Corbit Brown stating that ING will no longer finance the main MTR producers - companies producing more than one million tons of coal via MTR every year.
Paul Corbit Brown continued: ""While this is a good step, damage from MTR operations does not start at one million tons but with the first one. There are no more than 20 companies practicing MTR. ING should exclude all of these 20 companies altogether.""

Yann Louvel concluded: ""Following today's welcome news, we will closely track the implementation of this new policy at ING and along with our international partners continue to exert pressure on laggard banks that continue to bankroll this dodgy practice. It is now time for Credit Agricole, Natixis and Deutsche Bank, among others, to follow suit and end any financial link with MTR producers.""

Nijmegen ",NGOs call for Green Bond Principles to better address transparency,,,,,,"
A
coalition of seventeen NGOs has sent an open letter to the signatories of the
Green Bond Principles, calling for more information on green bonds to be made
public.
The
letter calls on the Principles to:

 explicitly
require that information on second party reviews or other assurance, use of
proceeds and annual reporting be placed in the public domain; and
 take
steps to make clear that projects which come at the expense of human rights
violations and significant negative social and environmental impacts should not
be considered ""green"".

""We are
increasingly concerned about the significant gap between the stated aims of the
Green Bond Principles to increase transparency and disclosure, and their actual
contents, which explicitly allow and provide for important information on green
bonds to remain under wraps,"" said the letter.
""Combined
with the decision of the Principles to avoid addressing the issue of ""what is
green"" head-on, this lack of transparency means that Observers, civil society
organisations and others do not have the information available to adequately
scrutinise the market's development.""

Charlotte, North Carolina, United States ",Bank of America dumps coal mining in sweeping new policy,Bank of America ,United States,,,,"
Bank of America unveiled a new global coal mining policy yesterday committing to reduce exposure to coal mining companies across the board. Bank of America's Andrew Plepler announced the new policy at the bank's annual shareholder meeting this morning in Charlotte, stating, ""With regard to coal, over the past several years we have been gradually and consistently reducing our credit exposure to companies focused on coal mining. Our new policy...reflects our decision to continue to reduce our credit exposure over time to the coal mining sector globally."" The policy change comes after four years of campaigning from Rainforest Action Network and other groups, and is the strongest policy of its kind to date.
- To read the full Bank of America policy: http://bit.ly/1EXv0Ge- 2015 Coal Finance Report Card, with grades for Bank of America: http://bit.ly/1cdZYzb- Timeline of RAN's campaign to push BofA, with photos and video: http://bit.ly/1FPrYEK
""Today's announcement from Bank of America truly represents a sea change: it acknowledges the responsibility that the financial sector bears for supporting and profiting from the fossil fuel industry and the climate chaos it has caused,"" said Rainforest Action Network Climate and Energy Program Director Amanda Starbuck. ""In real terms, this means the bank is turning its back on the coal mining industry and committing to energy efficiency and renewable energy.""
In light of the new coal policy, Bank of America received a BBB grade on coal mining from Rainforest Action Network, BankTrack, and the Sierra Club in the 2015 Coal Finance Report Card - the highest grade given to a bank to date in the report card. The 2015 report card, which was released Monday, cited the impending Bank of America policy change as a bright spot that other banks should emulate. The new Bank of America commitment states, ""Bank of America will continue to reduce our credit exposure to coal extraction companies. This commitment applies globally, to companies focused on coal extraction and to divisions of diversified a mining companies that are focused on coal.""
""This is a challenge to other financial institutions,"" said Starbuck. ""We don't need banks to change the lightbulbs at their corporate headquarters, we need them to stop bankrolling fossil fuels that are killing the climate.""
However, Bank of America received lower grades in coal-fired power and human rights, and Starbuck cautioned that Bank of America will have to live up to its commitments on coal-mining. ""RAN will rigorously monitor the implementation of this policy and hold Bank of America to its word. We also hope other banks will go further than Bank of America went today. There are just a few short years left to prevent catastrophic damage from runaway climate change. We need to cut off the financial support for the coal industry - and we need to keep all fossil fuels in the ground.""
RAN announced its campaign targeting Bank of America in 2011, in light of the fact that Bank of America was considered the most resistant to changing its position on coal of all the major American investment banks. RAN, along with hundreds of allied groups, previously introduced shareholder resolutions at Bank of America annual meetings; worked with directly-impacted communities in the Powder River Basin, Appalachia, India, and Colombia to document environmental and human rights abuses related to Bank of America-backed coal mining companies; disrupted Bank of America recruitment efforts on campuses; organized direct action protests at Bank of America branch locations; and hung a ""Bank of Coal"" banner off the side of Bank of America stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina, among many other tactics.

Hong Kong ",Greenpeace activists protest Standard Chartered’s role in reef wrecking coal mine,Standard Chartered ,United Kingdom,Carmichael coal mine project ,mining - coal  | transport and infrastructure,Australia,"
Twenty Greenpeace Hong Kong activists took action at Standard Chartered's Hong Kong headquarters today, just hours before the company's annual general meeting in London, urging the bank to end its association with one of the world's largest coal mines threatening the World Heritage Great Barrier Reef. Activists displayed a stair banner using a dead fish in a new spin on the bank's logo in front of the building. ""Scientists have long warned that coal expansion is not compatible with a healthy reef and climate change is the greatest long-term threat to one of the world's great natural wonders. Standard Chartered must live up to its own sustainability policies and follow other global banks that are distancing themselves from this destructive mega coal mine,"" said Greenpeace's Senior Business Advisor Elsa Lee. ""Besides the obvious environmental problems arising from the Carmichael mine, the financial advisory role that Standard Chartered is playing for the project carries massive economic and reputational risks for the bank and its shareholders. This issue ought to be on top of Mr Bill Winters agenda as he gets ready to take the top job at Standard Chartered later this month."" Standard Chartered is currently advising the coal miner Adani, which plans to develop the Carmichael mine in Australia and expand the Abbot Point coal port in north-east Australia by dredging up millions of tonnes of seafloor in the World Heritage Area. The expanded port would also send hundreds of extra coal ships through the Reef, increasing the risk of accidents and oil spills. The World Heritage site is already under enormous threat from climate change and any additional coal industry project along the Great Barrier Reef will significantly contribute to its decline and negatively impact on the health of its precious underwater ecosystem. ""There is growing concern about the future of coal and smart money is pulling out of the sector to avoid their capital from becoming stranded. Only short-sighted banks and investors would continue to turn a blind eye to the risks of continued fossil fuel extraction,"" said Elsa Lee. Indeed, 11 international banks, including Standard Chartered's competitor HSBC and Morgan Stanley have publicly stated that they will not finance the Carmichael coal mine if they were asked to. The annual general meeting of Standard Chartered will take place in London later today, where shareholders of the bank will meet with top management to discuss the bank's performance.

Nijmegen, San Francisco ",Bankrolling climate chaos: banks kept coal on life support in 2014,,,,,,"
Download the full report, with 2014 bank grades. 


At a time when declarations about ""the end of coal"" abound, leading financial institutions have continued to put billions of dollars into coal mining and coal-fired power, despite dire warnings from climate scientists that we must end coal use immediately to avert catastrophic levels of global warming.
Global banks collectively financed $141 billion for coal mining and coal power companies in 2014, according to the annual coal finance report card released today by BankTrack, Rainforest Action Network and the Sierra Club. The findings in the 2015 report card indicate that, despite a dismal long-term financial outlook for the coal industry, banks have thus far been willing to prolong the demise of coal in the service of short-term profits - and at the expense of the global climate.
This year's report card, entitled ""The End of Coal?"", does identify some bright spots in coal finance, with a critical mass of banks saying ""no"" to particularly destructive coal mining projects and practices, including proposed development of the Galilee Basin in Australia, and mountaintop removal mining in the United States. In addition, in 2014 key financial industry voices concluded that the shift away from fossil fuels has reached a turning point, with Goldman Sachs concluding that coal for power production has ""reached its retirement age"" and Bloomberg New Energy Finance marking the ""beginning of the end"" for fossil fuels.
But despite these pronouncements, the end of coal will not come soon enough to limit climate change to internationally-agreed upon safe levels, unless banks act to drastically and rapidly end financing for coal.
Ben Collins, Senior Climate and Energy Campaigner at Rainforest Action Network, said: ""Many leading banks have acknowledged that financial institutions have a responsibility to usher in the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Unfortunately, the same institutions that frequently tout their clean energy investments and LEED-certified headquarters are also keeping the coal industry on life support at time when climate scientists tell us we need to leave almost all coal in the ground, starting immediately, if we want to keep climate change to levels compatible with ongoing human civilisation.
""We saw some signs of progress in 2014 with banks steering clear of some particularly egregious mining projects and practices, like Australia's Galilee Basin and mountaintop removal mining in the U.S. Appalachian region. But unfortunately it's not enough. We need banks to respond with leadership to the existential threat posed by climate change. Coal will die one way or another, but if banks wait to ditch coal until the market forces them to, the death of coal will come too late for the climate.""
Yann Louvel, BankTrack's Climate and Energy Campaign Coordinator, said: ""Looking at the slow evolution of bank policies related to the environmental and climate impacts of their coal financing, this year's report card is showing some positive signs of individual steps forward here and steps forward there.
""However, with time fast running out for proactive climate action to have any meaningful effect, the banks are basically fiddling with their policies while more and more coal burns as a result of entrenched levels of coal financing. It's outrageous for some banks to be hitching themselves to this year's UN climate negotiations in Paris as 'climate leaders' while they are not prepared to pull out of all coal sector financing, end of story.
""The banks' attention to the human rights considerations that are always involved in coal sector financing are patchy at best, and amount to little more than lip service to the UN human rights obligations that so many of them are signed up to. For as long as these banks continue to be coal industry supporters, they have to substantially beef up their human rights due diligence to protect communities in the industry's firing line around the world.""
Bruce Nilles, Senior Campaign Director, Beyond Coal at the Sierra Club said: ""While there is demonstrated progress on the part of financial institutions, it's too little and too slow moving if we're to see any real impact on the climate disruption or public health. Banks need to better own their role and more actively harness their influence to transition off dirty energy sources.""
Key findings from the 2015 report card:
• In spite of the financial distress faced by the coal industry overall, banks have approached financing decisions in a piecemeal fashion, with global financing for coal mining and top coal-fired power companies holding steady at $141 billion, compared to $145 billion in 2013.
• Disappointingly, major banks have also continued to finance several worst-of-the-worst ""extreme coal"" producers with major human and environmental impacts. Continued exposure to these coal mining companies shows that several banks continue to fail to meet basic human rights and environmental responsibilities.
• Global bank financing for coal mining, 2014: $66.37 billion (up from $55.28 billion in 2013)
• Global bank financing for the 30 largest coal-fired power producers, 2014: $74.39 billion, (down from $89.62 billion in 2013)

Zurich ",Sumatran activists to challenge Credit Suisse over finance for deforestation,Credit Suisse ,Switzerland,APRIL ,forestry - pulp and paper,Indonesia,"
Two activists from Sumatra, Indonesia will attend the AGM of Credit Suisse today to challenge the bank on its financing of forest destruction in their communities. Woro Supartinah and Isnadi Esman will tell the delegates about the impacts the bank's client, the RGE Group, and its subsidiary Asia Pacific Resources International Limited (APRIL), are causing to their communities.

 

APRIL is the second largest pulp and paper company in Indonesia. Civil society groups have documented the company's extensive track record of involvement in illegal deforestation, social conflict and corruption scandals .

 

Credit Suisse provided RGE Group with a US$50 million loan as part of a syndicate in 2013. A BankTrack analysis has found that this finance breached Credit Suisse's Forestry and Agribusiness Policy, including on all six counts of its ""excluded activities"". Two other major financiers of the company, the Spanish bank Santander and the Dutch bank ABN Amro, have declared that they will not provide any further finance to the company until it improves its record on deforestation.

 

Woro Supartinah, from the NGO Jikalahari in Indonesia's Riau province, said: ""We have travelled here from Indonesia because we want to tell Credit Suisse about what its client APRIL is doing in Sumatra. They have already cleared 5 million hectares of forest and most of this is located on deep peat areas, which are protected. The dried and cleared peat is like a tinderbox and catches fire very easily. Last year the peat fires were so intense that the haze affected more than 50,000 people. Planes could no longer take off and we got scared, because we are trapped on this place.""

 

Isnadi Esman, an activist from the island of Pulau Padang on the coast of Sumatra, said: ""We were living peacefully in Pulau Padang, until APRIL arrived in 2009 and started to destroy our homes. Our villages, which once were standing in the middle of the lush forest, are now surrounded by monoculture plantations. The things we eat or use from the forest don't grow in plantations. The animals are on the run because they also are losing their homes. More and more they are coming across villagers in their path, and attacks are increasing.""

 

The company's operations have caused numerous protests by communities against the clearing of forests on the island. In 2011, a group of 28 people sewed their mouth shut in protest against APRIL, in despair at their voices not being heard.

 

Yesterday Woro and Isnadi, together with representatives of Greenpeace, the Environmental Paper Network, the Bruno Manser Fund and Banktrack, met with representatives from Credit Suisse to discuss the bank's involvement with the company . Greenpeace presented the company with a petition signed by nearly 25,000 supporters calling on Credit Suisse not to provide further finance while the deforestation is ongoing. Woro and Isnadi have also written to Roger Federer, a brand ambassador for Credit Suisse, calling on the Swiss tennis champion to use his influence to help their cause .

 

Banktrack is urging Credit Suisse to follow the lead of Santander and ABN AMRO and commit not to provide RGE Group or APRIL with new loans until the company has made significant improvements in its policy and its practices.

 
UPDATE: Credit Suisse gave assurances at the AGM that no future transactions would be conducted with APRIL in the future without the personal involvement and

explicit approval of the Chief Risk Officer. See the AGM Minutes.

Zurich ",Tennis Star Roger Federer urged to help stop Credit Suisse from funding deforestation in Indonesia,Credit Suisse ,Switzerland,APRIL ,forestry - pulp and paper,Indonesia,"
Indonesian
rainforest community representatives have sent an urgent appeal to Tennis star
Roger Federer, asking him for help to stop the pulp and paper group, RGE /
APRIL, from destroying their livelihoods in the Indonesian province of Riau,
Sumatra.
The Indonesians undertook the unusual step after earlier attempts to
convince Swiss banking group Credit Suisse to stop funding RGE/APRIL's highly
detrimental logging activities had failed. Roger Federer is a brand ambassador
for Credit Suisse which, together with Chinese banks, has a major role in
funding RGE/APRIL.
„We are writing to you to ask for your urgent assistance to help us
save our community lands and to stop illegal logging and deforestation in our
unique tropical peatland forests"", Isnadi Esman and Woro Supartinah wrote to
Federer last week.
Mister Federer hasn't replied to their letter yet.
Isnadi and Woro are currently in Zurich to meet Credit Suisse
officials and speak at the bank's annual general meeting on Friday. In 2013, Credit
Suisse lent RGE/APRIL USD 50 million for pulp and paper operations in
breach of the bank's own sustainability standards.
Santander and ABN/AMRO distanced themselves from RGE / APRIL earlier
this year after a KPMG audit of RGE/APRIL's operations in Riau.

Nijmegen ",BankTrack's 2014 Annual Report highlights successes from coal and forest campaigns,,,,,,"
BankTrack today launched its 2014 Annual Report, presenting its campaigning work over 2014 in a brief and accessible 20-page summary.
The new annual report covers BankTrack's three major campaigns of 2014, on forests, human rights and finance for the coal industry, as well as showcasing victories and successes, Dodgy Deal campaigns and the work of BankTrack's members and partners.Highlights of 2014 covered in the report include:

Banks withdrawing from environmentally damaging projects, companies and sectors after civil society pressure, including Australian coal projects Abbot Point and Alpha Coal, the Indonesian palm oil producer Bumitama, and the devastating practice ofmountaintop removal for coal extraction;
The launch of BankTrack's coalbanks.org websiteas part of the ""Banks: Quit Coal!"" campaign, presenting the 20 biggest bankers of coal mining and coal power, as well as the largest ever dataset on the financial links between banks and the coal industry;
The ""Banking with Principles?"" report, which benchmarked the progress of 32 large global banks against the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, showing that three and a half years after the Principles' adoption, major gaps remain in banks' policies, reporting and provision of channels for remedy;
Teaming up with the Environmental Paper Network for a new campaign on bank finance for the pulp and paper sector, which showed significant progress in early 2015 when both Santander and ABN Amro committed to withdraw from financing APRIL, the Indonesian paper company named by Greenpeace as ""Indonesia's biggest forest destroyer"".

The report also details the transformation of BankTrack in 2015 from a network of civil society organisations to an independent campaigning body, a change described by BankTrack director Johan Frijns as ""the most substantial transformation in BankTrack's 13 year history"".
BankTrack's Director Johan Frijns commented: ""The new BankTrack will be a tracking, campaigning and support organisation, able to work more fluidly to support civil society organisations, but also able to pursue our own campaigns determinedly, as we have done in the past,"" Michelle Chan of Friends of the Earth US, BankTrack Chair, commented: ""Across each of these three fronts - coal, forests and human rights -we are succeeding in making it harder for banks to get away with financing environmentally and socially destructive projects, and in raising the pressure for higher lending standards. None of these wins is BankTrack's alone, but part of a wider global movement for change. As we look to transform our organisational structure in 2015, we expect to play an even more valuable role in this movement.""
The transformation of BankTrack from a network into an independent organisation will see gradual changes over the coming months, culminating in the launch of a brand new website during the summer.

Madrid ",Investing in unsustainable EU fishing is risky business,,,,,,"
Recent changes to EU fishing and seafood legislation means that the financing of fishing operations reliant on overexploited stocks, or the use of destructive or unselective methods will prove a high risk to investors, Greenpeace warned today.The newly published Greenpeace briefing ""Risky Business - Why Smart Investors Must Avoid Unsustainable Seafood Operations"" outlines how a culture of overfishing, combined with sweeping changes in the European Union's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), the Common Market Regulation and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) may radically affect both the profitability of fishing companies, and the seafood market in general.""Thanks to the reformed EU Common Fisheries Policy regime, which encourages Europe's fishing community to shift towards environmentally sustainable methods and to embrace practices that bring positive social impacts, opportunities are narrowing for Europe's industrial fishing operators, for example Sapmer, Inpesca S.A and Albacora S.A., who have spent decades profiting from destructive fishing practices, weak fisheries policies, large subsidies and financial investment"", said Greenpeace Common Fisheries Policy Coordinator Nina Thuellen.""Smart investors should take note of these changes, and start moving their money towards brighter financial prospects, and a better future for oceans and fish stocks"", continued Thuellen.The new CFP requires that fishing opportunities be reduced for overfished stocks, and a 'no-discards' policy will be observed, making unselective fishing operations more costly. In addition, fishing capacity will need to be reduced and higher sustainability standards will also be applied to EU fishing vessels operating outside EU waters.Alternative opportunities are highlighted in the briefing, such as investment in selective, low-impact fishing operations - like hand line and pole and line fisheries, which should benefit from greater access to fishing opportunities under the new CFP. The new rules foresee that access to fishing opportunities will be reorganised, moving to a system that is performance-based and incentivises low-impact fishing.""With this new regulatory reality for Europe's fishing industry in place, the finance and banking sector have a real chance to become agents of positive change within the fishing industry. The most clued-in investors will see the common sense in transferring their funding towards low-impact, sustainable fisheries businesses that ensure healthy oceans and healthy fisheries"", concluded Thuellen.Download Risky Business - Why Smart Investors Must Avoid Unsustainable Seafood OperationsNotes for Editors:Since 2009, Sapmer owner of the monster boat Franche Terre (flagged as Mayotte) has invested in the construction of at least eight new tuna purse seiners for operation in the Indian Ocean. In 2012, French public financier L'Agence Francaise de Développement (AFD) lent Sapmer €13 million for the construction of the tuna purse seiner Belouve .In 2010, BRED and Banque de la Réunion -- Groupe BPCE loaned €75 million to Sapmer for construction of three tuna purse seiners. The UK's Barclays Bank has loaned a minimum of €4.25 million to Sapmer's subsidiaries for their operations in Mauritius. However the company appears to be in financial difficulties, reporting a loss of €11.9 million in 2014 . A reshuffle of Sapmer's top management took place in December 2014 and operations were shifted to Seychelles for cost-cutting purposes. Due to its poor financial performance, Sapmer has delayed plans for construction of ten new tuna vessels for the Pacific region .In December 2011, Spain's BBVA (Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria) provided a short-term loan of €6.4 million to Inpesca S.A., owner of monster boat Txori Argi. In 2012, the vessel was caught fishing without a licence in the EEZ of Mozambique and fined €1.2 million. The Txori Argi was released from custody after the Spanish bank BBVA guaranteed payment of the fine to the Mozambique Ministry of Fisheries. However, when Mozambique's government attempted to cash the guarantee, it was unable, and asked the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) to put Txori Argi on its Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing vessel list. The case was settled for $700,000 (€523,581) in 2013. Inpesca owns the Txori Argi, the Txori Udin and the Txori Berri; all vessels were suspected of being involved in fishing with false licences in Liberian waters .Kutxabank, BBVA, Banco Santander, Caixa Galicia (now merged with other banks and named Abanca) and La Caixa together provided around €15.7 million of bank loans to Albacora S.A. as of December 2012. Albacora S.A. is the owner of monster boats Albacora Uno and Albatun Tres; both vessels have a long history of convicted illegal fishing activities of tuna in the Western Central Pacific, including in the Kiribati EEZ .In 2010, the Albacora Uno was caught fishing illegally on 67 Fish Aggregation Devices (FADs) over a period of two years in the US Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Albacora S.A., the company that owns the vessel and the USA's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) agreed on a settlement of US$5 million .Albacora Uno was one of three vessels caught by the Marshall Islands Marine Resources Authority (MIMRA) in July 2012 with shark skins, fins and carcasses on board . It was fined US$55,000 by MIMRA. Eighteen shark carcasses were confiscated.

Nijmegen ",Briefing to banks and potential investors on the ongoing risks and outstanding social conflicts in the palm oil agribusiness sector: Golden Agri-Resources (GAR) bond offering,BNY Mellon ,United States,Golden Agri-Resources (GAR) ,agriculture - palm oil ,Singapore,"
Credit
Suisse, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC) and Mitsubishi UFJ
Securities are acting for Golden Agri-Resources - part of the Sinar Mas Group -
in a new bond offering worth up to USD 400 million, according to a Debtwire
report last week. The syndicate has begun meetings with credit investors this week in Hong Kong
and Singapore.
Banks and
investors must examine the full range of environmental, social, reputational, legal
and market risks prevalent in the palm oil sector and ensure that they
undertake enhanced, robust due diligence procedures to identify, understand and
screen these risks prior to any financing.
Effective bank
policies and due diligence systems would ensure banks and investors avoid
providing any financial support to companies that lack adequate palm oil
policies or are involved in tropical deforestation, plantation expansion on
carbon-rich tropical peatlands, failure to respect and uphold the rights of
Indigenous peoples and communities to provide their free, prior and informed
consent to activities impacting their customary lands, or on-going violations
of human and labor rights.
A strong
palm oil commitment is an important first step towards being a responsible
company, but banks and investors should not assume that companies with strong
palm oil commitments in place are free of environmental, social, reputational,
legal and market risks.
GAR's 2011
Forest Conservation Policy and recent sustainability efforts indicate GAR's
commitment to become a more responsible business. However, there remain some major
issues in GAR's policy implementation at this time. Banks and investors must ensure that GAR actively addresses
these problems prior to providing financial services or investment.
The
following grievances between GAR and communities in Indonesia and Liberia must
be resolved to the satisfaction of the communities impacted as a matter of
priority:

This month the Round
     table on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) found GAR to be in violation of its certification
     standards and procedures. This was the result of detailed field studies of
     GAR operations in West Kalimantan by the Forest Peoples Programme, TUK and
     LinkAR-Borneo. The complaint found that GAR failed to obtain the Free Prior and Informed
     Consent (FPIC) of local communities, failed to undertake proper
     assessments of High Conservation Value areas (HCV), and was in
     non-compliance with Indonesian laws in relation to plantation permits. 


A recent study by the Forest Peoples Programme
     into GAR's palm oil operations with Golden Veroleum Liberia Inc. (GVL)
     shows major environmental and social concerns also exist in the group's
     Liberia operations. The report cites numerous failures to adhere to key provisions in
     applicable law, RSPO standards and GAR's own Forest Conservation Policy.
     The report states that the group's social engagement is seriously flawed
     in both policy and practice, leading to vague, inadequate and potentially
     unenforceable promises of development benefits, while risking the
     permanent loss of, and damage to, community lands, natural resources,
     livelihoods and cultures. In particular, the report finds that the group's
     business model being applied in Liberia is incompatible with the key
     legal, RSPO and Forest Conservation Policy tenet of free, prior and
     informed consent (FPIC), causing significant community division and
     conflict in the process. The study concluded that land has been and
     continues to be taken by the company without community's FPIC.


In November 2014,
     GAR confirmed that it was sourcing from companies operating within the Leuser Ecosystem, a
     global hotspot for biodiversity on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia. This
     area is the last place on Earth where critically endangered Sumatran
     orangutans, elephants, tigers, and rhinos are found together in the wild.
     Investigations by Rainforest Action Network have shown that GAR is at risk
     of sourcing from growers that have cleared and continue to clear High
     Conservation Value areas, High Carbon Stock forests and peatlands within
     the Leuser Ecosystem. GAR has not yet fully implemented its sustainability policies in order to exclude
     supplies of conflict palm oil from its supply chain.

GAR's parent company - the Sinar Mas
Group - has come under scrutiny following the brutal murder of Indra Pelani - a
local Indonesian farmer and land rights activist killed by security guards
contracted by Sinar Mas's Asia Pulp and Paper. The company immediately
condemned the killing and sacked the security personnel, but the incident
points to the severity of risk associated with long-term conflict between
Indonesia's plantation sector and local communities.
Banks
and potential investors committed to implementing responsible
investment standards should require GAR to commit to:

Halt operations in any areas of disputed land
     and implement new conflict resolution processes so that outstanding
     conflicts with communities can be resolved. This should include
     renegotiating with local communities so that Free Prior and Informed
     Consent is properly and fairly obtained.  
Uphold all its obligations under the RSPO
     including compliance with New Planting Procedures, robust FPIC processes,
     resolving complaints, undertaking credible HCV assessments and GHG
     emission audits, and comprehensive reporting.

Strengthen its palm oil commitment to ensure
     that its policies and Standard Operating Procedures are consistent with
     the principles and implementation guidance for Free and Fair Labor in Palm
     Oil Production

Rapidly implement its commitments to eliminate
     third-party conflict palm oil suppliers from its downstream supply chains.

Montreuil, France; Nijmegen, Netherlands ",Victory for the climate and environment: French banks pledge not to finance mega coal projects in Australia's Galilee Basin,BNP Paribas ,France,Carmichael coal mine project ,mining - coal  | transport and infrastructure,Australia,"
Friends of the Earth France and its international partners today welcomed the commitment from the three top French banks - BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole and Société Générale - that they will not participate in the financing of multi-billion dollar coal projects slated for development in the Galilee Basin in Australia (1). The NGOs that have pressured the French banks not to get involved in these highly controversial projects are now calling on the banks to commit by December 2015 to putting an end to their financing of the coal sector completely.
BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole and Société Générale recently disclosed to FoE France that they will neither participate in the financing of the mega coal mining projects located in the Galilee Basin, nor will they finance any associated infrastructure. These commitments go further than those from a further eight international banks that committed last year not to finance the expansion of the Abbot Point coal export port (2) that threatens the Great Barrier Reef.
The climate issue is central to these decisions, campaigners believe. Taken together, the Galilee Basin projects in question are potentially the second biggest area of fossil fuel energy development in the world after China, and if realised would emit annually nearly as much CO2 as Germany, the world's sixth largest CO2 emitting country (3).
Responding to the move from BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole and Société Générale, Lucie Pinson from Friends of the Earth France commented:
""This is the first time that banks are committing to not finance projects in a whole region because of their environmental and climate impacts. The climate fight does not end here though. As welcome as these Galilee Basin commitments are, they are still a long way from reversing the 218% growth in French bank financing of the coal sector between 2005 and 2013. We will continue to put pressure on the banks to quit coal for good.""
According to FoE France, the three top French banks remain deeply involved in coal projects. All three feature in the top 25 financiers of the coal sector internationally, with BNP Paribas and Société Générale the fifth and seventh banks respectively in financing coal mines in Australia (4). Altogether BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole and Société Générale have been responsible for 94% of the 30 billion euros of French financing to the global coal sector in the period 2005 to April 2014 (5).
The French banks' commitments not to finance coal projects in the Galilee Basin were obtained following extensive engagement work carried out by FoE France with the support of more than 50 international NGOs (6).
Yann Louvel, Climate and Energy Campaign Coordinator for BankTrack, commented:
""The decision from the French banks is yet more evidence that investments in the coal sector are now extremely risky. The financing of one of the main energy sources responsible for climate change can also severely damage the reputation of big banks, particularly in France which will host the United Nations Conference of the Parties on climate change in December this year. It will now be the turn of Australian banks, particularly the Commonwealth Bank, and Standard Chartered, already involved in Adani's Carmichael project (7), to feel the pressure from international civil society over their refusal so far to pull out of the Galilee coal projects.""
After Société Générale's withdrawal last December from the Alpha Coal project, one of the nine Galilee Basin projects, the commitments from BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole and Société Générale mark a first step toward fossil fuels exit.
Lucie Pinson commented: ""But we need to speed ahead. Other coal projects could see the light of day thanks to French banks, but 88% of the world's total coal reserves must stay in the ground if we want to stay under the 2°C threshold. It is imperative that French banks commit this year to ending their financing of the coal sector."" (8)
Friends of the Earth France is calling on the customers of major banks to relay this demand to their banks on a dedicated website: jechangedebanque.eu (9).

Berkeley ","Barclays cuts ties with mountaintop removal coal, says MTR will be ""phased out"" soon",Barclays ,United Kingdom,Mountain top removal coal mining ,mining - coal ,United States,"
Barclays PLC, the number one bankroller of mountaintop removal (MTR) coal mining worldwide in 2013, has announced it is ending its financial support to the controversial practice. Barclays ruled out future financing for mountaintop removal projects and companies, citing MTR's negative environmental and social impacts, as well as market forces. In its policy statement, Barclays also forecast that MTR will soon be ""phased out"" entirely, as a result of increased market and regulatory pressures. The Barclays announcement comes just weeks after U.S.-based PNC Financial announced its own policy restricting financing for MTR coal producers.Full Barclays policy available here: http://bit.ly/1bRGcsMReacting to the news of the announcement, Rainforest Action Network Senior Climate and Energy Campaigner Ben Collins issued the following statement:""It's a big deal when the world's number one bankroller of mountaintop removal announces it has rescinded its support to this destructive practice. We're going to monitor Barclays's future financing decisions very closely to see how this policy is implemented, but overall the announcement is a very good step in the right direction.""It's also a powerful affirmation of what we've been saying for years to see Barclays predict that mountaintop removal will be 'phased out' as a result of both market and regulatory pressure. That stark assessment points to just how toxic and risky this practice has become in the eyes of the financial industry. However, our work is not done yet; we won't declare victory until mountaintop removal ends. Not only does mountaintop removal literally destroy entire mountains, but it leaves widespread devastation in its wake for communities across Appalachia.""Following this news, we will continue to exert pressure on laggard banks that put their financial support behind a practice that has no place in a civilized society. Banks like Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs should take note of the decision by Barclays and adopt their own policies to end financing for mountaintop removal.""Barclays was number one worldwide in financing for mountaintop removal coal producers in 2013, as documented in the 2014 Coal Finance Report Card, ""Extreme Investments, Extreme Consequences,"" released by Rainforest Action Network, the Sierra Club, and BankTrack. In 2013, Barclays financed $550 million in loan and bond transactions for mountaintop removal producers, acting as lead arranger in seven of these transactions.Rainforest Action Network (RAN) has campaigned to push numerous banks to stop financing mountaintop removal coal mining. JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, BNP Paribas, UBS, RBS, Société Générale, and PNC Financial have all previously adopted policies restricting financing for MTR, under pressure from RAN and other groups. The 2015 Coal Finance Report Card will be released later this month.     "

Nijmegen ",Credit Suisse breaching its own forest policy by financing Indonesian rainforest devastation,Credit Suisse ,Switzerland,APRIL ,forestry - pulp and paper,Indonesia,"
Credit Suisse is breaching its own 
rules on almost every count by financing pulp and paper company Royal 
Golden Eagle Group (RGE Group), an analysis by BankTrack shows.
 The analysis was published on the day that Greenpeace launched a  petition calling on the bank to cut its ties with the company.  RGE is the owner of Asia Pacific Resources International Holdings 
Limited (APRIL), named by Greenpeace as the leading driver of 
deforestation for pulp in Indonesia. Last month, over 125,000 people 
signed a Greenpeace petition which successfully pressured the Spanish 
bank Santander to commit to stop financing APRIL until it improves its 
record on deforestation.  The Dutch bank ABN Amro followed Santander early this month by giving 
Greenpeace in the Netherlands a similar commitment not to finance the 
company until it improves. This leaves Credit Suisse as the only known 
European bank linked to the RGE Group which has not stepped away from 
the company.  To date, Credit Suisse has declared that finance for the Group is 
consistent with the bank's Forestry and Agribusiness Policy, of which a 
summary is available on the bank's website. However, BankTrack has found
 evidence that  the company breaches every single one of the six 
exclusion criteria in the policy.  Credit Suisse's policy describes six ""excluded activities"":

Protected areas: APRIL breaches the bank's ban on doing business with forestry companies
 with operations in protected areas, including primary tropical moist 
forests and High Conservation Value forests.
Illegal logging: APRIL has breached numerous Indonesian laws, despite the bank's ban on 
banking companies ""where there are credible doubts as to the legality of
 such logging operations"".
Uncontrolled and/or illegal use of fire: Numerous fire hotspots have been found in APRIL concessions, and in 
2014 the company failed a government Compliance Audit on preventing 
forest and land fires. One APRIL supplier was categorised as ‘extremely 
non-compliant'.
Violation of local laws: APRIL
 has knowingly pulped natural forest wood from concessions whose 
licenses were issued through corrupt practices, in breach of the Credit 
Suisse policy not to finance forestry companies with ""credible evidence 
of material violations"" of local laws on environmental or social 
matters.
Major resettlements: While the bank has committed not to finance operations that require 
resettlement of substantial numbers of people, APRIL's operations have 
required the removal of at least three villages in Indonesia's Riau 
Province.
Human rights: In a number of cases, APRIL has been linked to violence used against 
local communities and indigenous groups protesting its operations, often
 by the company's own security services. 

BankTrack forests campaigner Merel van der Mark said: ""Credit
 Suisse cannot keep standing by a company which is devastating 
Indonesia's rainforest, when its forest policy should have excluded 
APRIL from the outset. Other banks have done the right thing in stepping
 aside from this company and building the pressure on it to stop the 
chainsaws and call an immediate moratorium on deforestation, as well as 
addressing its broader social conflicts and environmental impacts.""  BankTrack, together with Greenpeace, Rainforest Action Network and the 
Environmental Paper Network, is calling on Credit Suisse to follow the 
example set by Santander and ABN AMRO in recent weeks and commit not to 
provide further financial support to the RGE Group or APRIL.

Berlin ",Norwegian government pension fund still major coal investor,,,,,,"
NGOs have analyzed
the new holdings list of the Norwegian Government Pension Fund (GPF), which was
published last Friday. Since 2013, the coal investments of the world's largest
sovereign wealth fund have sparked an ongoing political debate, in which several
of Norway's political parties and the country's environmental organizations are
calling for an exclusion of coal stocks and bonds from the Pension Fund's
portfolio. As the GPF's manager NBIM (Norges Bank Investment Management) recently
announced a divestment from dozens of coal companies, the publication of the new holdings list was awaited with great anticipation.
Heffa Schuecking, director
of the German NGO urgewald, explains: ""As our 2014 report ‘Dirty &
Dangerous' analyzed the GPF's previous holdings, we were curious to see which
coal companies were dropped and how this affects the Pension Fund's overall participation
in the coal sector. Our first analysis shows that the GPF divested from 53 coal
companies, which is 1/3 of the total number of coal companies we found in the
portfolio last year. While this is a laudable first step, the overall result is
very disappointing as the GPF's total investments in the coal industry show
only a marginal decrease.""
According to
Schuecking, the GPF's coal holdings currently still amount to NOK 79 billion (€ 9.16 billion), which
is only 4.6% less than the NOK 82.7
billion (€ 9.59 billion), identified by urgewald in the GPF's 2013 portfolio. While
the divestment achieved by dropping 53 coal companies amounts to NOK 7.7
billion, half of this sum was used to either top up existing coal holdings or invested in new coal companies.
""This is well
illustrated by the development of the GPF's coal portfolio in China and India,""
says Truls Gulowsen of Greenpeace Norway. ""We are happy to see that the GPF
divested a total of NOK 729 million by dropping 13 Indian coal companies, but at the same time, it has increased
its investments in the Chinese coal sector by NOK 741 million. China's coal consumption is not only a huge threat
for our global climate, its coal companies are exhausting water resources and
causing enormously destructive impacts on people and the environment in China.""
Arild Hermstad
from the Future in Our Hands, Norway's largest environmental organization,
adds: ""Simply shifting destructive investments from one place to another cannot
be the solution. Our analysis shows that the GPF, for example, upped its stake
in the U.S. company Duke Energy from NOK 1.6 billion to NOK 3.3 billion in 2014. This company is under criminal charges for illegally dumping millions of gallons of toxic
coal ash into rivers, and will likely have to pay the second highest Clean
Water Act fine ever levied in the U.S..
What we need is real coal divestment and we need it now.""
""The only way to
achieve meaningful divestment, is to adopt a clear set of exclusion criteria,""
says Heffa Schuecking. The report ""Dirty & Dangerous"" co-published by
urgewald, the Future in Our Hands and Greenpeace Norway suggests 5 simple, but effective criteria for
eliminating large parts of the coal sector from the GPF's portfolio. To view
the 5 criteria, see page 40-41 of the report.
Referring to the coal
divestment criteria adopted by Norway's largest private pension Fund KLP in
2014, Truls Gulowsen of Greenpeace comments: ""It is shameful that Norway's private
pension funds are far more willing to take action on the coal issue than the
Government Pension Fund. Investing oil proceeds into the coal industry is the
worst possible use of our nation's money.""
""In the lead-up to
the Paris Climate Summit, the Norwegian Parliament has a unique chance to show
the world what responsible investment means by adopting exclusion criteria for
the dirtiest fossil fuel. The GPF's coal investments are tiny in relationship
to its total holdings, but the problems they cause around the world are huge,""
says Arild Hermstad of the Future in Our Hands.

Sydney ",Adani’s Queensland coal project in turmoil as doubts surface over State Bank of India loan,,,,,,"
Adani's
controversial Queensland Carmichael coal mine looks to be in jeopardy following reports that
the State Bank of India (SBI) is preparing to decide against giving the company
a planned $1 billion loan for the project due to concerns over its financial
viability.
In
reaction, Greenpeace Climate and Energy
Campaigner Nikola Casule said:
""State
Bank of India analysts seem to have realised that this project has no future.
The wider financial community has long ago recognised that the project is on
shaky financial ground. It is now up to the State Bank of India to make the
right decision and refuse to fund Adani's gamble with the hard earned money of
Indian taxpayers.
""We
already know that Adani's coal project represents a serious threat to the Great
Barrier Reef. Today's news emphasises that it is an investment blackhole as
well.""
Adani
has struggled to secure project financing for its $16.5 billion coal mine, rail
and port expansion. Major global banks, including HSBC, Deutsche Bank and
Goldman Sachs, have already refused to fund the project due to its damaging
impact on the Great Barrier Reef, currently under consideration by World
Heritage Body UNESCO for inclusion on its 'in danger' list.
Banks
all over the world are saying no to Adani. Even ANZ's own analysts are saying the project is not viable. Australians can rightly be asking why our own Big
Four Australian banks have so far failed to do the right thing by the Reef and
ruled out their involvement. No Australian bank should be financing the Reef's
destruction,"" Casule added. "

Jakarta ",Fair Finance Guide launches in Indonesia,Citi ,United States,,,,"
Koalisi Responsibank Indonesia, a coalition of Indonesian civil society organizations, is publishing the findings of its evaluation of the investment policies of the 8 largest national banks and the 3 largest foreign banks operating in Indonesia. The evaluation and ranking of the banks' published policies shows that both foreign and national banks receive insufficient scores, with the foreign banks scoring -on a scale of 1 to 10- under 5, and national banks scoring under 2.
Koalisi Responsibank Indonesia consists of Perkumpulan Prakarsa, YLKI (Yayasan Lembaga Konsumen Indonesia), Walhi (Wahana Lingkungan Hidup), Publish What You Pay (PWYP) Indonesia, ICW (Indonesian Corruption Watch) and Infid (International NGO Forum for Indonesia Development).Given the low scores of the 11 banks, Responsibank is deeply concerned about those results. Banks are failing to adequately address social and environmental elements in their core business policies.With the financial industry regulator tightly setting indicators for the stability and financial healthiness of banks, it is imperative that banks also take their social and environmental, social and human rights responsibilities seriously. They should strive to meet widely accepted international standards in those areas.
""Although some of the national banks assessed only operate in Indonesia, it does not mean that weshould tolerate lower standards for banks in financing projects and companies that have high risks of human rights abuses, igniting social conflicts and causing environmental degradation"", says Victoria Fanggidae, a representative of the Coalition from Perkumpulan Prakarsa. ""In this interconnected world that moves toward green economy, such arguments are not acceptable, because that kind of inward-looking attitude will not stand tougher competition in the future"", she added.
The Responsibank ranking reveals that HSBC has the best score of all 11 banks assessed, with arounded final score 4, while BNI and Danamon -both with a rounded final score of 1- are the two national banks that score highest. The other six national banks that were assessed received no score at all or score under 0.5. BCA, the biggest private bank in country, and Panin Bank, score lowest,with only 0.14 and 0.08 points respectively, on a scale of 1-10.
In comparative terms, the scores of Indonesian banks are the poorest among 7 countries that run a similar initiative called Fair Finance Guide International, in Brazil, Belgium, France, Japan, the Netherlands, and Sweden.
The Responsibank Indonesia Coalition calls banks in Indonesia to immediately embark on improving their investment policies, placing social, environmental and human rights concerns at the heart of those policies. Climate change, human rights, labor rights, tax and corruption are not minor issues that banks can ignore. By fully incorporating these issues in their policies, according to international and national standards, banks will improve their accountability and reduce their exposure to business risks. By being progressively more responsible, banks will be able to contribute to sustainable development and poverty reduction of the nation.
Responsibank also hope that the Roadmap of Sustainable Finance of the Financial Services Agency (OJK), will strengthen this drive for a more responsible, accountable, and sustainable banking sector in Indonesia.
 ""While the results of this first assessment are disappointing, we think that banks in Indonesia can choose for a ‘race to the top'. Banks can easily improve their ranking in next year's assessment by bringing their policies in line with internationally agreed standards. If they do so, this would signal that Indonesia's financial industry wants to catch up with global standards, and no longer holds the opinion that doing business can be totally separated from being responsible and ethical. People,planet and profit, the triple bottom line, and not just profit, are now inevitable for genuinely responsible businesses. Our banking sector has to move forward, and fast, or they will be left by their customers!"" says Huzna Zahir, Responsibank representative from YLKI. "

Jakarta ",Banks behind Indonesian palm oil tycoons revealed,HSBC ,United Kingdom,,,,"
New research
from TuK INDONESIA and Profundo has identified the bankers behind Indonesia's
controversial palm oil sector. International banks including HSBC of the UK and
OCBC of Singapore are identified as the main lenders to a group of 25 palm oil
businesses, all of which are controlled by wealthy tycoons, often via holding
companies in tax havens.
The rapid expansion of Indonesian oil palm plantations creates serious
environmental and social problems: vast amounts of valuable forests are
converted into plantations; habitats of protected species are endangered;
significant greenhouse gas emissions are caused by peatland development; and
many communities lose access to land which is crucial for their subsistence and
to which they have held legal or customary rights for generations.  To solve these problems, the driving forces behind the strong growth of the
palm oil sector - its owners and financiers - need to take their
responsibility. A new study, ""Tycoon-controlled oil palm groups in Indonesia"",
analyses the ownership and financing of 25 corporate business groups active in
the Indonesian palm oil sector, which account for a large part of the existing
plantations and which are developing very sizable landbanks into new
plantations.
The study,
conducted by TuK INDONESIA and Profundo, also reveals how the tycoons control
the business in the palm oil sector and how they get funding to develop their
businesses moving very rapidly, as well as financial institutions who provide
financing to the tycoons.  TuK INDONESIA's Program Director, Rahmawati Retno Winarni explained:
""There are 29 tycoons who control 25 business groups in the Indonesian
palm oil business, and in 2013 they possessed landbanks (planted and unplanted)
of 5.1 million hectares of oil palm land. This is a huge number, especially if
compared to total planted area of 10 million hectares. Of the land area that is
owned by the tycoons, as many as 3.1 million hectares, or sixty per cent, are
already planted.  ""The rapid pace of oil palm plantation expansion and ease of land acquisition
by these tycoons is facilitated by both domestic and foreign financial
institutions. With their support, tycoons are able to do expand plantations
faster and on a larger scale.
""This research
identifies a total of US$ 17.8 billion of new debt that has been provided to
these 25 palm oil groups in the period of 2009-2013. The biggest financiers are
international banks, with the largest being HSBC of the United Kingdom and OCBC
of Singapore. Among the domestic Indonesian banks, Bank Mandiri is the largest
lender,"" she concluded.
Business in this sector has generated numerous problems ranging from human
rights violations and land conflicts to extensive deforestation, and on top of
this, tax evasion and avoidance has also become a major concern. Wiko Saputra
of Prakarsa explains, ""Indonesia is ranked seventh in the illicit
financial flows and the palm oil industry has been one of the contributors,
booking USD 3.82 billion out of the total figure of USD 187.8 billion in the
last 10 years. Illicit financial flows result from tax evasion and tax
avoidance among other factors.""
The report
also highlights the need for further research into the strong ties of the palm
oil tycoons with political parties and governments at various levels, whose
growing power may be linked to corruption, tax evasion and the poor functioning
of democracy.

San Francisco ",PNC Bank policy on Mountaintop Removal a positive step,PNC ,United States,Mountain top removal coal mining ,mining - coal ,United States,"
Today PNC Financial Services Group joined the growing ranks of financial institutions that have officially sanctioned the coal mining practice known as mountaintop removal (MTR.) Citing concerns about the environmental and health impacts of MTR, as well as financial risks, PNC pledged to no longer extend credit to individual MTR mining projects or to firms with 25 percent or more of their production coming from MTR.
Rainforest Action Network (RAN), which has for years worked to push the financial sector to disavow MTR, hailed the new PNC policy as a positive indication that MTR is increasingly seen as being unbankable. ""PNC took a big step in the right direction today by acknowledging the serious health and environmental impacts of mountaintop removal, and by committing to reduce its exposure to this toxic practice. We'll be scrutinizing PNC's future financing decisions to see how this new policy is implemented,"" said RAN Climate and Energy Program Director Amanda Starbuck. ""Overall, we see today's news as indicative of a broader trend within the financial sector. Banks no longer want to be associated with a dangerous, abhorrent practice like mountaintop removal; there is an emerging financial industry consensus that these practices are unacceptable. Concretely, this means mountaintop removal companies will have a harder time securing financing to operate and expand in the future.""
With this new commitment, PNC joins the growing ranks of banks that have adopted policies to cut financing for top MTR producers. JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, RBS, BNP Paribas, and UBS have all cut ties with firms that specialize in mountaintop removal.
PNC's new MTR policy, released today as part of the PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. 2015 Corporate Responsibility Report (available online here), reads as follows:
""Driven by environmental and health concerns, as well as our risk appetite, we introduced a mountaintop removal (MTR) financing policy in late 2010 and subsequently enhanced that policy in 2014. As a result, our MTR financing exposure has declined significantly and will continue to do so moving forward. Overall, PNC's exposure to firms participating in MTR represents less than one-quarter of 1 percent of PNC's total financing commitments. Under the policy, PNC will not extend credit to individual MTR mining projects or to coal producers with 25 percent or more of their production coming from MTR mining.""
In an introduction to the 2015 CSR report, PNC CEO William Demchak also wrote, ""Our businesses implemented a number of important changes in 2014 to make environmental considerations a more prominent factor in PNC's lending while still balancing those considerations with the economic needs of the communities we serve. As part of these efforts, we enhanced PNC's mountaintop removal (MTR) financing policy. Due to environmental and health concerns, as well as our risk appetite, our MTR financing exposure has declined significantly over time, with current exposure to firms participating in MTR representing less than one-quarter of one percent of PNC's total financing commitments, and it will continue to decline.

Kampala/Brussels/London ",Give us back our land: Ugandan oil palm project taken to court over land-grab claims,BNP Paribas ,France,Wilmar International ,agriculture - palm oil ,Singapore,"
Press release
Kampala/Brussels/London,
 February 19 - Farmers in Uganda evicted by oil palm plantations are  
today presenting a lawsuit against a joint venture co-owned by oil palm 
giant Wilmar International. They are claiming restitution for their 
grabbed land and fair compensation for damages, three years after their 
land was taken for plantation development.   Friends of the Earth International is backing the communities' land grab
 case, filed after three years of dialogue with the government and the 
company which has failed to bring them justice.  John Muyiisa, one of the plaintiffs said, ""When I lost that land, I 
did not only lose my livelihood, I also lost my pension and a secured 
income for my children and grandchildren. I did all I could to get the 
land back - I even went to the office of the President of Uganda. Now I 
am looking to the court to provide us with justice.""  Frank Muramuzi, director of the National Association of Professional Environmentalists (NAPE)/Friends of the Earth Uganda said: ""Wilmar
 and the other palm oil companies are aware of the fact that communities
 have been displaced but have to date not resolved the problems. This 
project was sold to the residents of Kalangala with promises of 
employment and a brighter future. But they were not fairly compensated 
for the loss of their livelihoods, and now without access to land face a
 daily struggle to get by.""  The land grab occurred on the islands of Kalangala - situated in Lake 
Victoria, Uganda - in 2011, leaving at least one hundred small-scale 
farmers landless. Displaced smallholders received little compensation, 
if any.   The flagship oil palm project received initial seed money from the World
 Bank, which subsequently pulled out. Several governments also provide 
funding via the UN International Fund for Agricultural Development 
(IFAD).   Wilmar International receives money from several European banks and 
financiers. In 2014 EU and US financiers had a total of €371 million 
worth of shares in the corporation, and €1.1 billion in loans 
outstanding to them.  In the Netherlands, ING held more than €26 million
 in shares; the British bank HSBC held €298 million in loans, while BNP 
Paribas and Dutch Rabobank held €189 million and €111 million 
respectively. Deutsche Bank held €4 million in shares and €12 million in
 outstanding loans .  Friends of the Earth groups in Europe and the 
US have regularly brought the case to the attention of Wilmar 
International  and their European and US financiers .  Anne van Schaik, accountable finance campaigner at Friends of the Earth Europe conducted a field visit in January 2015 to talk to John Muyiisa and 
other affected people, as well as to local leaders and government 
officials in Kalangala. Her experience made it abundantly clear there 
must be strong regulation to prevent European financiers supporting such
 damaging projects.  Despite voluntary environmental and social governance commitments from 
Wilmar International and its financiers, peoples' rights continue to be 
violated by their palm oil projects.  Anne van Schaik said: ""This case clearly 
shows that we cannot expect companies and financiers to regulate 
themselves. We need strong rules for financiers in Europe to stop them 
from providing financial services to companies like Wilmar.""  John Muyiisa and the other plaintiffs are now waiting for a hearing date
 in court in Masaka . If the judge sustains their complaint, over 100 
farmers will receive compensation and the restitution of their land.  *** Notes:    The project is carried out by Oil Palm Uganda Limited (OPUL). OPUL 
is a subsidiary of Bidco Uganda, which holds 90% of its shares. Bidco 
Uganda is a joint venture formed between Wilmar International, Josovina 
Commodities and Bidco Oil Refineries, a Kenya-based company. Wilmar 
International holds at least 39% of the shares of the joint venture and 
is providing technical expertise for the project.    Additional financing for the project came from the Ugandan 
government and the UN International Fund for Agricultural Development

San Francisco ",RAN slams Citigroup over greenwashing,Citi ,United States,,,,"
In response to the announcement today of Citigroup's five-year sustainability strategy and ten-year sustainability financing commitment, Rainforest Action Network (RAN) Climate and Energy Program Director Amanda Starbuck issued the following statement:
""The number one financier of coal power in the U.S. wants people to look the other way while it bankrolls climate chaos and destruction. Citigroup's announcement of a new clean energy target today, absent a similarly ambitious commitment to reducing fossil fuel exposure, amounts to greenwashing, plain and simple. Citi was the number one lender and underwriter of coal-fired power in 2013, and the same year it also financed $434 million for mountaintop removal coal mining, which is poisoning communities in Appalachia. It's misleading for Citi to leverage its green investments as a PR opportunity while shirking its responsibility to communities and to the climate. There's no green energy on a dead planet.""
Citigroup announced a $100 billion clean energy target today as its ten-year sustainability financing commitment, but made no promises to reduce its exposure to fossil fuels, despite being the number one financier of coal-fired power in the United States, with a 23.6 percent market share and over $6.4 billion in lending and underwriting for coal power in 2013 alone, according to ""Extreme Investments, Extreme Consequences,"" the 2014 coal finance report card released by Rainforest Action Network, BankTrack, and the Sierra Club.

",Frozen Future: Shell investor briefing,,,Royal Dutch Shell ,oil and gas,Netherlands,"
On 29 January 2015, Royal Dutch Shell confirmed that it intends, subject to regulatory approval, to resume its US Arctic drilling programme at a cost for 2015 of at least $1bn. To date, Shell's Arctic programme has been a failure despite capital expenditure in excess of $6bn. 2012's drilling season beset by multiple operational failings was followed by a 'pause' for 2013 and a forced reversal of 2014 plans because of a US court decision.
This briefing examines Shell's Arctic experiences and outlines key operational and economic issues. We suggest questions investors should ask Shell, to understand whether the company has adequately assessed the various risks it faces. "

Panama ",Panama Suspends Construction of FMO-funded Barro Blanco hydroelectric dam over environmental and human rights abuses,FMO ,Netherlands,Barro Blanco dam project ,energy plants - dams,Panama,"
Following years of community protest, the Government of Panama temporarily suspended the construction of the Barro Blanco dam. The decision was publicly announced by Panama's Environmental Agency, ANAM, Monday. The indigenous communities whose land would be flooded by the dam had demanded the suspension for years. Although the decision comes when the dam's construction is near to completion, the Movimiento 10 de abril (M-10) is satisfied that steps are finally being taken to address their concerns.
""We have been intimidated and some of our members were even sued in court, but we have always persisted in claiming our right to be consulted on projects in our territory,"" said Manolo Miranda, representing the M-10. Since the new government took to power in 2014, there has been increased recognition of the communities' grievances, finally leading to this ground-breaking decision.
The Barro Blanco dam, once completed, is expected to flood homes, schools, religious, archaeological, and cultural sites in the Ngöbe-Buglé comarca (indigenous traditional territory). The project will require part of the indigenous Ngöbe communities currently living on the shores of the river to leave their land to which they have strong cultural ties.
ANAM finally decided to suspend construction after finding the project to be out of compliance  with its environmental impact assessment (EIA). The breaches include, among other things: the lack of agreement with the affected communities, absence of an approved archaeological management plan, repeated failures to manage sedimentation and erosion, poor management of solid and hazardous waste, and logging without permission.Role of Dutch and German development banks, FMO and DEG Two Dutch and German development banks, FMO and DEG respectively, have each invested USD 25 million in this project. They invested in this controversial dam despite the fact that local communities and civil society had raised concerns about the project with them. After critical reports by the UN Development Programme and the UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the current suspension is yet another very strong signal that FMO and DEG largely underestimated the adverse human rights and environmental impacts of the project.""FMO and DEG never came to the affected area to see whether the project complied with their policies and national laws,"" explained Manolo Miranda. This news comes at the same time FMO and DEG's Independent Complaints Mechanism (ICM) is investigating a complaint filed by local groups including the M-10, with support from Both ENDS and SOMO. The ICM's compliance report is expected to be published in mid-March.""FMO and DEG should respond publicly to the report. If the ICM finds that FMO and DEG failed to comply with their own policies, they must identify how to bring the project back into compliance with its policies or divest from the project completely."" said Anouk Franck, a senior policy advisor at Both ENDS.Next steps""The FMO asserts that when it finances projects, it has leverage to improve their clients' environmental and social performance,"" said Kris Genovese, a senior researcher at SOMO. ""FMO has failed to do so in the course of this project and more so, failed to assess the extent to which the affected community was left out of decision-making.""""We repeat our request to FMO to use its leverage to ensure that the human rights of the Ngöbe are finally respected. Free prior and informed consent is the bottom line. The failure to ensure FPIC in this project has led to unnecessary conflict. I hope FMO will learn that in future projects it needs to deal with human rights from the start,"" said Anouk Franck. "

Sao Paulo ",Idec launches the Brazil Fair Finance Guide,,,,,,"
On February 11th, Idec will launch the Brazilian website of
the Fair Finance Guide. The Guide aims to improve the impacts of
banks on society and the environment by providing a tool that assesses bank
policies in key transparency, sustainability, human rights, and social areas.
Developed by Idec
since 2010, the Guide is part of the work
conducted in the framework of the international Fair Finance Guide network, which is currently active in seven
countries (Brazil, Belgium, France, Indonesia, Japan, Netherlands, and Sweden). 
The launch event
of the Brazilian Guide (Guia dos
Bancos Responsáveis) brings together representatives of the seven FFG
coalitions, in addition to representatives of financial institutions and civil
society organizations.   The event will
take place at the Hotel Blue Tree Premium Paulista.  Speakers will include Ted van Hees (Coordinator
of FFGI), Imad Sabi (Coordinator of the Methodology and Research Group in FFGI),
and Peter Ras (Oxfam Novib and Coordinator of the FFG in the Netherlands). Idec
speakers will be Elici Maria Bueno Checchin (Executive Coordinator), Carlos
Thadeu de Oliveira (Technical Manager), Teresa Liporace, (Project Advisor),
Lucas Salgado (Design Consultant) and Ione Amorim (Economist).
The Guia is an online platform that presents
the assessment and scores of the transparency, tax, social and environmental
policies of the six largest Brazilian banks (Banco do Brasil, Bradesco, Caixa
Econômica Federal, HSBC, Santander and Itaú). 
The online platform also publishes Idec case studies on banking
practices of importance to consumers: opening accounts, credit contracting and
prepayment.  Other case studies that
examine different bank practices and investments are planned for publication
later this year.
The FFG assessment
analyzes and scores bank policies in thirteen major areas: arms, transparency
and accountability; taxes and corruption; food; nature; climate change, power
generation, mining, oil and gas, remuneration, forestry, human rights and labor
rights. The guide also offers interactive tools to compare banks and gives bank
clients the possibility to take action, by sending messages to their banks,
expressing their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the bank's policies in a
certain thematic area, and to switch to another bank which they find more
ethical and responsible.
The average score of Brazilian banks in the
thirteen themes was 3.6 out of a possible 10. The result reflects the maturity
of policies on certain issues, on the one hand, and a substantial gap in
developing policies for themes whose elements are not covered by national laws on
the other hand.
Banks scored better on their policies on
Nature (7.5) and Labor Rights (6.8).  Additional to  compliance with national laws, banks
recognized here the related risks and their proactive role to reduce and
prevent negative impacts. At the other end of the spectrum, the lack of
specific policies for arms resulted in the worst average score for Brazilian
banks (0.5).
The international policies of the HSBC group
contributed to compiling the score of HSBC in Brazil.  HSBC scored best on its policies in Brazil,
but the banking group has dominated the news in the last few days with stories
of its Swiss subsidiary's role in tax evasion.
The small differences between the lowest and
highest average bank scores in Brazil underline that the banking sector as a
whole has to improve its policies in a number of key areas, mainly arms,
climate change, forestry, and power generation.
Visitors to the
website can find out their bank's policy for companies operating in the arms
industry, or for the generation of renewable energy. The Fair Finance Guide
also investigates the policies of banks which carry social and environmental
risks, such as unfair labor relations, and deforestation.
""These tools
encourage you to take a more proactive role in the mobilization for more
responsible financial institutions, either by sending a complaint to a
particular bank or to congratulate the bank for good policies"" says Carlos
Thadeu de Oliveira, Technical Manager at Idec.  The FFG is a driver for increased transparency
and better sustainability policies. It will therefore contribute to the continuous
improvement of financial institutions and the banking system as a whole.   The FFG calls banks to adopt policies and commit
to best practices that go beyond the level required by law.   ""There is a recognition of the key role
of the financial sector in improving not only banking practices but also that
of companies that are its customers and suppliers, in order to ensure access to
a more just, balanced, ethical and sustainable world"" says Ione Amorim, the
Idec Economist.
 
The Guia will be updated in the fall of
2015.  FFGI will produce two case studies
in the course of 2015, the first on transparency, and the second on climate
change.  "

Stockholm ",Fair Finance Guide launches in Sweden,Nordea ,Finland,,,,"
The seven largest banks in Sweden have weak sustainability and social responsibility policy guidelines for their investments, an extensive first assessment conducted by the Swedish Fair Finance Guide coalition has concluded.
The findings were published on the Swedish Fair Finance Guide website which launched on 21 January. The website provides
an accessible tool for bank customers to judge the policies of their banks and
to take action on that basis.
""For a long time it has been difficult for consumers to get an
independent and comparable view of how their banks really act on these issues.
With the Fair Finance Guide they get a better insight, can make more informed
choices and request changes"", says Jakob König, project leader at the Swedish
Consumers' Association.
The results were presented and discussed in a public event attended by
civil society groups, bank representatives, media, and the Swedish Minister of
Financial Markets and Consumer Affairs.
The Fair Finance Guide is an international civil society initiative that
aims to focus public attention on the policies of banks, with the aim of
instigating a race to the top among banks to achieve better sustainability,
social, and human rights standards. In addition to Sweden, the Fair Finance
Guide is currently active in six other countries: Belgium, Brazil, France,
Indonesia, the Netherlands and Japan.
""Swedish bank policies are far from providing clear sustainability
requirements for their investments. There is a great deal of improvement
needed. Bank customers expect and demand this. Some banks are better than
others but, in general, no bank scores highly"", says Jakob König.
The Swedish banks commit to only 22% of Fair Finance Guide's list of
widely accepted international standards and conventions. This implies that they
lack many of the most important principles when investing. SEB is the bank that
commits to the most principles, with a score of 43%. Handelsbanken scores
lowest with 13%.
The assessed banks receive the lowest scores in the themes of
biodiversity, climate change, and energy. They score highest on human rights but
the average score in this area still does not reach 50% of the principles.
""Our study shows that if bank policies are weak and do not provide clear
guidelines, this could lead to investing in companies and projects around the
world which run counter to international targets for climate change or are associated
with violations of human rights"", warns Jakob König.
The banks' scores are published on Fair Finance Guide Sweden's
interactive website. Bank clients can now easily check their banks on different
sustainability issues and communicate their satisfaction or dissatisfaction
with those policies, with the option of switching to a more responsible bank.
 
An updated assessment is scheduled for the fall of 2015. ""By then, we
hope that banks would have made many improvements in their policies"", says
Jakob König. "

Amsterdam ",Dutch Banks and Insurers Fail to Take Recycling Seriously,,,,,,"
Dutch banks and insurers invest 69 times more in mining of metals than in recycling them for electronics, reveals a new case study by the Fair Bank and Insurance Guide. This practice runs contrary to the sustainability ambitions of the financial concerns, states the Fair Bank and Insurance Guide. Mining does substantial damage to nature and the environment, and more reuse of metals could make mining unnecessary in part. Moreover, responsible electronics processing would prevent environmental pollution associated with demolition yards and rubbish dumps in Africa and Asia.
60 million
Banks and insurers ING, Legal & General, Rabobank and Aegon have little invested in metal recycling. Just as ABN AMRO, they instead have invested billions euro's in the Glencore mining concern, a company which is controversial because of its environmental pollution and human rights violations, according to an earlier case study by the Fair Banking Guide. This is far more than the 60 million Euro's that all the banks and insurers surveyed invest in recycling in total. A number of insurers and the three large banks ING, ABN AMRO and Rabobank supplied no information on investments; these banks were therefore evaluated on the basis of public records. It is also striking that ASN and Triodos Bank scarcely invest in recycling either, nor in mining. ASN and Triodos Bank state that most businesses in the recycling sector do not meet their criteria, for example, for environmental pollution.
Opportunities
Due to the lack of proactive government policy and investment, the recycling sector has been slow to develop. This is the reason much electronic equipment leaves as scrap for Africa and China. The insurers ASR and Achmea and the NIBC bank are however active in the recycling sector. ASR even appears to invest more in recycling than in mining; NIBC invests only in metals recycling. ASR, Achmea, ASN, Triodos Bank and Rabobank also promote reuse and the ‘circular economy' to their business clients. ING does that as well, but at the same time invests 279 times more money in mining than in recycling. A number of banks indicated that they don't see opportunities in large investments because the sector is small and fragmented. Evert Hassink of the Fair Bank and Insurance Guide disagrees, ‘NIBC, ASR and Achmea show that investments in reuse instead of destructive mining is in fact possible; this shows that banks and insurers really can do more than point to the government or to the sector itself.'
Research question and commitments
The study by the Fair Bank and Insurance Guide shows how much financial institutions invest in mining and recycling companies and the degree to which banks and insurers make use of their influence. The study exclusively focused on metals used in electronics. As a result of this study, six banks and insurers (ASN, Aegon, ASR, NIBC, SNS Reaal and Triodos Bank) have committed to improve investments in recycling companies and/or related policies.

Nijmegen ",OJK publishes a Roadmap for Sustainable Finance in Indonesia,,,,,,"
On December 5th, the
Indonesian Financial Services Authority (OJK) and the Ministry of Environment
and Forestry (KLHK) launched a ""Roadmap for Sustainable Finance in Indonesia"". The
goal of the Roadmap is to determine which measures need to be taken to improve
the sustainability of finance in Indonesia, and to have these implemented by
2024. It contains a detailed work plan for the period of 2015-2019, which will
apply to all institutions that fall under the authority of the OJK, namely the
banking, the capital market and the Non Bank Financial Services Industry (IKNB)
sectors. The Roadmap is part of the Master Plan for Indonesia's Financial
Service Sector (MPSJKI) which is due to be published by the end of 2015.
The activities set
forth in the work plan are divided in 3 focus areas:
1.  Increase the supply of sustainable financing: 
Regulatory
support and incentives (both fiscal and non-fiscal) should encourage innovations
in developing environmentally friendly products and investments in priority
sectors. This will include instruments like targeted loans and guarantee
schemes, green lending models, green bonds, a green index and a special focus
on supporting the national energy security plan.
2. Increase the demand for sustainable financing
products:
Targeted
outreach campaigns and socialization programs should make the market more aware
of the importance of risk management and mitigation and of the financing
potential for environmentally friendly projects.
3. Increase the oversight and coordination of sustainable
finance implementation:  
Financial
institutions will be required to adopt risk management policies governing the
social and environmental aspects of their activities, they will have to observe
the balance of the 4Ps (pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-poor and pro-environment) in
all their activities and they will have to publish an annual sustainability
report.
The implementation of the Roadmap will be a
joint effort of the OJK, together with at least 7 ministries, the Indonesia
Stock Exchange and Law Enforcement Agencies.  To facilitate the coordination and the exchange of information, a Forum
on Sustainable Finance will be organized at least twice a year, with all
relevant stakeholders.

Berkeley ","Banks Support Ethiopian Bond Sale; Monies Targeted for Destructive Dams, Land Grabs",Deutsche Bank ,Germany,Gibe III dam ,energy plants - dams,Ethiopia,"
On Dec. 4, Ethiopia raised $1 billion from the initial sale
of its first international sovereign bond issue. The bond sale was managed by
JP Morgan Chase and Deutsche Bank AG.
The proceeds from the bonds will be used for a number of
controversial dam projects that are linked to land and water grabs, forced
resettlement and human rights abuses, and major reductions in river flows to
downstream nations that could lead to water conflicts in future.
On Oct. 7, Ethiopia's Finance Minister Sufian Ahmed told BusinessWeek that most of
the capital raised will be used to develop sugarcane plantations (many of which
are associated with land grabbing in Ethiopia), the 6,000-megawatt Grand
Renaissance Dam on the Nile River, and rail projects. The Nile dam has greatly increased tensions
over that shared river with downstream Egypt.
WorldBulletin has quoted government officials stating that
part of the financing for Gibe 4 and Gibe 5 planned for the Omo River will come
through the bond sales. The bond could be used to finish financing Gibe 3  as
well, which is more than 85% complete but is rumored to be stalled due to lack
of financing.  
These
projects violate the safeguard policies of all the major financial
institutions, and likely the sustainability guidelines for these banks. JP
Morgan and Deutsche Bank are risking their reputations.
The Ethiopian government and
related dam building agencies are notoriously closed, and virtually no
information about its dam projects is shared, not even with downstream
neighbors that will be directly affected. It is a situation that discourages
good project planning and an open environment for experts to raise concerns,
de-emphasizes sustainable development for directly affected people, and fosters
corruption.
Further informatiion on these projects:
Omo Valley Dams and Land Grabs
The Gibe 3 Dam, now under construction in the Lower Omo River, will have devastating impacts on the fragile ecosystems of the Lower Omo Valley andLake Turkana (Kenya), and will impoverish hundreds of thousands of indigenous people who depend on these ecosystems for their survival. Once Gibe 3 has been completed, Ethiopia plans to build the  Gibe 4 and 5 dams on the Omo River.
These projects will bring huge changes to Lake Turkana in Kenya - impacts that will be even harder to address if Gibe 4 and 5 are built. When water abstractions for agricultural expansion are figured in, the result could be a massive shrinking of Lake Turkana; experts say it will mimic the Aral Sea disaster in scope.
The Gibe dam cascade alone will destroy the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people in the Lower Omo and around Lake Turkana by eliminating flood-recession farming, drowning grazing areas, and undermining fishing activities. The dam enables the development of approximately 400,000 hectares of plantations, including 245,000 hectares of irrigated sugar plantations on land that indigenous tribes have been using for agriculture and grazing.  The Government of Ethiopia has forcibly resettled local populations through what it calls a ""villagization"" program to make room for these large-scale plantations. Once villagized, they often no longer have access to the lands and river that once provided their source of food and identity. The resulting collapse of livelihoods will lead to widespread hunger and an increase in conflict over scarce resources.
Despite these drastic impacts, the Government of Ethiopia continues to publicly insist that the Omo developments will have no impact on Lake Turkana. Yet Gibe 3's environmental and social assessment stops at the Ethiopia border, and did not analyze impacts on the Lake.
Grand Renaissance Dam
Ethiopia is also building one of the largest dams in the world, the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), on the River Nile near the Sudan border. The dam will flood 1,680 square kilometers of forest in northwest Ethiopia, displace approximately 20,000 people, and create a reservoir that will hold around 70 billion cubic meters of water - equivalent to the entire annual flow of the Blue Nile at the Sudan border. The potential for conflict is probably the main reason international funders have shown no interest in supporting the project.
Although it is Africa's biggest dam project and will have lasting impacts on its longest river, the GERD has been developed under a veil of secrecy. The dam will impact Ethiopians and downstream neighbors, yet its planning process has been top-down and unilateral. The public and dam-affected people have not been given a meaningful opportunity to critique the project or process. The Ethiopian government has stated it will not make changes to the project.
Although Ethiopia says the dam will have no ill effects on downstream neighbors' water supply, there is no denying that the dam will give the upstream country greater control over the river's flow. A major concern is how filling the huge reservoir will affect water security in Egypt, which relies almost totally on the Nile for its water supply. Depending on how long it takes to fill the reservoir (it has been estimated it will take from 5-7 years), the Nile flow into Egypt could be cut by 12-25% during the filling period. One hydrologist estimates that the reservoir could evaporate 3bn cubic meters of water a year - three times Egypt's annual rainfall, and enough to meet the basic needs of up to half a million people. Damming a shared river in a secretive and unilateral fashion goes against best practices for managing shared rivers. Says Mohamed Allam, former minister of irrigation and water resources in Egypt: ""This is not just about Egypt and Sudan. International rivers are governed by laws and conventions, in accordance with which any action that affects water quotas requires advanced notice and guarantees against possible harm."" "

Brussels/Amsterdam ",Bumitama cuts ties with illegal palm oil plantation following Friends of the Earth pressure,Rabobank ,Netherlands,Bumitama ,agriculture - palm oil ,Indonesia,"
Brussels/Amsterdam, December 16 - Indonesian palm oil company Bumitama announced in September 2014 that it has terminated its contract with an illegal palm oil plantation in Borneo, from which it is no longer purchasing palm oil. This decision followed a public campaign by Milieudefensie / Friends of the Earth Netherlands and Friends of the Earth Europe, including a complaint submitted to the Dutch National Contact Point for the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) against Rabobank, which has provided a number of loans to Bumitama. 
On December 16, the National Contact Point announced to Milieudefensie and Friends of the Earth Europe that it offers ""its good offices"" to facilitate a dialogue between Friends of the Earth and Rabobank.
Anne van Schaik, accountable finance campaigner at Friends of the Earth Europe, said: ""It is good news that Bumitama has terminated its contract with the illegal plantation. However, it took almost a year of intensive campaigning against its financiers such as Rabobank.
Friends of the Earth Europe and Milieudefensie want the bank to be more transparent in its sustainability policy - including how the bank implements, monitors and evaluates this policy. FoEE and Milieudefensie requested in their complaint that Rabobank implements its own Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) policy in a more transparent and effective way.
Now that the complaint merits further consideration at face value, the National Contact Point will facilitate a dialogue with stakeholders, after which a final statement will be published by the National Contact Point. The procedure will focus on the implementation of the Palm Oil Supply Chain Policy and on how such implementation relates to the Guidelines. The NCP is of the opinion that this may help clarify the OECD due diligence recommendations for the financial sector regarding loans.

Lima ",Hundreds of civil society groups demand human rights are enshrined in 2015 climate agreement,,,,,,"
More than 200 civil society organisations representing hundreds of thousands of people from 40+ countries, including BankTrack, and 76 leading human rights experts, are calling on ministers meeting in Lima to enshrine ‘human rights for all' in the next year's global climate agreement. In an open letter to top decision-makers published today, individuals and organisations including CARE International, AIDA, CIEL, WWF, 350.org, the World Council of Churches, Greenpeace, Fiji Women's rights movement, the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts plus many others, warn that ""a safe climate is critical to the full enjoyment of human rights, including the rights to life, health, food, water, adequate housing, and self-determination."" Yet, the groups warn, there is also increasing recognition by the UN Human Rights Council and others that ""climate change and certain actions being taken to address climate change interfere with the enjoyment of human rights protected under international law."" With negotiations for the 2015 Paris agreement underway, now is the time to fully integrate rights protections into the foundations of the new treaty, the groups say. They call on ministers to:

Recognise the adverse effects of climate change on the enjoyment of human rights, and to adopt urgent and ambitious mitigation and adaptation measures to prevent further harm. 
Include language in the 2015 climate agreement  that provides that the Parties shall, in all climate change related actions, respect, protect, promote, and fulfill human rights for all.
Launch a new UNCCC ‘work programme'  to ensure that human rights are integrated into all aspects of climate actions.

Kit Vaughan, Director of Climate Change at leading development organisation CARE International says: ""Climate change is a global injustice and one of the greatest human rights challenges of our time. At CARE, we are deeply concerned about the devastation that climate change is already causing, its disproportionate impact on the world's poorest people, and on the environments on which we all depend. We are standing with civil society to call for human rights to be the basis for an effective and trusted climate deal."" Alyssa Johl, Senior Attorney, Climate and Energy Program,  Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL) says: ""Human rights is at the core of what is being discussed here in Lima, as climate change threatens the lives and livelihoods of peoples and communities around the world. If the international community does not take action to fully consider and integrate human rights into these negotiations, we will miss a critical opportunity to achieve an effective, sustainable and just outcome next year in Paris."" John Knox, UN-affiliated independent expert on Human Rights and the Environment, says: ""Climate change cannot be effectively addressed without protecting human rights, which is why people are increasingly speaking out on this critical issue. Only yesterday, 76 human rights experts urged governments to recognise the vital importance of human rights. Until we get a signal that we are being heard, we will not stop beating the human rights drum, all the way to Paris."" Maria Jose Veramandi, Senior Attorney and Coordinator of the Human Rights  and Environment Programme at the Interamerican Association for Environmental Defense (AIDA) says: ""Rights must be respected in all climate-related actions. The Kyoto Protocol Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is just one example of where things can go wrong. We have seen a growing number of rights violations as the CDM has started work, including during the construction of the Santa Rita dam in Guatemala, which has led to violence and repression against indigenous communities and the death of two children. We will not accept a climate-impacted world in which human rights are ignored.""     "

Berlin ",Dirty profits – How companies and financial institutions gain billions at the expense of people and the environment and shirk their responsibilities,,,,,,"
In anticipation of the International Day of Human Rights (10.12). FACING FINANCE is launching their new report entitled DIRTY PROFITS 3. The report is a joint project by civil society organisations, with research and information provided by over 30 authors from 10 countries.  The report documents sample cases of serious violations of 
internationally established norms and standards. It investigates 25 
controversial companies that in 2013 had a joint revenue of approx. 
€4.196 trillion and achieved net profits of €450 billion. Companies that
 have been selected include some that are blacklisted on investors 
exclusion lists, others that do not comply with international or 
national law, or those that face serious allegations by the media or 
civil society. DIRTY PROFITS 3 also investigates the extent to which 
these companies are supported by European financial institutions.  ""It is apparent that human rights violations, corruption, exploitation 
and environmental and climate destruction still form part of the 
business models of multinational corporations and their financial 
investors"" states Thomas Kuechenmeister of the NGO Facing Finance, an 
organisation that stands up for human rights and environmental concerns.  The report documents pharmaceutical companies, which have been involved 
in serious and widespread corruption, and whose poor clinical trials in 
India resulted in thousands of victims. The report also looks at 
companies that are responsible for massive CO2 emissions contributing to
 the destruction of the earth's climate. ""Companies such as Chevron, 
Shell, Gazprom and Coal India belong to a global group of companies 
producing some of the highest CO2 emissions. Those who accept and 
finance these business practices say goodbye to limiting global warming 
at a maximum of two degrees. It is time for banks and investors to stop 
financing those companies"" stressed Regine Richter, of urgewald.  Moreover, the NGO criticises the abuse of labour rights in the textile 
industry. ""As long as textile companies such as GAP or Walmart shirk 
their responsibility for the workers in their supply chain and as long 
as they continue to undermine sector-wide reforms, the workers will 
continue to toil under inhumane conditions in unsafe factories with 
poverty wages"", stressed Silvie Lang of the Clean Clothes Campaign 
Switzerland, in relation to the refusal of numerous brands to commit to 
the Bangladesh Accord on Fire and Building Safety or to provide 
compensation to victims of factory accidents.  Furthermore, the report also looks at the soaring demand for 
agricultural land. Since 2000, more than 49 million hectares of land in 
developing countries have either been leased to companies, or are 
currently being negotiated. ""We urgently need legal protocols which 
ensure that banks, pension funds and other investors no longer provide 
financial services to companies engaged in illegal land-grabbing or 
environmental destruction"" , says Anne van Schaik of Friends of the 
Earth Europe.  Using the example of the company SodaStream, the report discusses the 
operations of international business enterprises and Israeli companies 
operating in the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, described as illegal under international law. ""Israeli and 
international companies profit from the occupation, strengthen Israeli 
hold over Palestinian lands and inhibit or even prevent the development 
of independent Palestinian businesses in the occupied territories"", 
claims Rona Moran of the Tel Aviv based Research Center - Who Profits.  The report analyses legal sentences and fines levied on banks, such as 
BNP Paribas and criticises the concurrent lack of control over financial
 institutions. "" If we want to prevent the banking crisis of 2008 coming
 back and the many other banking scandals, we need reforms of the 
banking system and more civil oversight of financial decision makers"", 
claims Frank Vanaerschot of the organisation FairFin from Belgium.  DIRTY PROFITS 3 analyses the role the European financial institutions 
play for these companies. On the one hand, through their financing, 
financial institutions such as Barclays, Deutsche Bank, HSBC or BNP 
Paribas benefit from and enable the implementation of projects that 
abuse human rights and environmental standards. On the other hand, 
through their share- and bond holdings, financial institutions and their
 customers also profit from these abuses.  During the research period (January 2012 - August 2014) the financial 
ties between the 25 companies and the 24 financial institutions amounted
 to approx. €144 billion, as is shown in the research provided by the 
Dutch organisation PROFUNDO. Of that amount, €67 billion can be 
attributed to the major carbon emitters and a further €29 billion to 
controversial mining and commodity companies.  The FIs' own internal guidelines do not prevent such investments, as 
they are too often non-binding, or not applied. In addition, binding 
legal regulation is currently lacking. DIRTY PROFITS 3 documents an 
array of voluntary commitments of companies and financial institutions 
that they consider sufficient. ""Unfortunately the voluntary commitments 
of financial institutions and companies are not sufficient to prevent 
massive human rights abuses and environmental destruction,"" argues 
Thomas Kuechenmeister who supports the creation of further legal 
provisions for corporations and financial institutions to ensure human 
rights issues are incorporated into global business and financial 
decision making. DIRTY PROFITS 3 advocates for a rapid implementation of
 the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. "

Nijmegen ",Call for banks to divest from APRIL,ABN AMRO ,Netherlands,APRIL ,forestry - pulp and paper,Indonesia,"
The Environmental Paper Network and BankTrack have sent letters to 26 banks to express their concerns regarding the pulp and paper companies Asia Pacific Resources Limited (APRIL), Toba Pulp Lestari (TPL) and their sister companies under the conglomerate Royal Golden Eagle Group (RGE), due to their involvement in large scale deforestation and social conflicts. Research has demonstrated that these companies are involved in illegalities under Indonesian law, under Chinese banking regulations and under international norms. In fact, APRIL does not even respect its own Sustainable Forest Management Policy, which it adopted on January 28th, 2014.
Read the full letter here.
In the letter, the organizations ask assurance from the banks that they have no significant involvement with APRIL or any of its sister companies, and that they will not do so until the RGE group ends its illegal and unsustainable environmental and social practices and achieves a performance consistent with the EPN Performance Milestones.
In the past six years, banks have invested at least USD 1.5 billion dollar in APRIL alone. Below is a list of banks that have received a letter because they are among the biggest financiers of the pulp and paper sector or because they are known for having invested in APRIL:
ABN Amro - The Netherlands

Agricultural Bank of China - China

Barclays - United Kingdom

Bank of America - United States of America

Bank of China - China

Bayonne, Montreuil, Paris ","Under citizen pressure, Société Générale drops out of the Alpha Coal project",Société Générale ,France,GVK ,energy plants - coal | mining - coal  | oil and gas,India,"
Société Générale announced that it has dropped out of the gigantic Alpha Coal dodgy deal, finally throwing in the towel on the controversial coal mine in Australia. This is the first and most important victory for citizen movements demanding the withdrawal of what activists have called a ""climate bomb"". Activists are now calling on Australian and Indian promoters to definitively cancel the project. The day before a national day of action, organised by Les Amis de la Terre (Friends of the Earth France), Attac France and Bizi!, Société Générale  announced its withdrawal from the project. In an e-mail from Jean-Michel Mépuis, Group Head of Sustainable Development, the bank stated that ""in the context of the Apha Coal project's delay, Société Générale has decided, in agreement with GVK-Hancock, to suspend its mandate. The bank has therefore no involvement with the project. You can relay this message in your networks"" . Over the past year, Friends of the Earth France, Attac France and Bizi! have called for Société Générale to end its advisory mandate and not commit to any financing for the open-pit mine project in Australia's Galilee Basin. The project included a railway and port expansion in the heart of the Great Barrier Reef. Activists have dubbed the project a ""climate bomb""  because of its disastrous environmental impacts; development of the coal project would have led to the release of 1.8 billion tons of CO2, thus damning  efforts to limit global warming. The coal project would have also negatively impact local communities and biodiversity.Prior to the announcement of Société Générale's decision, NGOs had occupied Société Générale branches last Monday, staging demonstrations in Pau and Paris as part of the international day of fasting for the climate. These protests coincided with the grand opening of the annual COP20, an international climate conference being held in Lima. In protest of fossil fuels and the Société Générale's role in the Alpha Coal project, ""picketing"" actions were planned to take place at more than ten Société Générale branches across France tomorrow, from Bayonne, Bourges, Chambéry to Concarneau, Limoges, Mâcon, Nîmes, Paris, Pornichet, Tours...While the COP continues in Peru, the work of Friends of the Earth France, ATTAC and Bizi! demonstrates that citizen action can concretely influence the predatory practices of banks and multinationals and score victories in the fight to overcome the climate challenge! News of Société Générale's decision to pull out of the project is just the first step in ensuring that the Alpha Coal project is stopped. Increasing international pressure against the Australian and Indian project developers, GVK-Hancock, will be essential for ensuring that this ""climate bomb"" project does not go off. After this first victory, our NGOs will continue their actions in 2015 for the climate, particularly against banks and multinationals involved in the coal sector, as this sector is the chief source of CO2 emissions in the world.

Oslo ",NGOs Slam Expert Group’s Report on Coal and Oil Investments of the Norwegian Government Pension Fund,Norges Bank ,Norway,,,,"
""Given the mandate and the composition of the Expert Group, our expectations were low to begin with,"" says Arild Hermstad of the Future in our Hands, ""but the Expert Group's report has managed to underwhelm even these very low expectations. The report does not address or even acknowledge the fact that the Pension Fund's investments have real and tangible impacts on our climate. And it refutes the idea that large investors have the responsibility to realign their investments with the goal of limiting global warming to 2°C. This is in stark contrast to the latest calls by IPCC, the World Bank and the International Energy Agency."" The 6 person Expert Group, led by the former Norwegian finance ministry bureaucrat Martin Skancke, yesterday presented its 70 page report ""Fossil Fuel Investments in the Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global: Addressing Climate Issues through Exclusion and Active Ownership"". The report was issued just two weeks after Norway's largest private pension fund KLP had announced its divestment from major coal-based utilities and coal mining companies. ""It is shameful that Norway's largest private pension funds are far more willing to take responsible action on climate change than Norway's sovereign wealth fund,"" says Truls Gulowsen of Greenpeace Norway. ""The recommendations of the Expert Group are simply business as usual. Instead of a meaningful divestment from the most carbon-intensive parts of the fossil fuel industry, the report tells us active ownership is the answer. It completely ignores the fact that Norges Bank's active ownership activities on climate have up to now shown no discernible results."" The report only advocates an extremely limited case-by-case approach towards exclusion. ""This approach is completely unacceptable and would at best lead to the exclusion of only a handful of companies. It is far too little and too late to truly address climate concerns,"" says Gulowsen. Just last week, the Future in our Hands, Greenpeace Norway and the German NGO Urgewald published the report ""Dirty & Dangerous"" which puts forward concrete criteria for a divestment of the Government Pension Fund from the coal sector.  ""It is hard to take the Expert Group's report serious,"" comments Heffa Schücking, director of Urgewald. She criticizes that the Expert Group lumps together the very different issues confronting the transportation and energy sectors, and completely fails to differentiate between coal and oil. ""There is no point in setting up an Expert Group if all it does is parrot industry claims about future demand in fossil fuels. Instead of exploring different options for divestment from the most carbon-intensive parts of the industry, the Expert Group simply claims it would be too difficult to conceptualize consistent criteria - something we have just done in our own study. The way we see it, the Expert Group absolutely failed to do its homework,"" she adds. What worries the NGOs most, however, is that the Expert Group, the Norwegian Finance Ministry and Norges Bank all fail to recognize that the Pension Fund's investments are helping to fuel an ongoing boom of the coal industry and to lock-in energy and mining infrastructure that may undermine all chances of maintaining climate stability. ""When buying new shares of Coal India or bonds issued by Sinopec to finance its planned US$ 10 billion coal-to-gas facility, the Government Pension Fund is helping to put us all on the highway to hell,"" says Schücking. ""The Pension Fund is currently invested in companies responsible for 42% of world coal production. Coal is easily replaceable and it is time to stop pretending that these destructive investments don't contradict Norway's climate obligations or won't affect the future of Norwegian people,"" demands Hermstad. ""Luckily, the final decision is up to the Norwegian Parliament,"" says Gulowsen ""and the majority here is in favor of divestment from coal. We will do our best to ensure that this majority is not swayed when it comes to a final decision next spring. Our own study shows not only that coal divestment can be done, but that it can be done easily.""      "

Geneva ","Banks not yet living up to UN human rights principles, finds BankTrack",ABN AMRO ,Netherlands,,,,"
As the world's largest gathering on business and human rights takes place in Geneva, new research from BankTrack has found that global banks are making slow progress in implementing human rights standards, and are failing to live up to their responsibilities completely in some areas. The findings are presented in a new report titled ""Banking with Principles?"".


The report assesses 32 large global banks against the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which set out the responsibilities of businesses to respect fundamental human freedoms. The report shows that, while some progress has been made since the Principles were launched in mid-2011, major gaps remain.


Progress has been particularly poor in developing adequate reporting on human rights impacts, and in the establishment of grievance mechanisms through which people affected by banks' activities can complain. The Guiding Principles call on all types of businesses to establish or join such complaint mechanisms - however none of the banks have yet taken this step.


Of the 32 banks covered, half were found to have developed human rights policies that include a clear commitment to respect human rights. This is one of the most fundamental requirements of the Guiding Principles. A majority (17 out of 32) did not provide any reporting on human rights developments or impacts at the bank. None of the banks covered were found to have grievance mechanisms in place, meaning there are no transparent means for communities or individuals to raise complaints when they feel banks have caused or contributed to a human rights abuse. None had a clearly described process in place to remedy even those human rights abuses that the banks identified themselves.


""To date, banks' efforts to implement the UN Guiding Principles have mainly revolved around producing discussion papers on the best way forward. BankTrack has welcomed these discussions, but some three and a half years on from the launch of these Principles, it is time to move onto implementation"", said Ryan Brightwell, the report's author.


""Banks should now take steps to clearly show how they place impacts on rights-holders at the centre of their approach to human rights"", added Andreas Missbach of the Switzerland-based Berne Declaration, who presented the report at the UN Forum on Business and Human Rights in Geneva yesterday.

 

Banks were assigned a score of between 0 and 12 depending on their performance against 12 criteria. The Dutch co-operative bank Rabobank scored the highest, with eight points, followed by Credit Suisse and UBS. Banks scoring less than two points included HSBC, Deutsche Bank and Bank of America, alongside the Chinese banks. The average score obtained was just three out of 12.

San Francisco ","Controversial Palm Oil Stock Offering Hides Serious Environmental, Financial Risks",,,BW Plantations ,agriculture - palm oil ,Indonesia,"
Indonesian palm oil firm BW Plantation (BWPT) approved last week a 
USD $900 million share rights offering in a bid to finance its merger 
with Green Eagle Holdings (GEH). New stock not purchased by existing 
shareholders will be traded on the Jakarta Stock Exchange (IDX) from 
Monday December 8. Already lagging behind its competitors who have 
committed to zero deforestation policies, BWPT has failed to declare to 
investors the serious environmental, social and financial risks involved
 with deforesting and planting over its massive new land bank.
Rainforest Action Network (RAN) has published an in-depth backgrounder/briefing document titled Conflict Palm Oil Case Study PT BW Plantation (BWPT) $900 Million Stock Offer Warning: Investors 
Need Greater Disclosure of Environmental, Social and Legal Risks.
The deal expands BWPT's holdings from just under 100,000 ha to over 
400,000 ha, making it Indonesia’s third largest palm oil company listed 
on the IDX. However, 75% of the new land bank - with holdings in Papua, 
Sulewesi, West, East and South Kalimantan and Sumatra - is unplanted and
 likely includes large tracts of primary forests, Indigenous and local 
community lands, and areas of carbon-rich peatlands. 
Tom Picken of Rainforest Action Network said, “The last thing 
Indonesia needs is a near-billion dollar injection of cash that will 
simply fuel Conflict Palm Oil production. We encourage potential 
investors to steer clear of this controversial deal until BWPT discloses
 the true extent of risks, and publicly commits to no deforestation, no 
exploitation, and no peatland expansion across its entire operations.
Publicly available information on GEH plantations should raise alarm 
bells for investors. A basic review of available satellite data and 
local media reports indicates aggressive clearance of High Carbon Stock 
(HCS) forest since 2010, orangutans needing to be rescued from a 
Kalimantan concession two weeks ago, at least one case of serious labour
 rights violations this year in Papua, as well as a number of community 
conflicts.
Picken added, “BWPT is already failing to comply with its obligations
 under the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) relating to new 
plantations. Adding the Green Eagle operations into the mix may 
seriously jeopardise BWPT’s eligibility to remain a member of RSPO at 
all, judging by the little information that is in the public domain 
highlighting numerous scandals in Green Eagle plantations.
“Aside from being a disaster in the making for the climate, local 
communities and the environment, this deal is a risky gamble for 
investors. That’s because this offering completely ignores the changing 
business climate. There has been a tide of deforestation-free 
commitments from major players in this arena recently, including BWPT’s 
two largest buyers of Crude Palm Oil (CPO) -- Wilmar International and 
Golden Agri-Resources (GAR), which make up almost half of BWPT’s sales. 
Unless BWPT gets into line with these improved palm oil standards, then 
it will lose its biggest clients while investors could see their stock 
plunge.” "

Oslo ",NGOs release Damning Report on Norwegian Government Pension Fund’s Coal Investments,Norges Bank ,Norway,Coal  ,mining - coal ,India,"
The report ""Dirty & Dangerous"" takes a deep look into the coal portfolio of the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, the Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global (GPF). The report launches at a public event in the Norwegian Parliament today (10 am. CET) and comes in the midst of a political debate in Norway around a possible divestment of the Government Pension Fund (GPF) from the coal sector. The report reveals that the Pension Fund's holdings in the coal industry are much larger than previously acknowledged. According to the NGOs' research, the GPF holds assets of over NOK 82.2 billion (€ 9.7 billion) in the coal sector, of which NOK 68.7 billion are in the form of shares and NOK 13.5 billion are held in bonds. In January of this year, the Pension Fund's manager, Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), announced that the GPF's ownership in coal miners amounts to only NOK 2.5 billion (€ 296 million). ""This is a gross understatement,"" says Heffa Schuecking, director of the German NGO Urgewald and author of the report. According to Schuecking, the way NBIM defines a coal company is so narrow that it leaves out most of the coal producers in its portfolio. The report identifies 158 companies from the coal industry in the GPF's 2013 portfolio. ""If you add up the annual production of these companies, they amount to 3.3 billion tons of coal - that is 42% of global coal production. While the Norwegian government is doing its best to ensure that the 2015 Paris Climate Summit results in effective international action, its sovereign wealth fund is helping to bury any chance of climate stability beneath a mountain of coal"", says Schuecking. ""We were not only shocked by how much, but also by what we found,"" says Truls Gulowsen of Greenpeace Norway. Greenpeace East Asia had recently warned that China has 50 coal-to-gas projects in the pipeline, which would produce an estimated 1.1 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year, an amount equal to about 1/8th of China's current CO2 emissions. ""We found that the Pension Fund has investments of NOK 4.6 billion (€ 544 million) in the companies behind these projects. The lifecycle carbon emissions of coal-gasification are much higher than simply burning the coal. These investments have to go,"" says Gulowsen. ""Coal is always controversial,"" says Arild Hermstad of the Future in our Hands, ""but we found many extremely dirty investments that stand out even in an already bad sector. NBIM doesn't seem to be discriminating against companies with bad mining practices, immense social impacts or routine violations of environmental laws."" One of the best examples is the GPF's recent investment of over NOK 107 million (€ 13 million) in Coal India Limited, the world's largest coal producer. ""I was shocked to see that the Norwegian Government Pension Fund purchased shares just last year,"" says Ashish Fernandes of Greenpeace India. ""This is irreconcilable with the Pension Fund's ethical guidelines."" According to Fernandes, the company has been charged with violating environmental laws, and is responsible for the forced displacement of indigenous forest dwellers as well as the destruction of key habitat for the Bengal tiger and Asian elephant. ""This company's entire business model is based on destroying forests, irrespective of the communities and biodiversity that depend on them,"" he adds. ""Dirty & Dangerous"" is the most comprehensive independent study that has ever been done on the Pension Fund's coal investments. It not only looks into the GPF's 2013 portfolio, but also examines the holdings in 2011 and 2012. The report challenges NBIM's claim that the Pension Fund's coal investments have been halved over the past 2 years. The report finds that the GPF's coal investments have increased by 13% since 2011. ""The increase is especially pronounced for coal-based utilities,"" says Heffa Schuecking and criticizes that NBIM does not seem to be monitoring or reporting these as coal investments. ""This seems absurd in view of the fact that coal-fired power plants are the biggest source of man-made CO2 emissions. It is time to move out of investments that will become tomorrow's emissions."" Just last week KLP, a Norwegian mutual insurance company managing assets of NOK 470 billion (€ 56 billion), announced its divestment from major coal- based utilities and mining companies. Norway's Storebrand, a pension fund managing assets of NOK 502 billion (€ 59 billion) had already begun divesting from major coal companies last year.  ""Now that Norway's two biggest private pension funds have moved away from coal, it is really time for the Government Pension Fund to follow suit,"" says Truls Gulowsen. ""The GPF is among the top ten investors in the global coal industry,"" says Arild Hermstad. ""It is time to change course and do what is right, both for future Norwegian generations as well as for the world."" ""Dirty & Dangerous"" makes concrete and workable suggestions for a meaningful divestment from coal for the GPF as well as other investors. The report was published by the German NGO Urgewald, Greenpeace Norway and the Future in our Hands. The report itself as well as the research data it is based on can be downloaded from www.urgewald.org "

Nijmegen ",'Record year' for bank coal financing as latest UN climate warning looms,Agricultural Bank of  ,China,,,,"
Ninety-two leading banks last year provided at least EUR 66 billion in financing to the coal industry, according to new coal financing data released today in BankTrack's ‘Banking on coal 2014' report.  This, believes the global campaigning network, represents a highly regrettable ‘record year' for financial support extended to the top 65 coal companies in both the coal mining and power sectors.
Released just days ahead of the publication of the fifth United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report, the EUR 66 billion figure represents a more than fourfold rise in climate-busting coal financing when compared to 2005, according to BankTrack's research.
Analysing what is now one of the primary forms of life support for a global coal industry in crisis, the new report also reveals that leading banks have provided 373 billion euros (500 billion dollars) in financing for the coal industry between 2005 and April 2014. The top 20 financiers, including JPMorgan Chase, Citi and RBS in the top three, have alone provided 73% of this amount. 
The new BankTrack research accompanies the launch of the ‘Banks: Quit Coal' campaign that aims to pressure commercial banks to cut their ties with the coal industry and instead divert capital to clean energy and energy efficiency. A new ‘Coal banks' website, also launched today, provides extensive data about the banking industry's ongoing deep links with the coal industry, and gives people around the world an opportunity to directly encourage banks to finally end their coal financing. 
Yann Louvel, BankTrack's Climate and Energy Campaign coordinator, said:
""The new BankTrack data issues a timely warning to the public and global decision-makers alike that rising coal financing, via banking giants like JPMorgan Chase, Citi and RBS as well as an increasing number of Chinese banks, continues to provide a vital lifeline to the increasingly beleaguered coal industry, while at the same time placing the planet in climate jeopardy.
""This is the most extensive data ever compiled on commercial bank financing of both coal mining and coal power, and even though we're probably only covering little more than half of the global banking sector's true financial support for the sector, the conclusion is stark: the lending figures have been rising steadily since 2005, and last year was a record year.""
Alex Scrivener, policy officer at the World Development Movement, said:
""At precisely the time we need to be rapidly pulling back from coal in order to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, banks all over the world are fuelling a whole new round of more coal mines and more coal-fired power plants. Any notion of ‘ethical banking' is incompatible with financing an energy source like coal. It's not only a disaster for the climate, it's also responsible for all manner of injustice inflicted on communities in the global south who have been devastated by the impacts of coal mining.""
Lucie Pinson, private finance campaigner for Les Amis de la Terre/Friends of the Earth France, added:
""These new ‘coal bank' findings will also help galvanise the growing public enthusiasm for divesting from coal and other fossil fuels by exposing the huge disconnect between banks' hype about their clean energy investments and aspirations, and their huge, still growing and much less talked-about support for dirty coal.
""It's all well and good to be trumpeting the odd wind and solar investment here and there, as the banks do every year in their sustainability reports. But our new data shows how wedded the majority of the banking sector still is to polluting, climate-changing and outmoded coal - the very stuff that they refuse to publicise."" 
Heffa Schücking, director of German environment group and BankTrack member urgewald, commented:
""The evidence presented in the new BankTrack report is shocking when you consider not only that the IPCC is just about to publish its most robust scientific findings yet about the extent of man-made climate change and the widespread damaging impacts being visited on human and natural systems alike. But also that many of the biggest public banks, including the World Bank, have taken the welcome first step of largely pulling out of financing for new coal power projects. The onus is now very much on the private banks to follow suit, and quit coal for good.""

4. From ‘Banking on coal 2014' - how ‘coal bank' financing compares with bank ‘green' talk:
BankTrack's number 1 ‘coal bank' JPMorgan Chase claims it is: ""Transitioning to a low carbon economy.""
The number 2 ‘coal bank' Citi insists that: ""We have made tremendous progress in reducing our environmental footprint.""
The number 3 ‘coal bank' RBS believes it is: ""Delivering a low carbon economy.""
The number 5 ‘coal bank' China Construction Bank is confident it is: ""A low-carbon, environmentally friendly bank.""
The number 6 ‘coal bank' Bank of America acknowledges the climate change reality and its own responsibilities: ""We agree that climate change is happening, society needs to transition from high-carbon to low-carbon energy, and the bank has a responsibility to accelerate this transition.""

San Francisco ",RAN Applauds Move by U.S. Banks to Reject Australian Coal Port,Citi ,United States,Carmichael coal mine project ,mining - coal  | transport and infrastructure,Australia,"
Rainforest Action Network commended the move by leading U.S. investment banks to rule out financing the Abbot Point coal export project in Queensland, Australia. Under pressure from RAN, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan Chase all issued written commitments-released publicly for the first time today-to not bankroll the controversial project, which would involve dredging part of the Great Barrier Reef.
""We're pleased to see some of the biggest banks on Wall Street reject this destructive project that presents a grave threat to the Great Barrier Reef and to the global climate,"" said RAN Climate and Energy Program Director Amanda Starbuck. ""These banks have clearly taken a good look at the Abbot Point plan and decided that dredging a World Heritage Site to make way for coal ships is obviously a terrible idea.""
The chilly reception to Abbot Point from U.S. banks follows five major European banks (Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Barclays, and Credit Agricole) publicly ruling out investment in Abbot Point earlier this year after months of campaigning from an international coalition. BlackRock has also warned investors to steer clear of the project. This new move by major U.S. banks signals that the Adani Group and GVK may be unsuccessful in their bid to secure an estimated $26.5 billion in external financing necessary for the planned expansion of coal export facilities and associated mine and rail infrastructure.
Rainforest Action Network is campaigning to stop Abbot Point due to concerns over how terminal construction and operation would impact the Great Barrier Reef; building the terminal would require dredging an ecologically sensitive area of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. Additionally, if Abbot Point moves forward it could unlock one of the world's largest untapped stores of carbon, the Galilee Basin, by providing critical export infrastructure. Nine new mega coal mines are currently planned for the Galilee Basin, five of which would be bigger than any coal mine currently operating in Australia. Galilee basin mines, if fully developed, would produce up to 330 million metric tons of coal per year for export, more than doubling Australia's exports. Australia is already the number two exporter of coal in the world.
""Stopping Abbot Point is a top priority for us, because this single project is the key to whether one of the largest stores of carbon on the planet, the Galilee Basin, stays in the ground where it belongs, or is sold on the global market and released into our atmosphere,"" said Starbuck. "

Melboune ",Hundreds publicly close bank accounts over fossil fuel investments,ANZ ,Australia,,,,"
Hundreds of Australians turned out at bank branches across the country on Saturday to publicly close their accounts in protest over their banks financing of fossil fuels. Several hundred people in Melbourne and Sydney, plus hundreds more across fifteen locations around Australia and online took part in a national day of divestment action, organised by environmental advocacy groups Market Forces and 350.org.High resolution images from divestment day activities are available at: http://bit.ly/divestmentdaypicsSince 2008 the ""Big Four"" banks have loaned almost $20 billion to fossil fuel projects, including many in sensitive areas such as the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. Concerned about the environmental and climate impacts of these projects, bank customers have been warning that unless loans to fossil fuels stop, they will take their money elsewhere. Today, hundreds of customers are making good on that commitment.The event comes amidst a high profile public debate over moves by the Australian National University to divest from two fossil fuel companies as part of a review of its socially responsible investment policy. The move has sparked criticism from several senior cabinet ministers including Joe Hockey, Christopher Pyne and Prime Minister Tony Abbott.""Faced with a government unwilling to take climate change seriously, Australians are taking matters into their own hands. Switching banks is a great way for Australians to align their money with their values. More importantly, it sends a powerful message to the big banks, that if they keep choosing fossil fuels, their customers will choose another bank,"" said Julien Vincent, Lead Campaigner for Market Forces.""Australia is on the verge of a massive fossil fuel expansion that would turn the Great Barrier Reef into a coal and gas shipping superhighway, and destroy our chances of a safe climate future. That's only going to happen if the big banks fund it, so with this action we want the banks to know their reputation is on the line as well as the environment,"" said Mr Vincent.Said Charlotte Wood, 350.org Australia Campaigns Director: ""By bringing into sharp relief the strong ties between the fossil fuel industry and our political leaders, divestment offers a powerful tool to begin to break the climate action deadlock.""Since the start of the campaign in 2013, the Big Four banks have lost an estimated $400 million worth of business from customers joining the fossil fuel divestment movement. The campaign has won high profile support from celebrities including singer-songwriter Missy Higgins who last week posted a Facebook message, announcing her intention to leave ANZ if they don't stop financing fossil fuels and Felix Riebl, lead singer of the Cat Empire who closed his ANZ accounts during the last divestment day.In recent months, the Australian fossil fuel divestment campaign has rapidly gained traction, with the past fortnight seeing divestment commitments from institutions including Local Government Super, the Perth and Canberra Anglican Dioceses, the Australian National University, Moreland City Council and Anglican National Super - the super provider for the Australian Anglican community.Said Brisbane resident Chris Grogan who today closed his ANZ account and moved $250,000 to another bank: ""I'm horrified to know that my bank is the biggest lender to coal and gas projects in Australia. If it wants to finance such massive harm to the environment and climate, it will have to do it without my money.""The action took place a day after 30 'Climate Warriors' from the Pacific Islands joined 300 Australians to blockade the world's largest coal port in Newcastle, drawing attention to the impacts of fossil fuel driven climate change on their countries.High resolution images from divestment day activities are available at: http://bit.ly/divestmentdaypics "

Beijing / Hong Kong ","Deutsche Bank under pressure as Chinese Government joins Greenpeace, condemning bungled IPO",Deutsche Bank ,Germany,,,,"
The Chinese
government has criticized as ""misleading"" a bungled initial public offering (IPO)
that Deutsche Bank organised for one of China's largest tuna longline companies.
The IPO has been suspended after Greenpeace exposed serious material omissions in China Tuna Industry Group's (CTI)
preliminary prospectus to
raise US$150 million, which was to be used to expand its fishing of vulnerable tuna
species in the Pacific Ocean.
Greenpeace has written to Deutsche Bank , seeking
clarification about its relationship with CTI, how it allowed the deal to go
ahead in the first place, and asking the bank to withdraw from the IPO.
""Overfishing is business
suicide for fishing companies, and a risk to investors. This scandal is a warning to financial
institutions like Deutsche Bank, and investors in the fishing sector not to
risk their reputations by dealing with companies that pillage our oceans. We
wait to hear how Deutsche Bank intends to fix its social and environmental risk
framework, a framework that should have prevented the IPO application from
happening in the first place,"" said Elsa Lee, Senior Business Advisor at Greenpeace East Asia.
CTI hoped to use the money from the share offering to expand its longline fleet targeting bigeye tuna in the Pacific
Ocean, but the IPO was
postponed after Greenpeace exposed significant investor risk to the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange. The draft prospectus
understated the supply risk to investors, citing an outdated stock assessment
for the now overfished bigeye tuna and revealing a business plan based on
ignoring catch limits and penalties set by regional fisheries management
organisations (RFMOs).
In a reply letter to Greenpeace, dated 30 September, China's Bureau of Fisheries confirmed it is
conducting an internal investigation into CTI. The Bureau of Fisheries stated that, ""The (draft) prospectus has gravely
misled investors and the international community, and caused a tremendous
negative impact."" Threatening further action, the Bureau states
""...the company's actions are already in violation of relevant laws and
regulations."" The Bureau has called on Dalian Ocean Fishing Company Ltd, the
fishing subsidiary of CTI, to halt any attempts to list its offshore fisheries
businesses, and to account to the Bureau on how it is handing the situation.
""Greenpeace welcomes this strong stand from the
Chinese government. It is now crucial that we prevent deals that fuel any increased
overfishing in distant waters from happening. As a first step, we urge the
financial sector, including Deutsche Bank, to remove itself from unsustainable
business such as CTI,"" said Lee.
Much of the global longline fleet operates out of control and out
of sight. Over 5000 vessels roam the oceans with little controls to ensure they
are fishing legally, sustainably, or ethically. There is huge bycatch of
endangered marine animals as well as serious overfishing, and depletion of
species such as yellowfin, albacore, bluefin, and bigeye - the species primarily
fished by CTI.

Nijmegen ",Investment warning regarding PT SIL,,,PT SIL ,agriculture - palm oil ,Indonesia,"

The following is an investor alert sent by BankTrack to financial institutions and investors on Friday 26th September 2014: 
Dear Sir / Madam
We are very concerned about the information we are receiving from indigenous
leaders from the Seluma district, in the Bengkulu province, Sumatra, Indonesia,
about the growing land conflict between their communities and the palm oil company
PT Sendabi Indah Lestari.  Two days ago,
the company forcefully displaced several families from their homes.  In protest, community  members seized some of the company's heavy equipment
and as the conflict escalated, the police arrived in heavy numbers.
PT SIL operates illegally as its HGU, the permit that allows it to
explore a concession, expired in 2012. The Land Authority Body did not renew the
HGU and therefore the company lost the legal basis to explore the land. The
principal permit that PT SIL holds does not give it the right to explore, and
certainly not to own the land, as is confirmed by the letter from the Governor
of Bengkulu Nr.700/II/BPP/2004 and Government's Regulation Nr 11, from 2010.
The communities hold land titles and are therefore the legal owners of the
land. 
PT SIL is  applying a series of
intimidation techniques to remove the indigenous communities from the land it has
grabbed. In the Seluma concession, it has already displaced more than 400
families and destroyed their houses, with the 
goal to eradicate the village of Minggir Sari. Backed by the police, it
dug a deep canal through the community's rice fields last year. This puts the
community's food security at risk, as the drained fields become unproductive. The
police has also repeatedly arrested community members with a variety of
charges, to intimidate them. This happened again on September 12th,
when two people were arrested while harvesting fresh fruit bunches on their own
land. They were released again, but have to report to the police twice a week,
which is a heavy burden for them, both economically and time wise.  
We are investigating which financial institutions and companies are
linked to PT SIL, but in the meantime, we urge you to check if your bank or
company has any financial or commercial relations with PT SIL or its mother
company, the Indonesia shipping company  PT. Gurita Lintas Samudera.
If you do, we ask you to urgently use your influence with the company to
halt the conflict.
Yours sincerely,

Washington, D.C. ",Ban Ki-moon urged to champion public funds for climate finance,,,,,,"
Ahead of next week's U.N. General Assembly and Climate Summit, 118 groups from 37 countries urged U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to ensure that private finance is not counted as international climate finance, as well as ensure that the green bond market is truly green. The Secretary General, this week, named green bonds as one of a handful of areas in which the summit is expected to deliver major outcomes.
""Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's emphasis on private finance at his Climate Summit is in danger of allowing rich countries to shirk their moral and legal responsibilities to provide public climate finance,"" said Karen Orenstein of Friends of the Earth U.S. ""Many climate priorities of developing countries are not suitable for private investment. Public funds -- on a very large scale -- are essential if we are to avoid climate catastrophe for the world's poor."" 
International climate finance is the provision of funds by developed countries to help developing nations adapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and embark on environmentally-sound development pathways. The groups also warned against the risk of greenwashing with private investment, particularly in the green bond market, which has grown exponentially.
""Green bonds can be key to shifting investment dollars away from climate pollution and toward environmentally sound initiatives, but we must make sure they do not fund dirty, destructive projects,"" said Zachary Hurwitz of International Rivers. ""This means that green bonds must stay well clear of fossil fuels, nuclear power, destructive dams, waste incineration projects and harmful biomass or forestry deals.""
""The market for green bonds is still in its infancy, yet we are already seeing green-labelled bonds linked to destructive dams. Even the coal industry is asking at its next Coaltrans World Coal Conference whether green bonds can be a ‘new frontier for the industry,'"" said Ryan Brightwell of BankTrack. ""Clearly the answer is no; we have to shut down coal, not extend its life.""
""For this market to have credibility as a means of tackling climate change, issuers need to adhere to clear and science-based criteria on what can be considered ‘green' - with full consideration of the environmental and social impacts of what's being financed and transparent, public reporting throughout the lifetime of the bond,"" continued Brightwell.
Sean Kidney, CEO of the Climate Bonds Initiative, said, ""The very real threat of catastrophic climate change is the most serious environmental challenge the world faces. We need a climate science-grounded approach to what can and should be included in the green bonds market. With a clear and easy to use framework, the green bonds market could make a huge contribution to financing our rapid transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient future.""
Friends of the Earth U.S., International Rivers and BankTrack also released a briefing on green bonds.

Washington DC ",Report Warns Investors: Avoid Dominion’s Cove Point LNG Export Project,,,Dominion Cove Point LNG ,energy distribution,United States,"
A report released today warns investors of serious financial, corporate 
governance, and sustainability risks associated with Dominion Resources' new gas 
export subsidiary, Dominion Midstream, which would own a controversial $3.8 
billion liquefied natural gas export facility at Cove Point in southern 
Maryland. The report, prepared by the financial research 
firm Profundo, recommends that investors avoid buying units in Dominion 
Midstream (DM.). The company is currently awaiting approval from the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission to make an initial public offering (IPO) on 
the New York Stock Exchange.
""Investors 
buying the common units of Dominion Midstream Partners (DM.) should realize that 
this company's cash-flow is purely dependent on the Cove Point Liquefaction 
Project, for which further delays are expected,"" said Jan Willem van Gelder, 
director of Profundo, the research firm that prepared the investor risk report. 
""In combination with the limited voting power of the unitholders and the 
dominant position of parent company Dominion Resources, investors are likely to 
face very uncertain returns.""
Key 
performance risks highlighted in the report include:

Sustainability: The Cove Point 
project has already faced significant public protests and is likely to face 
mounting legal challenges because it threatens to cause significant air and 
water pollution, including impacts to the sensitive ecology of the Chesapeake 
Bay, to trigger more climate pollution than all seven of Maryland's existing 
coal-fired power plants combined, and to drive the expansion of environmentally 
damaging fracking. 
Market 
volatility: The volatile and 
unpredictable prices of natural gas overseas could make export projects from the 
United States unprofitable, thus rendering Dominion's Cove Point facility a 
stranded asset. 
Financial:  Dominion 
Midstream's undiversified cash flow and sole reliance on two customers increases 
the risks to investors from likely legal challenges or other delays, which could 
cause cost overruns or lead to missed contract deadlines for exporting gas 
overseas. 
Governance:  Dominion 
Midstream unitholders would be last in line to receive cash distributions from 
the project. Meanwhile, no agreement requires parent company Dominion Resources 
to pursue a business strategy favoring Dominion Midstream, and the underwriters 
of the IPO are also investors in the parent company-constituting clear conflicts 
of interest. 

""Dominion 
Midstream is concentrating significant financial risk on the success of Cove 
Point. The project faces continued delays in a business environment in which 
carbon pollution regulations are becoming stricter and the feasibility of the 
tax-free, master limited partnership structure is uncertain,"" said Matt Patsky, 
CEO of Trillium Asset Management. ""Long-term, I believe that investment in 
renewable energy infrastructure is a much smarter decision.""
Dominion 
Midstream filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 
in March 2014 to proceed with an IPO estimated to be worth approximately $400 
million. In May, a Dominion shareholder and the Chesapeake Climate Action 
Network filed an official complaint with the SEC over 
Dominion's failure to adequately disclose significant risks associated with the 
project.
""The 
Cove Point facility is already behind its original schedule. Even if Dominion 
receives the regulatory approvals it needs to begin construction, public 
interest groups are preparing for significant legal challenges that could cause 
further delay,"" said Diana Dascalu-Joffe, senior general counsel at the 
Chesapeake Climate Action Network. ""The project depends on an environmentally 
toxic and economically volatile fracking bubble, is vulnerable to the same 
climate change impacts it would worsen, and could be subject to increasingly 
costly regulations because of its large pollution footprint. This report warns 
investors of the full array of financial and reputational risks that come with 
Dominion's massive fossil fuel bet.""
The 
$3.8 billion Cove Point gas export terminal, proposed on the Chesapeake Bay in 
southern Maryland, continues to face steep public opposition and protests 
because of its potential role in speeding hydraulic fracturing, or ""fracking."" 
The proposal would also create global warming pollution on par with coal, and 
expose hundreds of nearby residents to potential explosion, flammable vapor 
cloud, and other liquefied gas catastrophes. Dominion is awaiting permit 
approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which received an 
unprecedented number of public comments-more than 150,000-gathered by dozens of 
community, state and national groups that oppose the project.
The 
Profundo risk report was commissioned by the Chesapeake Climate Action 
Network.

Jakarta ",Bumi’s Deadly Coal, Development Bank ,China,Kaltim Prima Coal mine ,mining - coal ,Indonesia,"
Indonesia’s largest coal mine, PT Kaltim
 Prima Coal (KPC), owned by PT Bumi Resources and TATA India, has been 
associated with human rights abuses and massive environmental 
contamination, according to a new report released today by JATAM, 
Indonesia’s Mining Advocacy Network.   The report exposes the massive environmental and social liabilities 
incurred by Bumi’s biggest asset, the KPC coal mine, just as the company
 goes into selective default as a result of failure to make scheduled 
payments to its bondholders . The embattled company now faces a dual 
threat of unpaid social and environmental liabilities coupled with a 
major default as a result of outstanding debts to its creditors, which 
include Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, the China Development Bank and 
China Investment Corporation.   “The KPC coal mine is contaminating several major rivers in East 
Kalimantan and destroying the livelihoods of thousands of indigenous 
Dayak peoples. People have been provided with no compensation from the 
government or the company. They now face increased flooding, have lost 
land and other resources, and are forced to buy water. In East 
Kalimantan, coal is not only a dirty form of energy that damages our 
climate, but it is also deadly, killing people and biodiversity,” said 
Merah Johansyah of JATAM East Kalimantan, one of the report’s authors.   The KPC mine is located in the Indonesian province of East Kalimantan 
and produces 50 million tonnes of coal per annum, making it one of the 
world’s largest coal mines. JATAM conducted a field visit to KPC’s 
project sites in June 2014, visiting three affected villages and the 
Sangatta township.   The report documents the following impacts:

Wastewater from KPC’s mines is 
frequently discharged untreated into the Sangatta and Bengalon Rivers, 
contaminating river water that is used by villages downstream and 
killing fish and other aquatic organisms.
Studies have shown that the Sangatta 
River is especially contaminated with heavy metals, with lead 
concentration reaching 18 times the regulated level, making it unsafe to
 consume or use. Communities now have to buy water for their daily 
needs.
The mine has caused frequent flooding 
downstream, affecting at least three villages and a main road in the 
region. Villagers have received no aid or compensation from the 
government or KPC.
Villagers report serious dust and noise 
disruptions from blasting, which occurs frequently without any prior 
announcement. The blasting has shattered window panes and caused cracks 
in buildings. Children wake up crying in shock and fear from nighttime 
blasting.
Indigenous Basap Dayak villagers from 
Keraitan village have already been moved from their ancestral homelands 
and are now facing another relocation. KPC has been intimidating people 
to force them to move, and the local municipality has stopped providing 
health workers or teachers to the village. Villagers from Keraitan and 
other relocation sites report having insufficient land to cultivate or 
hunt. 

Share prices of Bumi Resources, the 
financially troubled holding company of KPC, have plummeted 71% over the
 past year. Swiss bank Credit Suisse, along with China Investment 
Corporation and the China Development Bank, have been heavily involved 
in bankrolling the corporation. JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank have 
also acted as underwriters for Bumi Resources, despite the company’s 
poor financial performance. The company is frantically trying to 
renegotiate bond repayments with investors, and has negotiated a 
complicated debt-equity swap with the Chinese sovereign wealth fund CIC 
to avoid defaulting on its debt.  “We call on all banks, financiers and shareholders of Bumi Resources to 
use their influence with this company and their subsidiaries to bring an
 end to the problems of KPC. If this does not happen immediately, they 
should cancel their loans and commit to issue no more loans or purchase 
no more shares or bonds in Bumi Resources or any company associated with
 it and take steps toward public divestment from these companies,” said 
Arif Fiyanto, Climate and Energy Campaigner with Greenpeace Southeast 
Asia.  The report may be downloaded at english.jatam.org.  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-11/bumi-makes-second-attempt-to-avert-375-million-bond-default.html "

Edinburgh ","New report calls for smaller, greener banking in post-referendum Scotland",Lloyds Banking Group ,United Kingdom,Cerrejón coal mine ,mining - coal ,Colombia,"
A report released today by Friends of the Earth Scotland calls on the Scottish Government to break up our two dominant banks and reform the banking system so that it better meets the needs of society with a particular focus on supporting environmentally sustainable activities.Post-referendum discussions could provide the Scottish Government with the powers to reform the financial system north of the border.The report by financial journalist and author Ray Perman makes the following seven recommendations:On the dominance of big banks:

Whatever the outcome of the referendum on independence the Scottish Government should present as strong a case as possible for breaking up the two dominant banks to form a more diversified and competitive market in Scotland.
Banks should be encouraged to devolve more decision-making to local managers and to adopt governance models which promote local accountability.


On the continued financing of fossil fuels:
 

The Scottish Government should consider contributing to the Green Investment Bank to counter the fall in investment in renewables, with a particular focus on increasing finance for community renewable projects and the development of wind, tidal and wave technology.
To respond to concerns about the ""carbon bubble"" the Scottish Government should re-examine its policy on the extraction of fossil fuels including North Sea oil and gas.
All banks and investment management companies operating in Scotland should be required to publish the carbon intensity of their loanbooks and equity portfolios to enable them to reduce the carbon intensity of their investments in line with existing legislation to cut carbon emissions.


On creating a financial sector of small, accountable banks in a post-referendum Scotland:
 

In an independent Scotland the Scottish Government should influence banking competition to encourage new entrants to create a more diverse banking sector which takes more notice of community needs and builds environmental sustainability into its lending criteria.
If there is a No vote in the referendum in September 2014 the Scottish Government should lobby in London and Brussels for regulatory frameworks which favour non-traditional business models including credit unions, regional, local, cooperative and municipal banks.


The report's author Ray Perman said, ""whatever happens on 18th September, the Government needs to act to create a competitive, diverse banking market in Scotland. Government should break up RBS and Bank of Scotland to develop smaller banks that are more accountable to local communities and which make sure their investments improve the world instead of financing environmental destruction.""He continued, ""our current banking market does not serve the needs of people or the planet. Banks should publish the full carbon footprint of their loans and adopt governance models which promote local accountability.""The five largest banks - Lloyds, Barclays, RBS, HSBC and Santander - have between them 73% of the UK market. But in Scotland the position is much worse. Just two banks - Lloyds (owner of Bank of Scotland) and RBS - hold 70% of the small business banking and personal banking markets. ""This concentration is anti-competitive and works against the interest of consumers and the economy. It should be rectified by forcing the banks to sell or spin-off branches and head office operations to form new challenger banks.""The Competition and Markets Authority is to launch a full inquiry into UK retail banking. The Scottish Government should use this opportunity to present as strong a case as possible for breaking up the two dominant banks to form a more diversified and competitive market in Scotland.""RBS is 81% owned by the UK taxpayer having been bailed out by the UK Government in 2008.Ric Lander, Friends of the Earth Scotland's Sustainable Finance Campaigner said, ""these taxpayer-owned banks cannot continue their environmentally and socially destructive lending practices. Scotland's world leading climate targets are eclipsed by the loans and investments made by banks such as RBS . The Government needs to act to break up these self-serving banks.""He continued, ""citizens should be appalled that publicly owned banks are continuing to invest billions in destructive industries such as coal mining companies operating in Africa, Asia and Latin America . The Government must stop banks investing our money in fossil fuels projects which will ultimately be left stranded by our need to tackle climate change.""ENDSNotes to Editors1. The report will be launched at 6pm tonight at the Scottish Parliament with Ray Perman, Patrick Harvie MSP and Gemma Bone. The author will introduce the report and a panel will discuss its implications for banking reform in Scotland. Full event details.The full report is available here.2. Together Bank of Scotland and RBS control 70% of the small business banking market in Scotland.3.The carbon footprint of RBS' loans are 18 times the entire carbon footprint of Scotland.4.

","New investigation finds ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ policy leads to IFC blunders in Honduras human rights scandal",,,Bajo Aguan Valley Palm Oil Plantation ,agriculture - palm oil ,Honduras,"
An internal investigation released last night finds that
 World Bank Group staff kept quiet about a plantation company’s role in a
 violent land conflict in Honduras, when proposing loans to
 one of Central America’s top ten banks which funded it.   The
 investigation by the World Bank Group’s Office of the Compliance 
Advisor/Ombudsman (CAO) focused on a series of equity investments and 
loans made by the bank’s private-sector lending arm, the International
 Finance Corporation (IFC), in Banco Ficohsa, the third largest bank in 
Honduras. The report includes a number of highly critical findings, 
including that IFC: 

 Acquired
 an equity stake in a commercial bank with significant exposure to high 
risk sectors and clients, but which lacked capacity to implement IFC’s 
environmental and social requirements; 
 Concealed
 serious allegations from IFC’s project documents about Ficohsa’s third 
largest customer, Corporación Dinant, including its alleged involvement 
in forced evictions, killings and disappearances. Rather,
 CAO notes the characterization of Dinant’s owner as a “very respected 
businessman….”, of Dinant as a “top player” and “regional leader” with 
“high development impact”; 
 Environmental
 and Social staff “did not ask about Ficohsa’s exposure to high risk 
sub-clients , and their regionally-based investment 
colleagues, who were aware of the issues, did not tell.” 
 Breached
 its own Environmental and Social requirements meant to protect local 
communities from harm by failing properly to assess risk and to 
supervise compliance with its policies. 

Fully
 62 per cent of IFC funding is now channelled through third parties like
 Banco Ficohsa. This form of lending through financial intermediaries, 
such as commercial banks, private equity funds and hedge funds,
 heightens the risk of things going wrong – according to an earlier 
investigation by the CAO.  The
 CAO investigation took aim once again at the IFC’s approach to 
investing in financial intermediaries, as it did in a 2012 review of its
 financial sector portfolio, stating that IFC “has, through its banking
 investments, an unanalyzed and unquantified exposure to projects with 
potential significant adverse environmental and social impacts.”   The
 CAO concludes: “Absent disclosure of information related to these 
projects, this exposure is also effectively secret and thus divorced 
from systems which are designed to ensure that IFC, and its clients are
 accountable to project affected people for delivery on their 
environmental and social commitments.”   International
 and Honduran civil society groups – including La Plataforma Agraria de 
Honduras, Movimiento Madre Tierra (Honduras), SOMO (Netherlands), 
Urgewald (Germany), Bank Information Center, Oxfam, Bretton
 Woods Project, Global Witness, Inclusive Development International and 
the Center for International Environmental Law - today call on World 
Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim to clean up these scandals and learn 
the right lessons from this case and the earlier
 Dinant audit by proposing an action plan to change the culture behind it.     The
 World Bank Group should immediately require Corporación Dinant to halt 
all violence directed at local farmers and find a peaceful and 
sustainable resolution to the conflict over land. An impartial 
investigation
 of crimes committed against smallholder farmers in the Aguán region, 
given the high level of impunity in Honduras, should be undertaken. The 
IFC should also end all loans to Dinant if ongoing investigations find 
Dinant to be responsible for any of these.  President
 Kim should ask the CEO of the IFC, Jin Yong Cai to start a root and 
branch reform of the IFC’s institutional culture, which incentivises 
loan volume over quality –prompting staff to hide social and
 environmental risks – to ensure that staff take social and 
environmental standards seriously and give them the same importance as 
financial risks; and rethink the IFC’s approach to lending through 
financial intermediaries. The groups are now calling on the
 IFC to release an Action Plan, in time for the Annual Meetings of the 
World Bank Group this coming October, to address problems in IFC’s 
institutional culture which cause systemic failures in IFC’s 
investments.   The
 current investigation centres on the 2011 IFC $70 million investment in
 Honduras’ Banco Ficohsa – whose third largest client was palm oil and 
food company Corporación Dinant. An earlier CAO investigation into a $30 million loan the IFC made 
directly to Dinant in 2009 cited allegations that 102 members of famers’
 associations in the Aguán Valley have been murdered in the last four 
years, 40 of these associated with Dinant property
 or its security guards. The CAO noted Dinant’s position that the 
killings were either unconnected to Dinant and its security personnel, 
or involved acts of legitimate self-defence on behalf its security 
personnel. The expansion of palm oil plantations in the
 Aguán Valley has long been associated with extensive abuses, including 
the killing, kidnapping and forced eviction of farmers.   Juan Almendarez, Director of Friends of the Earth Honduras (Movimiento
 Madre Tierra) and member of the Plataforma Agraria said: “There are 
independent reports on the involvement of Dinant in human rights 
violations against small farmers in the Aguán region,
 and yet international financing continues to flow before the 
investigation is completed into the murder of these farmers in the 
context of the agrarian conflict. It is simply wrong for the World Bank 
Group to continue providing loans to corporations that violate
 the human rights of farmers and their families with total impunity.”   Miriam Miranda, Coordinator of the Black Fraternal Organization of Honduras (OFRANEH),
 said: “The CAO report citing involvement of Dinant security
 guards in serious human rights violations against smallholder farmers 
in the Aguán region should compel the World Bank Group to change  course.
 We call on all multilateral financial institutions to stop providing 
millions of dollars in loans to corporations that have been accused 
nationally and internationally of responsibility for serious human
 rights violations as is the case even indirectly with IFC support to 
Ficosha.”    Knud Voecking of German NGO Urgewald said:
 “It is a double scandal that the IFC was already aware of serious 
allegations surrounding Corporación Dinant when it made its first 
investment in 2009, yet went ahead with further financing in
 2011, 2013 and 2014 through Ficohsa. This is adding insult to injury.”   IFC response inadequate    In 
its response to the CAO investigation, the IFC pointed to actions it was
 already taking as a result of the CAO’s January 2014 audit of its 
Dinant investment; and to its September 2013 Action Plan on financial
 intermediary (FI) lending which, while resulting in some improvements, 
still fails to address fundamental problems with risk categorisation, 
supervision, disclosure and verification.   Local
 groups claim that the situation in the Aguán Valley continues to be 
violent and tense, despite the IFC’s commitments to address the violence
 in its Action Plan.
Glenda Chávez, of the Gregorio Chávez Peasant Movement and member
 of the International Human Rights Monitoring Group of Aguán said ""Three
 hundred families who had resettled in the Paso Aguán area were 
violently evicted on July 3rd by the police as part
 of its operation Xatruch in Dinant’s plantations, which injured several
 people and left two seriously wounded by gunfire. I was arrested, along
 with Idalia Perdono Díaz and five other community members simply for 
carrying out our work as human rights defenders.""   Carla Garcia Zendejas, program director at the Washington-based Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL)
 said: “Farming communities and local activists are willing to put their
 lives in jeopardy to defend their rights to land, housing and property,
 to protect their families and livelihoods. The
 violent clashes stemming from FICOHSA's investment in the Aguán Valley 
have reached deadly proportions precisely because communities know the 
future of the region is at stake.”   David Pred, Managing Director of Inclusive Development International (IDI)
 asked: “How many more scandalous Dinant-like investments is IFC 
covering up in its financial sector portfolio? It is time for IFC to end
 the secrecy of well over half of its investments that
 are channelled through financial intermediaries like Ficohsa. The 
projects that are funded by IFC’s banking and private equity clients 
must be immediately disclosed so that the people affected by these 
investments can hold them to account for their social
 and environmental obligations.”   Jelson Garcia of the Bank Information Center said
 “One of this report's main findings is that there is a breakdown in the
 IFC's systems approach to FIs, especially in risk categorisation. This 
resonates with initial 2012 report of the CAO on
 FIs, and indeed links to recent cases in Myanmar and India as yet 
another example of the IFC needing to take stringent and urgent reforms 
of its financial markets lending approach.”   Notes to Editors  The CAO report is at: http://www.cao-ombudsman.org/cases/document-links/documents/CAOInvestigationofIFCRegardingFicohsa_C-I-R9-Y13-F190.pdf The IFC’s response is at: http://www.cao-ombudsman.org/cases/document-links/documents/IFCResponsetoCAOregardingFicohsa_July142014.pdf   This

",Artificial intelligence? Computers financing man’s destruction - On DBs investment in HAGL through its passive fund ETF Vietnam,Deutsche Bank ,Germany,,,,"
Robots are the Frankenstein’s monsters of the modern imagination. 
Popular culture is bursting with tales of man-made cyborgs that threaten
 human extinction and run roughshod over our planet.
This is the stuff of fantasy of course, but could our own cybernetic 
inventions really contribute to the demise of both people and planet?  
An emerging computer-led investment trend offers food for thought.
It’s a little known trend called passive investing, that is actually 
getting quite big. Passive investment undermines checks and balances 
aimed at regulating the financial sector and preventing the financial 
backing of companies that plunder our natural resources or commit human 
rights abuses.
When you put your money in an investment fund, it will either be 
actively or passively managed. An active investment fund is run by a 
fund manager – a real person assessing companies and making investment 
decisions. Their aim is to make a return that is superior to the stock 
market that the companies sit within.
Passive investing bypasses the human element. Funds are run by a 
computer that tracks an index (typically a stock market or a sector), 
the advantage being that you don’t have to pay a suit a hefty fee to 
make decisions for you, and the speed and accuracy of decision-making 
means you’re far more likely to make a profit.
So what are the problems? In the absence of a person to make 
investment decisions there is no risk assessment of companies. Because 
stock exchanges don’t require companies to have social or environmental 
standards in order to publicly list, the chances of investing in a 
tainted company are far higher. And of course, with no active fund 
manager comes no accountability – banks can simply point at the 
computers and shrug their shoulders.
If the computer says yes, so does the bank, regardless of any investment policies that the bank may have.
With institutional Investors owning around 70 per cent of public 
companies, and passive investments accounting for around a third and 
growing of shareholdings, this is a problem which can’t be ignored.
Take the example of Deutsche Bank. Last year, Global Witness exposed the bank for investing in Vietnamese land-grabbing rubber giant Hoang Anh Gia 
Lai (HAGL). After six months of empty reform promises from HAGL, Global 
Witness advised investors to withdraw from the company, and was encouraged when Deutsche Bank did exactly that.
What Deutsche Bank didn’t tell us at the time, however, was that 
while one part of the bank was divesting from HAGL, another part was 
investing through a different fund. Between June and November 2013, 
Deutsche Bank London snapped up nearly seven million shares in HAGL 
through its Exchange Tracker Fund (ETF) Vietnam – a passive investment 
fund – taking Deutsche Bank’s total share in HAGL to just under five per
 cent.
In March this year, Global Witness also exposed how Dimensional Fund Advisors (DFA) – in which Arnold Schwarzenegger 
holds a near five percent stake – has been bankrolling particularly 
nasty logging companies, including one previously linked to arms 
trafficking during a brutal civil war in Liberia, part funded by illegal
 logging.  DFA’s clients are selected through ‘algorithmic trading’, 
that is, through a pre-programmed computer.
The Guardian recently reported on the same issue with regards to Soco International, a UK-listed 
company which plans to explore for oil in Virunga National Park, a world
 heritage site in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Many of Soco’s investors are passive investors who invest across the 
entire market. They own shares in Soco because it is part of the FTSE 
250 index, despite the fact that it could potentially cause irreversible
 damage to some of the world’s last remaining intact forest, also home 
to critically-endangered mountain gorillas.
The example of Soco also highlights the risks passive investing poses to climate change prevention. Financial specialists Carbon Tracker have assessed the amount of fossil fuel reserves owned by the top 100 
listed coal and top 100 listed oil and gas companies and estimated that 
only 20 per cent of their total reserves can be burned if we are to 
prevent catastrophic climate change, leaving up to 80 per cent of assets
 effectively unburnable.
Passive investment helps to maintain the status quo of a very risky, 
and essentially unsustainable, business. It sends entirely the wrong 
message, pouring money into a sector at odds with our collective 
survival.
There is already some evidence of banks raising the issue of 
high-risk companies on the stock market – Deutsche Bank raised its 
concerns around HAGL with FTSE  International , for example – which is 
encouraging, but safeguarding against the problems of passive investing 
will require stronger environmental, social and governance standards for
 companies to publicly list in the first place. Ensuring that regulators
 require greater disclosure on reserves and carbon emissions to assess 
this material risk to financial stability could also help.
At a time where there is increased pressure for companies to operate 
sustainably and growing realisation of the need for transparency and 
accountability within the banking sector, the impacts and apparent 
contradictions of such a way of investing require attention.
So let’s not be passive about passive investing – let’s rage against the machine. "

Nijmegen ",OECD releases letters clarifying banks’ human rights responsibilities,,,,,,"
At the OECD's Global Forum on Responsible
Business Conduct in Paris last month, the OECD published a series of letters clarifying banks' human rights responsibilities under the
UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The letters date from
November and December 2013, but have now been published for the first time.
The letters have far-reaching implications
for banks, which have in some cases sought to play down their responsibilities
for human rights abuses caused by companies or projects they help finance.
The UN Guiding Principles, unanimously
adopted by the UN Human Rights Council in 2011, and the OECD Guidelines on
Multinational Enterprises state that business enterprises must ""avoid causing or contributing to adverse human
rights impacts through their own activities, and address such impacts when they
occur"", and must ""seek to prevent or mitigate adverse human rights impacts that
are directly linked to their operations,
products or services by their business relationships, even if they have not
contributed to those impacts.""
However, a 2013
report into current approaches and practices to due diligence in the
financial sector found that ""FIs  view themselves to be
indirectly linked to an adverse human
rights impact through the financial services they provide to their clients"".  By arguing that they were  only ""indirectly linked"" to impacts they
finance, they were seeking to evade any responsibilities to avoid,  prevent, or mitigate such impacts.
No
such thing as indirect links to human
rights impacts
In one of the letters released by the OECD,
the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) makes clear
that the banks were mistaken in their interpretation, and that ""there is
either a (direct) link between the products, services or operations of a
business enterprise and an adverse impact through a business relationship, or
there is no link"". Further, the letter makes clear that such a direct link can
arise ""through  business relationships with investee
companies, project partners, clients and other entities."" 
This clearly establishes that banks do have
a responsibility under the OECD Guidelines and the UN Guiding Principles to try
to prevent or mitigate adverse human rights impacts caused by their client
companies.
Banks can also contribute to human rights impacts through their finance
It is clear
that banks can cause human rights
impacts through their own activities, for example through discriminating
against women or ethnic minorities in their hiring or mortgage provisions. But
the OHCHR letter also makes clear that banks can also contribute to adverse human rights impacts through their finance,
""such as if financing is provided for a project that will result in widespread
displacement of communities, without safeguards in place"".
UN conclusions strengthen the case for bank remediation
processes 
The
distinction between contributing to
human rights impacts and being directly
linked to them through a business relationship is important because it
determines what is expected of banks and other businesses according to the OECD
Guidelines and the Guiding Principles.
For
example, where banks contribute to adverse human rights impacts, the OECD
Guidelines and Guiding Principles state that they should ""provide for or
cooperate in their remediation through legitimate processes"". Where a bank has
not contributed to such impacts, ""the responsibility to respect human rights
does not require that the enterprise itself provide for remediation, though it
may take a role in doing so.""
Currently,
there is no sign of banks establishing processes to remedy human rights impacts
that they have contributed to. BankTrack is calling on banks to ensure
grievance mechanisms are established for projects which present human rights
risks, and to establish their own mechanisms that allow rights holders affected
by bank financed projects and activities access to remedy. BankTrack is also
collaborating with OECD Watch to explore
possibilities for using the OECD Guidelines' complaint procedure to incentivise
banks to establish such mechanisms. "

",Greenwash alert as palm oil companies sign onto continued deforestation,,,,,,"

Jakarta, 11 July 2014 – Major palm oil producers including Sime Darby, 
KLK and Asian Agri announced this week a ""sustainability initiative"" 
which Greenpeace warns will undermine consumer companies' recent 
commitments to remove deforestation from their palm oil supply chains.


The initiative, called the Sustainable Palm Oil Manifesto (SPOM), 
claims to go beyond sustainability standards established by the 
Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). But rather than stopping 
forest clearance, it will allow for continued deforestation while 
members of the Manifesto study tools to determine what forests to 
develop or protect, known as the High Carbon Stock (HCS) Approach.
Bustar Maitar, head of the Indonesia forest campaign at Greenpeace International, said:
""This is not the milestone Sime Darby is saying it is. Greenpeace 
does not support a process that allows companies to claim 'no 
deforestation' while their manifesto allows them to continue to clear 
forests.
""Indonesia's forests are disappearing faster than anywhere else in 
the world, and the level of action must match this urgency. Further 
research to strengthen the HCS Approach is welcome, but allowing 
clearance in the name of 'sustainability' is nothing less than 
greenwashing. To show they are serious about addressing deforestation, 
the group must immediately stop clearing potential HCS forests.""
""Our message to consumer companies such as Unilever, Nestle and 
P&G – which have promised consumers around the world clean, 
responsibly produced palm oil – is clear: do not be fooled by these 
half-baked commitments. We call on these consumer companies to use their
 power in the market to tell suppliers to stop the bulldozers and demand
 forest protection.""
On the High Carbon Stock (HCS) Approach:
Greenpeace, Golden Agri Resources and TFT developed the HCS Approach,
 which combines carbon and biodiversity conservation, as well as 
community rights and livelihoods to determine what land can and cannot 
be developed.
""Tools to implement No Deforestation are already being tested and 
starting to be implemented by the likes of Asia Pulp & Paper, Golden
 Agri Resources, Cargill and Wilmar. Companies serious about breaking 
their link with forest destruction will stop the bulldozers now, and 
work to strengthen this definition, rather than support a fringe 
initiative that has not gained credibility in the eyes of NGOs,"" said 
Bustar.
Other flaws in the Sustainable Palm Oil Manifesto are:

It does not clearly state that no deforestation and no development 
on peatland will take place across the supply chains of SPOM members. 
This is significantly weaker than Wilmar and GAR's existing No 
Deforestation policies.
The Manifesto does not clearly state that it will apply to all its 
signatories' operations regardless of the size of their stake. This is a
 crucial loophole and a significant reputational risk, as some of the 
signatories are engaged in joint ventures with parties that have been 
accused of deforestation.

Amsterdam, Brussels ",Friends of the Earth files OECD complaint against Rabobank finance for illegal palm oil,Rabobank ,Netherlands,Bumitama ,agriculture - palm oil ,Indonesia,"
Milieudefensie (Friends of the Earth Netherlands)
and Friends of the Earth Europe have filed a complaint with the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development against the Dutch Rabobank. The
complaint focuses on multiple loans from Rabobank to the Indonesian palm oil
company Bumitama. The company is accused of managing an illegal palm oil
plantation and of having caused deforestation, thereby not only violating the
sustainability policy of Rabobank but also the OECD Guidelines for Multinational
Enterprises. Rabobank has
provided around 47 million euros in loans to the company.
In the complaint, Milieudefensie and
Friends of the Earth Europe demand that Rabobank  terminates its relationship with Bumitama, or
freeze credit lines until the palm oil company has solved the problems
identified in the complaint.
The bank should demonstrate what steps it
has taken to ensure that Bumitama adheres to its own policies. In addition,
both organizations want more transparency from the bank.
Complaints
about Bumitama
Rabobank demands of its customers in the
palm oil sector membership of, and compliance with the Round Table for
Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). Bumitama is known as a company that has repeatedly
caused deforestation of protected nature reserves and has been marketing
illegally produced palm oil. Since July 2012, five complaints have been filed
with the RSPO against the company. The most recent complaint, about the illegal
plantation GMS which is managed by Bumitama, was submitted on April 29, 2014 by
Friends of Borneo. To date, none of the complaints has been brought to a
successful conclusion. Meanwhile, Bumitama has continued to manage the illegal palm
oil plantation.
Anne van Schaik of Friends of the Earth
Europe: ""Rabobank has shown itself pretty naïve on this issue. The bank
says it wants to continue pressuring Bumitama to make sustainable choices, but
whatever the bank says or does, illegal production of palm oil has continued
since 2011.""

Edinburgh ",RBS AGM: Protestors to target top coal bank,Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS)  ,United Kingdom,Cerrejón coal mine ,mining - coal ,Colombia,"
Protestors will target RBS at its AGM in Edinburgh on Wednesday, demanding that the bank pull its money out of coal. Protestors dressed as bankers will hand out lumps of coal disguised as luxury chocolates - fossil rochers - while others will hold placards reading ‘RBS out of coal'. RBS invests more in coal mining worldwide than any other UK bank, providing the industry with more than £4 billion since 2005. It ranks eighth of all banks globally for its financing of coal. Coal has a major impact on climate change, releasing more greenhouse gases per tonne than any other fuel. Coal also devastates local environments, destroying the lives of people living in areas where it is mined. The prospect of constitutional change following the Scottish independence referendum in September, whatever the outcome, has led to calls for reform of the banking sector in Scotland. Campaigners believe RBS ending its financing of coal would be a crucial part of this.World Development Movement Scotland campaigner Liz Murray said today: ""Coal is one of the most polluting of all fossil fuels, bad both for people and for the planet. It's a disgrace that RBS, which is largely owned by us, the taxpayers, still bankrolls this dirty, destructive industry. We need RBS to set a timeline for phasing out its fossil fuel investments, and to pull out of financing coal.""Richard Dixon, director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said today: ""Despite being owned by the people, investments in coal show RBS is not serving its public function. A truly sustainable banking sector can only work on smaller scales with more democratic control. Breaking up RBS could help us reach this goal."" RBS announced in April that it would end its financing of ‘mountaintop removal' coal mining, following opposition from people in the Appalachian region of the United States who have seen the tops of more than 500 mountains blasted off for coal. But the bank continues to finance coal mining companies operating worldwide, including in southern Africa, Colombia, Australia and central Europe. It has invested a total of £3.3 billion since 2009 in mining giants BHP Billiton, Anglo American and Glencore Xstrata, the companies behind the massive Cerrejón mine in Colombia. Cerrejón is the biggest coal mine in South America and is fiercely opposed by local people, including the indigenous Wayúu whose territory it has destroyed.

Edinburgh ",Royal Bank of Scotland Rules Out Financing Major Coal Port Expansion,Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS)  ,United Kingdom,Carmichael coal mine project ,mining - coal  | transport and infrastructure,Australia,"
In yet another sign of major international banks' growing unwillingness to fund coal terminal projects that threaten the iconic Great Barrier Reef, Royal Bank of Scotland last night joined Deutsche Bank and HSBC in publicly ruling out financing of the controversial Abbot Point coal terminal near Bowen, Queensland. The terminal will export coal from the nine mega coal mines planned for Queensland's Galilee Basin.

 

In a letter to campaign organisations the bank wrote: ""RBS is not involved in the Abbot Point expansion project and has no plans to be involved in the future."" The bank later tweeted the same statement to campaign organisation GetUp (image below).

 

RBS's move comes as UNESCO's World Heritage Committee meets in Doha to consider listing of the Reef as World Heritage in Danger. Despite this, and against mounting international community opposition and clear evidence of the destructive potential of the developments - including today's decision by UNESCO - the Australian and Queensland governments continue to press ahead with approvals of massive coal port expansions along the Reef.

 

Felicity Wishart, Great Barrier Reef campaigner for the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said: ""While the Australian and Queensland governments have approved millions of tonnes of destructive dredging and dumping at Abbot Point, it is heartening to see global financial institutions such as the RBS take leadership and reject investment in projects that will damage the Reef.""

 

""The health of the Great Barrier Reef is already suffering due to poor water quality. Port expansions would mean millions of tonnes of seabed being dredged and dumped in the Reef's waters - sediment would cloud the water, damaging seagrass and coral, making matters far worse.""

 

Ben Pearson of Greenpeace said: ""It is great to see that three global investment banks have now publically distanced themselves from this risky, irresponsible project. It will be interesting to see if other British banks follow their lead over the coming months - particularly in the light of the strong concern that UNESCO have expressed around the port projects.""

 

Maddy Carrol, Campaigns Director at 38 Degrees, said: ""There's no way they, or any UK bank for that matter, should be investing in such a morally wrong project - this isn't what we bailed them out for! 38 Degrees members care passionately about protecting the world we live in - especially against big business and corporate greed. RBS have judged this one the right way. This should send a clear signal to the rest of the world's banks, the Australian government and Adani that people just won't stand the pursuit of profits at all cost.""

 

Yann Louvel of BankTrack said,  ""We congratulate RBS on doing the right thing and ruling out investments in Abbot Point. These hugely expensive projects are rapidly running out of friends, before they even get going. We now encourage RBS to go a step further. In order to protect the health of the Reef, RBS must also rule out investments in planned coal mines in Queensland's Galilee Basin that are the driver for port developments that will ship millions of tonnes of coal through the Reef every year.""

 
RBS's statement was a response to a campaign by a coalition of Australian and international NGOs representing millions of supporters aimed at protecting the Great Barrier Reef and preventing the construction of massive new coal mines in Central Queensland. Partner organisations include: World Development Movement, 38 Degrees, Sum of Us, BankTrack, Greenpeace, GetUp!, Market Forces, Friends of the Earth Scotland, WWF, the Australian Marine Conservation Society, and350.org.

We are not involved in financing the expansion of Abbot Point & have no plans to be involved in the future.

Worldwide ",Network announces powerful new Global Paper Vision,,,,,,"
Today, an international network of more
than one hundred twenty organizations on six continents - including BankTrack - is unveiling a powerful new Global
Paper Vision that will unite the myriad of voices currently challenging the
paper industry to adopt more sustainable practices. This blueprint for change
addresses the priorities for social responsibility and environmental
conservation in response to global paper consumption patterns and the
industry's influence on biodiversity, forest health, global warming, air and water
quality, and local communities.
The new single Vision harmonizes several regional vision statements for industry
reform around the world into a more coordinated effort to match the globalized
supply chain for paper products and raw materials. The signatories of the Vision are known collectively for their
successful efforts moving the marketplace to more sustainable products, securing
improved forestry practices by the world's largest paper companies, and
accelerating the transformation of the entire industry over the past decade.
The
new Global Paper Vision identifies
seven common goals among the organizations that are key objectives for change:
reducing consumption; maximizing recycled content; ensuring social
responsibility; sourcing fiber responsibly; reducing greenhouse gas emissions;
ensuring clean production; and ensuring transparency.
""Paper use has
social, environmental, and human rights implications and this vision points at
ways to improve them all,"" said Saskia Ozinga of FERN, based in the United
Kingdom.
""Jikalahari realized
one of the underlying causes of deforestation in Indonesia comes from
activities of timber plantations to fulfill the demand of world's pulp and
paper, and that is why we need a Global Paper Vision,"" said Woro
Supartinah of Jikalahari in Indonesia.
""By following the
guidance of the Global Paper Vision, paper users can drive the market
toward better paper products, which helps to reduce global warming pollution,
save forests, conserve water and energy, and divert usable materials from
incinerators and landfills,"" stated Darby Hoover of the Natural Resources
Defense Council in the United States.
Collectively the signatories commit to developing
collaboration and dialogue between NGOs, industry and other institutions; encouraging
governments to develop legislative, fiscal and operational measures consistent
with the vision; encouraging only responsible investment in the industry; articulating
and implementing responsible procurement and purchasing guidance; monitoring
the progress of all stakeholders towards the Vision; and campaigning to end socially and environmentally
damaging activities by the pulp and paper industry.
The Environmental Paper Network will serve
as a hub to facilitate collaboration and dialogue, identify and implement collective
actions, host shared resources and monitor progress towards the Vision through publications such as the State of the Industry Report. 
To read the complete Global
Paper Vision and a list of signatories visit: www.environmentalpaper.org/Vision.
The Environmental Paper Network is an international
collaborative project of more than 120 organizations working for social and
environmental transformation in the production and consumption of pulp and
paper. Regional network leadership is provided by committees in North America
(environmentalpaper.org), Europe (environmentalpaper.eu) and China
(environmentalpaper.cn). "

Kiad, Panama /  Amsterdam, Netherlands ",First complaint to Dutch development bank FMO admitted,FMO ,Netherlands,Barro Blanco dam project ,energy plants - dams,Panama,"
FMO's 
Independent Complaints Mechanism (ICM) determined that the complaint submitted 
by Panamanian indigenous communities has met its admissibility criteria and will 
move on to the next phase. The complaint, filed on May 5 2014, alleged that FMO 
failed to ensure free prior and informed consent was obtained before financing 
the Barro Blanco hydropower project that would result in the flooding of 
indigenous lands.
 ""We are pleased 
that the ICM has acted so quickly to move the complaint to the next phase. Time 
is of the essence now, as the construction of the dam nears completion,"" said 
Kristen Genovese of the Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations 
(SOMO). The ICM's independent experts will next begin to discuss the issues with 
the parties and review available documentation related to the project. Following 
this preliminary review phase, the ICM will determine whether to convene a 
dialogue, conduct an investigation, or both.
 ""The fact that 
independent experts will look into the grievances of the Ngöbe communities is of 
enormous importance. The affected communities have raised the failure to obtain 
free prior and informed consent on many occasions and in many different fora. 
The fact that the ICM of the Dutch development bank FMO, although late in the 
process, will now engage with them and look into the responsibility of the bank 
is definitely an important step forward,"" said Anouk Franck, senior policy 
officer at Both ENDS.
 In a recent 
letter addressed to the FMO, the Movimiento 10 de Abril (M-10), a group that 
represents members of the indigenous community directly affected by the Barro 
Blanco Dam, reiterated their demand that FMO withdraw their funding from the 
project.
 ""We were never 
consulted on this project. The things that will be lost because of this dam, 
cannot be compensated by money. No adequate environmental and social impact 
study was done and the respect of the human rights of the population cannot be 
guaranteed"", states Manolo Miranda from M-10.
 Awaiting the 
finalization of the dam, community members remain in their encampment along the 
banks of the Tabasará River to prevent machinery from entering their 
land.     "

Berkeley ",Major Victory in Patagonia - Chile Unanimously Rejects HidroAysén,,,HidroAysén dam ,energy plants - dams,Chile,"
It's not every day we celebrate a victory as significant and hard-won as today's triumph in the eight-year campaign to protect Chilean Patagonia from the destructive HidroAysén dam project!
This morning, Chile's highest administrative authority - the Committee of Ministers - made a unanimous decision to overturn the environmental permits for the controversial five dam mega-project, which was planned on the Baker and Pascua rivers. This highly anticipated resolution effectively cancels the project, ruling that assessment of the project's impacts was insufficient to grant project approval back in 2011.
The Committee, which consists of the Minister of Environment, Health, Economy, Energy and Mining, Agriculture, and Tourism, evaluated 35 appeals which were filed by the Patagonia Defense Council and local citizens in response to the project's Environmental Impact Assessment after it was approved in May 2011. Though it has taken more than three years, with meetings and decisions being repeatedly delayed and eventually passed on to the new administration, today's decision is a recognition of the technical and procedural flaws surrounding HidroAysén as well as the significant impacts the project would have had on one of Chile's most iconic regions. 
What began as a grassroots effort to protect the pristine Baker and Pascua rivers, and the communities and culture of Patagonia, has developed into a fully-fledged international campaign and galvanized a national environmental movement. Over the past four years Chileans have taken to the streets to demand a halt to HidroAysén and around the world an international community has rallied around this call. Today it is these voices that have won out, and together have set in motion a new path towards a bright future for Patagonia and the hope of a truly sustainable energy future for Chile.
To borrow some words from Patricio Rodrigo, Executive Secretary of the Patagonia Defense Council, ""The government's definitive rejection of the HidroAysén project is not only the greatest triumph of the environmental movement in Chile, but marks a turning point, where an empowered public demands to be heard and to participate in the decisions that affect their environment and lives.""
We are thrilled that the government is siding with the majority of Chileans and tens of thousands of people around the world to say no to HidroAysén! We commend President Bachelet for remaining loyal to her campaign promise that HidroAysén would not have her support. And we are looking to the future, with the hope that measures will be put in place to protect this unique region from future threats. (In fact, President Bachelet and the Minister of Environment recently formalized a billthat would create the Department of Biodiversity and Protected Areas (SBAP) with the aim to preserve critical ecosystems throughout Chile.)
If you listen carefully you may be able to hear the celebrations coming all the way from Plaza Italia in Santiago where hundreds of people are gathering for HidroAysén's despedida (goodbye party)! We hope that you will join in the celebrations - you can send your own message over Facebook or Twitter using the hashtag #chaohidroaysen and #patagoniasinrepresas.
Whether you joined our online actions over the past month or have stood with us since International Rivers began campaigning for Patagonia Sin Represas in 2007, your support has been critical in cancelling this destructive project for good. Thank you for your continued support and commitment to saving Patagonia's wild rivers. For a Patagonia Sin Represas!

President Obama has taken an important step to confront climate change. The goal to reduce carbon emissions by 30% in 2030 will put a lot of pressure on the coal industry,
as it provides for almost half of US electricity generation. The
dependency on coal has to be cut back in Europe as well. FairFin, Climaxi and
BankTrack ask banks to take their responsability.
Who
thinks coal is a case of far away or long ago, is mistaken. In Europe alone, 71
new (!) coal plants are planned. This despite the fact
that coal is one of the most polluting ways 
of generating energy. Moreover, a choice for coal blocks the transition
to a green energy provision.
""We
are here to protect public health and the environment,"" says EPA
Administrator Gina McCarthy. The US wants to set
an example in the world and shows that this can only be done by taking
difficult decisions that force the industry to change. If the US can
do it, why can't Europe?  
Five banks
active in Belgium invest €1.38 billion in
coal
The choice for coal is largely maintained
by investments made by 'our' banks in coal companies like RWE, Vattenfall and
PGE. BNP Paribas invests €668.2 million in those three companies, Deutsche Bank €575.4 million, ING €98.6 million, Belfius €26.5 million and KBC €17 million.
FairFin,
Climaxi and BankTrack call on banks to stop funding new coal plants, invest in renewable
energy, create proper sustainable savings and investment products, provide
cheap credit to green projects and only call their services or products 'green'
or 'sustainable' if they can prove they are.
Action plant a power plant
Bank
clients can ask for 'seed bombs' at the FairFin office, which they can plant
near the banks investing in coal. The banks' gardens will soon blossom in
beauty, hopefully their investments will as well.

Bayonne ",Action in Bayonne against Société Générale and Alpha Coal,Société Générale ,France,,,,"
Today in France, activists brought the polluting reality of French bank Société Générale's investments in coal to their doorstep - by dumping 1.8 tonnes of coal outside their headquarters in Bayonne.
The bank provides financial assistance for the Alpha Coal project in Queensland, Australia, which is set to produce coal that would release at least 1.8 billion tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. Should the project succeed, it will be followed up with 8 others - which together would release almost as much CO2 as the annual emissions of Germany.
Members of the Basque environmental group Bizi! - affiliated with Les Amis de la Terre/Friends of the Earth France - arrived outside the bank early in the morning with two trucks, dumping the coal before holding up banners demanding that Société Générale ""Stop Alpha Coal"".

The action had tremendous popular support: in order to fund the truck rental and the purchase of the coal, Bizi! had launched a crowdfunding operation with the goal of collecting €3 800. Yet in just two weeks they had raised €4 500 from individuals opposed to polluting fossil fuels.
Jon Palais, a representative of Bizi! said: ""Our campaign alongside ATTAC-France and Friends of the Earth will grow, and won't stop until Société Générale ceases its support for 'climaticide'. If it persists it could become one of the targets of the international movement against dirty energy in the run-up to next year's climate talks in Paris""
Through actions like these, banks are increasingly being forced to consider the environmental impacts of their investments. In May, Deutsche Bank sold its shares in the destructive palm oil trader Bumitama after months of campaigning by Friends of the Earth Europe, and pressure remains on several other banks to stop funding another palm oil giant - Wilmar International.

Nijmegen ",BankTrack releases 2013 Annual Report,,,,,,"
We are very pleased to announce the release
today of our Annual
Report for 2013.
The report gives a concise summary of the activities
and achievements of the BankTrack network in 2013. It includes an update on five of our main campaigns: Banks and
Palm Oil, Banks and Human Rights, Coal Banks, Chinese Banks and Tracking the
Equator Principles. It also gives details on the most important Dodgy Deals tracked by the network in
2013, including the Agua Zarca dam in Honduras, the POSCO steel project in
India, and the Coal and Gas Projects near Australia's Great Barrier Reef. And
it gives an overview of the bank-focused work of our member and partner organisations around the world.
Some highlights include:

Since the start of
2013 we have welcomed five new organisations to the BankTrack network: Japan Center for a Sustainable Environment and
Society (JACSES) and World Development Movement as members, and Facing Finance,
London Mining Network and the European Environmental Paper Network as partners.
 Together with
urgewald, CEE Bankwatch Network and the Polish Green Network, we launched the Banking on Coal report at the UN
Climate Change Conference in Warsaw, part of a growing campaign urging banks
around the world to quit the dirty coal industry.
 We lobbied the banking
sector to develop stronger policies on
climate change and human rights, through engagement with Equator Principles and
Thun Group banks.
 Our campaigning helped
score victories for the environment
and society as the Pascua Lama gold mine on the border of Chile and Argentina
and the HidroAysen dam in Chile were both suspended, Coal India's share offer
collapsed, and a number of US and European Banks stepped back from
finance for Mountaintop Removal coal mining.

Frankfurt am Main ",Deutsche Bank divests from Bumitama,Deutsche Bank ,Germany,Palm Oil Plantations in the Sambas District ,agriculture - palm oil ,Indonesia,"
Deutsche Bank has told Friends of the Earth Europe and Rettet den 
Regenwald that it sold its shares in the Indonesian palm oil supplier 
Bumitama, an important supplier to palm oil giant Wilmar, following 
months of campaigning by the two groups. Despite numerous promises to 
clean up its act, Bumitama continues to produce illegal palm oil.
Bumitama
 supplies palm oil to one of the largest global traders in palm oil, 
Wilmar International, and received financial support from well-known 
European banks including HSBC, Deutsche Bank and Rabobank. Deutsche 
Bank's announcement was made during their AGM on Thursday May 22nd, 
after the German NGO Rettet den Regenwald presented 87,900 signatures 
from German citizens calling on Deutsche Bank to divest from Bumitama.
Rettet den Regenwald spokesperson Mathias Rittgerott, who presented the signatures to Anshu Jain and Juergen Fitschen - the CEOs of Deutsche Bank - commented: ""It
 is high time that a financial institution like Deutsche Bank listens to
 the voices of both its customers and German citizens. We do not support
 palm oil production, and we do not want Deutsche Bank to give any 
support to destructive palm oil companies.""
Friends of the 
Earth Europe and Walhi-Friends of the Earth Indonesia have led campaigns
 against Deutsche Bank's investments since October 2013.
Anton P. Widjaya, director of Walhi-Friends of the Earth West Kalimantan said: ""Deutsche
 Bank's divestment from Bumitama is a good start towards cleaning up the
 mess of Bumitama and this step must be followed by other banks and 
investors who wish to invest responsibly.""
Friends
 of the Earth Europe presented participants at the Deutsche Bank 
shareholder meeting in Frankfurt with numerous cases of land-grabbing by
 Wilmar in Africa and Indonesia, including cases by Bumitama. Mr. 
Fitschen responded that Deutsche Bank is in dialogue with Wilmar but is 
not ready to divest from palm oil companies in general because there is 
as of yet no alternative to palm oil.
Anne van Schaik, sustainability campaigner at Friends of the Earth Europe said: ""Deutsche
 Bank has taken a positive first step. Now it must continue along this 
path by divesting from Wilmar, who despite promises to improve its 
behaviour, have not solved its problems in the countries where they 
operate. The palm oil sector has so many cases of land grabbing, 
deforestation and environmental degradation that there is no excuse for 
responsible financiers to invest in it.""
American
 and European financiers hold €371 million worth of shares in Wilmar, 
and have €1.1 billion in loans outstanding to Wilmar. In the 
Netherlands, ING holds more than €26 million in shares; the British bank
 HSBC holds €298 million in loans, while BNP Paribas and Dutch Rabobank 
hold €189 million and €111 million respectively. Deutsche Bank holds €4 
million in shares and €12 million in outstanding loans. "

London ",HSBC AGM: Protestors to tell HSBC to pull out of coal,HSBC ,United Kingdom,,,,"
Protestors from the World Development Movement will tell HSBC to pull out of coal at its AGM on Friday 23 May, accusing the bank of fuelling climate change and ruining the lives of people living with the effects of coal mining worldwide.
Coal-gobbling 'bankers' will be strewn over an HSBC logo, joined by protestors holding placards reading, 'HSBC out of coal'.
HSBC has provided the global coal mining industry with £2.1 billion since 2005. It finances more fossil fuel extraction overall than any other UK bank.
HSBC finances coal mining by companies including Anglo American, Glencore-Xstrata and BHP Billiton, the companies behind the Cerrejón mine in Colombia. Cerrejón is South America's biggest coal mine, and has wiped whole villages from the map. It is fiercely opposed by the local Wayúu indigenous people whose land it has destroyed.
Yasmin Romero Epiayu, a Wayúu woman from the area of Colombia affected by the mine, said: ""We suffer from the coal dust 24 hours a day. It's like a black smoke that's there all the time.""
The World Development Movement's director Nick Dearden said today: ""Coal is the worst of all fossil fuels, both for the people whose lives it destroys, and for the global climate. If HSBC's claim to be a low-carbon bank is to have any credibility at all, it must stop pouring money into coal.""

Frankfurt ",Deutsche Bank receives Black Planet Award at AGM,Deutsche Bank ,Germany,Great Barrier Reef Coal & Gas Exports ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,Australia,"
A broad coalition  of environmental and human rights organisations is calling on the Deutsche Bank to finally start the much-needed cultural change towards sustainability.
This Thursday sees a large number of NGOs protesting in front of the Annual General Meeting of Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt against the bank's destructive business policy. They will present the International ethecon Black Planet Award. ""This award goes to the two CEOs Fitschen and Jain as well as the major shareholders of Deutsche Bank, as they are in many ways involved in the destruction of our earth, turning it into a black planet ,"" says Axel Köhler Schnura from the Foundation ethecon.
""A bank that claims to act according to high environmental and social standards must not take advantage of massive climate damage, human rights violations and international arms deals,"" criticises Thomas Küchenmeister, managing director of Facing Finance.
The environmentalists especially point towards the financing of coal by Deutsche Bank. ""Deutsche Bank likes to present itself as a climate protector and climate ambassador,"" says Heffa Schücking, director of the environmental organization Urgewald. ""At the same time, it is one of the top financiers of the coal industry worldwide. Between 2005 and January 2014, it has helped large coal companies worldwide with more than 15 billion euros. They do not shy away from financing controversial companies such as Coal India, or Glencore, which cause massive environmental destruction and climate damage. This schizophrenia between aspiration and reality of Deutsche Bank must finally end. Deutsche Bank must stay away from destructive projects and companies,"" states Schücking .
Currently, Deutsche Bank is under pressure, as on the East Coast of Australia, a deep-sea port will be expanded to transport coal. This is only 50 kilometers from the Great Barrier Reef, the largest coral reef on Earth. The coal port expansion threatens the sensitive ecosystem.  ""What currently is planned at Abbot Point puts at risk the Great Barrier Reef and industries reliant on it remaining a healthy ecosystem,""  says Tony Brown, chair of the Whitsunday Charter Boat Industry Association. ""Deutsche Bank should not consider supporting financially the expansion of the coal port with all its environmental problems. Therefore, I will call on Mr. Jain and Mr. Fitschen at the Annual Shareholder Meeting to not support such an environmental scandal and to exclude any financing for this project categorically. ""
Large weapon manufacturers - producing nuclear weapons and drones - are still funded by the bank. Thus the bank benefits big time from the global trade in arms. Deutsche Bank business relationships to nuclear weapons manufacturers amounts to almost 3 billion euros. Through this the Bank supports maintaining, upgrading and development of weapons, the use of which is threatening our livelihood. The Bank apparently doesn't follow the global disarmament approach ""Global Zero"", which is supported by the German federal government.
The NGO coalition also opposes the provision of financial services for land grabs and human rights abuses of palm oil companies like Wilmar in Indonesia, Uganda, Nigeria and Liberia.
The continous involvement of the Bank in food speculation sparks criticism, too. According to the UN (FAO), food prices have risen to a record high last year. Development organizations and multilateral institutions like the World Bank believe that commodity futures of banks have enormous impact on the prices of food and can raise them. ""Deutsche Bank is still one of the largest international food speculators,"" says David Hachfeld , food speculation expert at Oxfam. ""While other banks have dropped this business, Deutsche Bank still offers its customers investment funds betting  on rising prices of agricultural commodities. If prices explode, people in developing countries can no longer afford to buy food. Rather than stopping their risky transactions, Deutsche Bank plays a game with the public. Two years ago they announced a comprehensive analysis on food speculation, but to date the Bank hasn't published anything substantial.""

Brussels/Berlin ",The broken promises of Wilmar and its financiers,,,Wilmar International ,agriculture - palm oil ,Singapore,"
Wilmar International, one of the world's largest palm oil traders, continue 
their abusive practices of deforestation and land-grabbing, despite promises to 
stop, according to new research from Friends of the Earth in Indonesia, Liberia, 
Uganda and Nigeria .Wilmar's new ""No Deforestation, No Peat, No 
Exploitation"" policy declaring an end to deforestation, exploitation and peat 
conversion was published in December last year, but has been followed by 
numerous reports of continued environmental and social problems with Wilmar's 
palm oil operations in Liberia, Nigeria, Uganda and Indonesia - some of which 
contradict their new policy, according to the organisations .In 
Indonesia, Wilmar continues to purchase palmoil from Bumitama Agri, which is 
operating a plantation without the necessary permits, thereby bringing illegal 
palm oil into the supply chain. In Nigeria, Wilmar is still grabbing forestland 
in the vicinity of Afi Wildlife Sanctuary, close to the Cross River National 
Park Okwangwo Division, which contains high-conservation value forest. This 
territory is a buffer zone to the wildlife sanctuary of the National Park and 
Afi Forest reserve.Anne van Schaik, accountable finance 
campaigner at Friends of the Earth Europe, said: ""Wilmar International 
has changed its tune, but it is still singing the same song. Its positive words 
and progressive-sounding policy hide a complete lack of adequate action on the 
ground. It is time for financiers to stop dragging their feet and acknowledge 
this. They need to immediately divest from Wilmar, and cut their links with 
deforestation and land-grabbing.""American and European financiers 
hold €371 million worth of shares in Wilmar, and have €1.1 billion in loans 
outstanding to Wilmar. In the Netherlands, ING holds more than €26 million in 
shares; the British bank HSBC holds €298 million in loans, while BNP Paribas and 
Dutch Rabobank hold €189 million and €111 million respectively. Deutsche Bank 
holds €4 million in shares and €12 million in outstanding 
loans.Following discussions with Wilmar during a visit to Indonesia, the 
Friends of the Earth groups remain seriously concerned about Wilmar's commitment 
to sustainability . Friends of the Earth Europe is calling on Wilmar's 
financial backers to stop investing in the company until it ends deforestation, 
adheres to national laws in the countries where it operates, and applies Free 
Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) in all of its operations, including returning 
lands acquired without communities' consent.***NOTES:

Frankfurt ",Deutsche Bank says No to Financing of Coal Harbor on the Great Barrier Reef,Deutsche Bank ,Germany,Carmichael coal mine project ,mining - coal  | transport and infrastructure,Australia,"
Today, Banktrack members urgewald and Market Forces visited Deutsche Bank's shareholder meeting in Frankfurt, together with Tony Brown, a tourism operator from the Great Barrier reef and advisor to the marine park authorities.
In response to questions by Mr. Brown and the NGOs, Deutsche Bank Co-Chair Juergen Fitschen responded by saying that ""as there is clearly no consensus between the Australian Government and the UNESCO, regarding the impacts of the Abbot Point expansion on the Reef, we will not consider financial applications for an expansion of Abbot Point."" The head of Deutsche Bank's Supervisory Board, Mr. Paul Achleitner also said ""We are currently not involved with this project and will also not be involved with it in the future.""
""We are incredibly happy that Deutsche Bank has come out and said ""No"" to Abbot Point. I seems that banks are more protective of the reef than our own government ,""  says Mr. Brown.
Heffa Schuecking, director of the German NGO ""urgewald"" comments: ""Deutsche Bank took an important first step and we commend them for it. But the planned coal terminals are only one station of a much wider project, which entails the development of new coal mines in Australia's Galillee Basin and building a railway to bring the coal to Abbot Point. We will therefore watch closely whether Deutsche Bank funds any part of this project.""
The decision of Deutsche Bank comes after weeks of intense campaigning by a wide coalition of groups throughout Europe and Australia and involved a full page ad being placed in the European Financial Times calling on Deutsche Bank to not fund the Abbot Point expansion, a 200,000 strong online petition and hundreds of emails being sent directly to the bank urging it to take a strong stance.
""We urgently need financial institutions to step in and show that they take reef protection serious"", says Julien Vincent from the Australian NGO ""Market Forces"". Credit Agricole and Deutsche Bank have now both made statements that preclude finance for a project that would endanger the Great Barrier Reef. Surely if European banks are making this commitment, we could expect the same from the large Australian banks. If we want to preserve the reef, other banks now need to follow"", he adds.

Paris ",Crédit Agricole challenged at AGM to stop finance for mountain destruction,Crédit Agricole ,France,Mountain top removal coal mining ,mining - coal ,United States,"
Friends of the Earth France (FoE France) today challenged the disastrous environmental and social impacts of Crédit Agricole's investments in the coal sector at the bank's Annual General Meeting (AGM) in Paris.  The NGO asks Crédit Agricole to follow the example of BNP Paribas, which ended its ties with the main companies active in the field of ""mountaintop removal"", an extreme coal mining technique used in Appalachia, USA.
After attending the AGMs of BNP Paribas last week and Société Générale yesterday, FoE France today challenges Crédit Agricole on its investments in the coal industry, and more specifically its support for Arch Coal and Alpha Natural Resources, two coal producers using  ‘mountaintop removal'- MTR, a coal mining technique that has disastrous environmental, health and social consequences. FoE France called on Crédit Agricole to follow the example of BNP Paribas, which recently black-listed major companies practicing this damaging coal mining technique.
Indeed last year, following pressure from FoE France at their AGMs (1), both BNP and Crédit Agricole published sector policies partly related to MTR (2). Lucie Pinson, Finance Campaigner at Friends of the Earth, commented: ""Crédit Agricole's metals and mining sector policy  is no exception among banks' sector policies: the vocabulary is unclear and leaves much room for interpretation​​. It is no surprise that after adopting apparently similar policies, Credit Agricole and BNP Paribas have drawn completely opposite conclusions; one refraining from providing financial services to major companies active in MTR and the other continuing to finance and support them.""
Paul Corbit Brown, from the Appalachian organization Keepers of the Mountains, which accompanied Friends of the Earth to the AGM, added: ""By supporting Arch Coal and Alpha Natural Resources, which count among the top three mining companies active in MTR, Crédit Agricole participates in the destruction of one of the most beautiful mountain ranges in the world. The coal industry uses more than 3,000 tons of explosives daily to blow up our mountains, burying thousands of miles of rivers and causing rains to spread poisons in our communities. MTR is not just an environmental crime but is a real danger to people, and we are seeing cancer cases multiply.""
These problems have also not gone unnoticed by the Working Group on UN Business and Human Rights, which after having traveled to West Virginia to collect the testimonies of people affected by the practice of MTR, commissioned an investigation into allegations of violations of human rights (3) by the companies.
Producers and their financiers are now caught by the reputational, regulatory and financial costs of this controversial practice. Many companies involved in MTR, including clients of Crédit Agricole, are now facing serious financial difficulties. For example, only last month the bank forced Trinity Coal, a subsidiary of the Indian mining company Essar, to file for involuntary bankruptcy (4).
Lucie Pinson concludes: ""MTR is only the tip of the iceberg: Crédit Agricole has supported coal mining companies with more than two billion euros in lending and underwiting since 2005. Beyond the issue of MTR, Crédit Agricole must support the energy transition and replace its investments in fossil fuels with investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy.""

Paris ",Société Générale pressured to step out of Alpha Coal project before AGM starts,Société Générale ,France,GVK ,energy plants - coal | mining - coal  | oil and gas,India,"
Friends of the Earth France, Bizi! and Attac will organize several actions throughout France today and tomorrow against Société Générale's support for the Alpha Coal Project. Friends of the Earth France will today meet the bank, together with two Australian representatives, and submit a letter, co-written with Bizi!, providing additional information on the project (1). Attac and Friends of the Earth France will be present tomorrow at the bank's Annual General Meeting, and hope that the additional information will be sufficient to convince it to withdraw from Alpha Coal before tomorrow night. If it does not, Bizi! has threatened to pour 1.8 tons of coal, marked ""Return to Sender"", in front of the bank's regional headquarters in Bayonne in a symbolic protest (2).
Société Générale will hold its AGM tomorrow, the last day of the ultimatum by French environmental campaign group Bizi!, based in the Basque Country. The Alpha Coal project has been raising the ire of the international civil society for over a year due to its impacts on the climate, people, the environment and biodiversity. After the occupation of the bank last week in Bayonne by Bizi! (3), Friends of the Earth France, Bizi! and Attac are organizing new actions today and tomorrow with the same request: the immediate withdrawal of Société Générale from the Alpha Coal project. ""We meet the bank today at its headquarters in Paris and we hope that the new information that we will present will be sufficient this time to convince it to follow the example of Crédit Agricole, which refused to participate in financing the port of Abbot Point terminal (4),"" said Lucie Pinson, private finance campaigner for Friends of the Earth France.
Tony Brown, a tourism operator from the Whitsunday Islands in the Great Barrier Reef, who will accompany Friends of the Earth, continues: ""The port expansion at Abbot Point requires dredging of three million square metres of seabed in the area of ​​the Great Barrier Reef, the equivalent of a wall five meters high and one meter wide extending from Paris to Milan. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority recognized that decisions in this area will determine the future of the Great Barrier Reef over the long term. However, the project threatens not only the reefs and the economic sectors that rely on it, but also the cultural and symbolic value of the location. The fact that a large international bank like Société Générale supports such a project is incomprehensible. ""
""By contributing to the emission of 1.8 billion tons of carbon dioxide over 30 years and opening the door to other mining projects equally disastrous for the climate in the Galilee Basin, the Alpha Coal project will significantly worsen climate change. The planet would not stand it and we have no choice but to mobilize to stop such climate-wrecking projects. Civil society is now united on both sides of the world to fight against the banks that support fossil fuels. More than 1,000 people have recently left their bank in Australia, and a similar fate awaits Société Générale if it does not immediately withdraw from Alpha Coal,"" says Julien Vincent from the Australian NGO Market Forces.
Already, several customers of Société Générale have left the bank because of its involvement in Alpha Coal and joined Friends of the Earth France, Attac and Bizi! in the battle for its withdrawal from the project. Actions will be held in several cities in France today and tomorrow, including Bayonne, Bordeaux, Nice, Limoges, Dijon and Paris. Activists will be present tomorrow at the bank's AGM, while outside, activists dressed as kangaroos and marine animals from the Great Barrier Reef will welcome the shareholders, and Attac will award the bank with a 'Golden Shark Polluter Award'. Inside, Friends of the Earth along with Tony Brown and Julien Vincent will call on the bank's Board and shareholders with a common request: the immediate and public withdrawal of Société Générale from the Alpha Coal project. Otherwise, the NGOs will intensify their mobilization, starting with Bizi!'s ""Return to Sender"" action.

Paris ","BNP Paribas results disastrous for climate and taxation, say campaigners at today’s AGM",BNP Paribas ,France,Tufanbeyli coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Turkey,"
As BNP Paribas shareholders today gather for the bank's AGM, Friends of the Earth France and the Responsible Shareholders Association will be present to call out the bank for its support for the coal sector and its involvement in tax heavens. BNP Paribas is one of the world's top 10 ""coal banks"", and is more involved in offshore tax havens than any other company in France.
""BNP Paribas is the French bank the most active in greenwashing, never hesitating to present itself as a responsible bank committed to fight climate change. The bank is however often behind the financing of the most carbon intensive projects in the world"", said Lucie Pinson, private finance campaigner for Friends of the Earth France. She continued: ""To mention just one example, BNP Paribas is the only international private bank to have contributed to the financing of the giant Tata Mundra coal power plant in India (1), an iconic case of the issues plaguing coal power"".
Pollution of rivers, destruction of mangroves, threat to the survival of local fishermen, displacement of communities, multiplication of respiratory diseases, electricity price increases, 30 million tons of CO2 emitted each year: the list of the consequences of the Tata Mundra power plant is very long (2). However the plant, which is eight times bigger than a ""normal"" coal power plant, is no anomaly in the bank's portfolio. BNP Paribas has also financed coal plants including Kusile and Medupi in South Africa, and plants using lignite - the most polluting kind of coal - like the Tufanbeyli power plant in Turkey.
Another issue on which NGOs will remind shareholders is the involvement of France's biggest bank in tax heavens. ""The French champion of tax heavens, BNP Paribas organises the avoidance of several million euros in tax, notably at the expense of the public budgets of developing countries, and puts in jeopardy its commitment to fiscal civic responsibility. Moreover, the legal but complex financial arrangements that BNP Paribas sets up for its international customers contributes to the lack of transparency in international finance"", notes Johan Bosch, representative of the Responsible Shareholders Association.
A year ago, BNP Paribas announced at its AGM the imminent publication of a new policy on mining activities, in which it committed to not finance Mountaintop Removal (MTR), the extreme practice of coal extraction by blowing up mountain tops. The policy is now effective, and BNP Paribas has not financed the main companies active in MTR since its publication. But for Friends of the Earth France, its role as the world's eighth biggest ""Coal Bank"" means BNP remains far from being a responsible, ethical business.
""Blacklisting the main companies active in MTR is laudable, but it is the whole coal sector that BNP Paribas must exclude. And while the bank had 142 more subsidiaries in tax heavens two years ago compared with today, it still has 218 to close down!"" (3) concludes Lucie Pinson, reminding shareholders that it is possible for BNP Paribas to change its investment policy by prioritising projects fighting climate change (efficiency, renewables) and that if it does not act, its customers can leave it for a more responsible bank.

Edinburgh ",Protestors to target Lloyds AGM over coal investments,Lloyds Banking Group ,United Kingdom,Cerrejón coal mine ,mining - coal ,Colombia,"
Protestors will target the Lloyds Bank AGM in Edinburgh on Thursday 15 May, accusing it of destroying people's lives and fuelling climate change by bankrolling the global coal industry. Protestors from the World Development Movement will hold placards reading ‘Lloyds: Stop Bankrolling Coal' and will play on Lloyds' marketing with a banner reading ‘Because Climate Change Matters'. Lloyds has invested a total of £3.4 billion since 2009 in mining giants BHP Billiton, Anglo American and Glencore Xstrata, the companies behind the massive Cerrejón mine in Colombia. Cerrejón is the biggest coal mine in South America and is fiercely opposed by local people, including the indigenous Wayúu whose territory it has destroyed. BHP Billiton, which alone has received £2.1 billion from Lloyds since 2009, plans to open coal mines across a vast area of the Indonesian rainforest. World Development Movement climate and energy campaigner Alex Scrivener said today: ""The coal industry is destroying lives and livelihoods on every continent with the help of Lloyds and the other coal-addicted big banks. For the sake of the people suffering from coal mining, and the sake of the global climate, Lloyds should pull out of coal."" Yasmin Romero Epiayu, a Wayúu woman from Colombia, said: ""We need a global campaign against these banks. They're violating peoples' fundamental rights. It's not just Cerrejón. It's happening in Indonesia too. It's happening all over the world. They say they're investing in development. But their money is contaminated with blood.""

In November 2013 Deutsche Bank joined with Commonwealth Bank and Westpac to loan Adani $1.2 billion for Abbot Point, a 50 million tonne per year coal export terminal in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. The loan had already been refinanced twice since Adani bought the terminal in 2011, but this time around a raft of banks left the deal including Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, Standard Chartered, Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizuho and National Australia Bank. We don't know why Deutsche Bank suddenly showed this appetite for financing a coal port at half capacity at the end of a coal boom, especially with so many other banks walking away, but it makes it far more likely that Deutsche will be one of the banks approached to fund Adani's major coal export expansion plans.
Adani's big plans for the Galilee Basin and Abbot Point.
Adani has Queensland Government approval to construct a 60 million tonne per year coal mine in the Galilee Basin. This would make their mine twice the size of Australia's biggest coal mine to date. Connected to the mine is a rail line and port development at Abbot Point. Should these projects proceed, they could open the door to additional mines that bring the total mined output from the Galilee Basin to over 300 million tonnes per year of new thermal coal - enough to increase global greenhouse gases by almost 1 billion tonnes of CO2 per year.
Aside from the obviously unacceptable climate implications of the Galilee Basin mines proceeding, other notable environmental impacts include:

the dewatering of the Galilee Basin region,
spread of coal dust locally and throughout the rail corridor,
the risk of flooding events spreading polluting from coal mines and railed coal,
construction of export infrastructure on sensitive coastal wetland and impacts on threatened bird species,
construction of port infrastructure in the marine environment and impacts in threatened aquatic life,
dredging operations that would remove 3 million cubic metres of seabed and dump it at sea
increases in shipping, leading to a four-fold increase in the number of coal ships traversing the reef by 2030

The World Heritage Committee has become extremely concerned at the state of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area and its management, in particular the ongoing approvals for coastal developments that would impact the Reef's Outstanding Universal Value as a World Heritage site. The recent report from the Committee cited the 3 million cubic metres of seabed that would be dredged and dumped at sea to make way for new coal terminals at Abbot Point as especially disappointing and will consider placing the Reef on the World Heritage ‘in Danger' list in 2015.
Our biggest concern is that having developed a relationship with Adani in support of the current coal export terminal, Deutsche Bank will be far more likely to be approached for future coal mining and export projects being pursued by Adani.
Take action!
In May 2014, Market Forces is joining major global environment groups to pressure Deutsche Bank over their fossil fuel investments and call for a commitment that they won't fund another coal export port at Abbot Point.

Deutche Bank's history of Australian fossil fuel lending
Deutsche Bank has loaned about $600 million to the fossil fuel industry in Australia since 2008. While that's fewer projects than other international banks, Deutsche Bank seems to have chosen to support some of the most destructive and controversial in Australia. Since 2008, DB has provided debt finance to:

Hazelwood Coal Power Station, Australia's dirtiest power station per unit of energy produced and scene of a weeks-long fire in February 2014 that engulfed nearby Morwell in hazardous pollution.
The Maules Creek Coal Mine, scene of a 2-year community presence which has grown and is now preventing construction on the project, and
Gladstone LNG, one of three LNG terminals under construction on Curtis Island, also in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. Dredging operations for the LNG terminals have decimated the harbour's marine environment and fishing industry.

Has Deutsche Bank read its own research?
In May 2013, Deutsche Bank released a Commodities Special Report ""Thermal Coal: At a Crossroads"". It observed that softening demand for coal in the US, EU and China would lead to an oversupplied market, the bear case they present resulting in coal costs in 2020 of $86/tonne in nominal terms. This is in line with many other predictions from the likes of HSBC, Citi and Bernstein forecasting an oversupplied market, weakening demand and lower coal prices, making future investments in the Galilee Basin coal mines or associated infrastructure a risky economic bet in addition to an environmentally unacceptable one.

Brussels ",New web tool helps Belgians check their bank's investments,,,,,,"
""A great deal of banks have not yet learned from the

Charlotte, North Carolina, United States ",Shareholders Press Bank of America  for Coal and Climate Finance,Bank of America ,United States,Mountain top removal coal mining ,mining - coal ,United States,"
An international coalition of shareholders and community leaders from as far away as Bogota, Colombia, testified to the grave impacts resulting from Bank of America's financing of the coal industry at the bank's Annual General Meeting today in downtown Charlotte. Shareholders also considered a resolution requesting the bank to report carbon emissions stemming from financing of carbon-intensive industries. Coal is the top contributor to greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) that cause climate change.
The proposed resolution voted on today requested that Bank of America provide an assessment and report on its financing of GHG emissions and was introduced by members of the Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility (ICCR), and endorsed by a coalition of institutional investors with nearly $35 billion in managed assets.
""Coal is still a big problem for Bank of America, as it continues to finance billions of dollars each year to the dirtiest companies in the business,"" said Ben Collins, Policy Campaigner for Rainforest Action Network. ""Shareholders proposed a resolution that the bank come clean on its accounting-- and report the climate consequences of its financing decisions in the light of day.""
In addition to potential ""stranded assets"" resulting from a changing climate, delegation members in today's shareholder meeting testified to the impacts and liabilities for the bank. Santiago Piñeros, an attorney with Social Thought and Action, a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) based in Bogota, Colombia, traveled to North Carolina to report on the risks the bank may face related to its financing of Drummond Coal.
""Bank of America invests in a coal company that does not respect environmental standards or human rights in Colombia,"" said Santiago Piñeros, Staff Attorney at Social Thought and Action in Colombia. ""The money from Bank of America is used by Drummond Company to threaten the right to a healthy life and environment in the communities where they operate. Drummond is a company that operates with no due diligence to protect and respect the human, economic and cultural rights of its workers and the people living near coal mines.""
After publicly resolving to phase out financing for companies engaged primarily in mountaintop removal (MTR) coal mining companies and after Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase phased out financing for the largest MTR producers, Bank of America financed 8.9% of the MTR market share, with $393 million in 2013.
""Bank of America needs to stop financing the destruction of our mountains, our water and my community,"" said Elise Keaton, Executive Director of Keeper of the Mountains, a member of today's delegation from West Virginia.  ""The minuscule profits the bank received as a result of mountaintop removal mining is incomparable to the catastrophic damage caused by the practice. It is killing us.""
Members of the coalition will also focus on Bank of America's exposure to Coal-fired power producers, including Duke Energy in North Carolina. Bank of America has maintained longstanding financial ties with Duke Energy and participated in numerous transactions with the energy giant. Duke is responsible for a recent massive coal ash spill in the Dan River where 39,000 tons of coal ash and 24 million gallons of coal ash wastewater was dumped into the river, as well as an intentional and illegal 61 million gallon coal ash wastewater dump in the Cape Fear River upstream from 840,000 people's drinking water supply.
""Bank of America must take some responsibility for contaminating North Carolina's waterways by financing irresponsible power companies like Duke Energy, who owns the most high hazard coal ash waste dumps in the country,"" said Kemp Burdette, the Cape Fear Riverkeeper. ""Bank of America engaged in extremely risky business by pursuing deals with companies like Duke, who illegally dumped 85 million gallons of toxic coal ash in North Carolina waterways in 2014.""
2014 marks the fourth consecutive year that Bank of America heard from impacted community members reporting on the effects of coal financing and the first year that shareholders voted on a resolution to measure and report on the greenhouse gas footprint of its financing portfolio. "

Kiad, Panama / Amsterdam ",Complaint filed against Dutch development bank FMO for funding the Barro Blanco dam in Panama,FMO ,Netherlands,Barro Blanco dam project ,energy plants - dams,Panama,"
On Monday May 5 2014, local groups in Panama filed a complaint against the FMO's investment in the Barro Blanco hydropower project with the Independent Complaints Mechanism (ICM), the recently established independent grievance mechanism of the FMO. The Barro Blanco dam (28,84 MW) is under construction on the Tabasará River in the Province of Chiriquí in western Panama. A part of the project (6.7 hectares) is located in Ngöbe-Buglé comarca (traditional indigenous territory), created by law in 1997.Once completed, the dam is projected to flood homes, schools, and religious, archaeological, and cultural sites in the comarca.  The dam will convert the Tabasará River from a running river to a stagnant lake ecosystem, resulting in significant changes to the Ngöbe's diet and landscape. The project will require that a part of the indigenous Ngöbe communities currently living on the shores of the river are removed from their land, to which they have strong cultural ties.Failure to obtain free prior and informed consentThe complaint cites as the main concern the FMO's failure to ensure that free prior and informed consent (FPIC) was obtained for the project. The complaint was filed by the Movimiento 10 de Abril (M-10), which was established in 1999 by the Ngöbe and farmers to promote the protection of the environment and to ensure their rights would be respected, mainly in the view of dam and mining development in the comarca. The movement represents the people directly affected by the Barro Blanco dam.The M-10 asserts that the FMO ignored its own policies before investing US$25 million in project developer GENISA in 2011. The FMO signed a contract with GENISA, even though they were aware of the M-10's criticism that the affected communities were not adequately consulted as part of the environmental and social impact assessment (EIA) and that FPIC had not been obtained for this project. A domestic lawsuit, which is still pending, was already filed in the Panamanian court challenging the approval of Barro Blanco's EIA in 2011, prior to FMO approving the loan.FMO should have ensured that the project respected the rights of the Ngöbe, in particular their right to FPIC.  FPIC is protected under the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which Panama voted in favour of at the UN General Assembly, and the American Convention on Human Rights, which Panama ratified in 1978.""During the assessment phase of this project by GENISA our population was not considered. We are not mentioned in the Environmental Impact Assessment of the Barro Blanco project. The UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, James Anaya, who visited us in 2013, and UNDP reports confirm that consultation was inadequate. "" said Weni Bagama, member of the M-10. Bagama and her family live in the village of Kiad, which will be severely affected by the dam.Request for independent investigationBoth ENDS and SOMO support the M-10's request that the ICM investigate the project and recommend a full withdrawal of FMO funds. Moreover, the complainants ask for FMO to use its leverage to ensure that the filling of the reservoir is postponed until the investigation is concluded.""The FMO promotes its commitment to environmental and socially responsible finance and issues sustainability bonds with a direct reference to its environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) standards,"" said Anouk Franck, a senior policy advisor at Both ENDS. ""But implementation of these standards falls short, as the Barro Blanco project shows, and the rights of communities are being violated as a result. A financial institution that takes its own human rights policy and international human rights standards serious, should not be involved in a project like this.""The construction of the dam is nearing completion and the process of forced eviction has begun. A first signal by Panama's National Public Services Authority (ASEP) that GENISA would be allowed onto their lands, in February 2014, was later annulled. The affected communities, however, remain fearful that the eviction could happen any time. This is why they created an encampment along the banks of the Tabasará River at the border of the Ngöbe-Buglé comarca and they plan to stay there as long as necessary to prevent machinery from entering their land.
""FMO's continued financing of the Barro Blanco dam as GENISA moves forward with this construction of the dam and attendant impacts to the Ngöbe constitutes a violation of Ngöbe rights, and an inappropriate use of the funds from an institution that is majority owned by the Government of the Netherlands"" said Kris Genovese, a senior researcher at SOMO. ""FMO should reevaluate its investment and pull out. We hope that the investigation by the ICM will help FMO come to that conclusion.""

Melbourne ",Big Four Australian banks lose customers over fossil fuel gamble,ANZ ,Australia,Carmichael coal mine project ,mining - coal  | transport and infrastructure,Australia,"
This weekend, hundreds of customers with Australia's biggest banks have shut down their accounts to protest the banks' lending to Australian coal and gas projects. Public divestment actions took place in fourteen cities and towns across Australia on 2nd and 3rd May, reflecting growing public dissatisfaction with fossil fuel expansion and numerous recent scandals casting doubt over government approvals processes.

Since May last year, thousands of customers have  ‘put their bank on notice' and pledged to move more than $120 million out of the Big Four banks unless they commit to ruling out future loans to coal and gas projects, say campaigners from 350.org Australia and Market Forces. ""This weekend, Australians turned up in force to take action against a system which is failing to protect us from unlawful coal and gas expansion and the impacts of climate change,"" commented Julien Vincent, Lead Campaigner from Market Forces. ""Companies which finance fossil fuel projects need to be aware of the growing financial and reputational risks involved in supporting climate change."" Since 2008, Westpac, ANZ, NAB and the Commonwealth Bank have loaned a collective $19 billion to new coal and gas projects, including the controversial Abbot Point coal terminal and the Maules Creek coal mine. The action has elicited mixed reactions from the banks with security at an ANZ branch in Hobart preventing customers from entering the bank to shut down their accounts and staff at an NAB branch in Brisbane informing customers that they couldn't close their accounts on a Saturday. The events, which took place across seven states, attracted a diverse mix of participants ranging from celebrity musician Felix Riebl to 96 year old Marie Nance Barker from Brisbane. Said Felix Riebl, lead singer of Aria winning band The Cat Empire said:  ""I realized I had a choice about where I put my money and how significant those choices can be from an environmental and ethical perspective. Switching banks was a simple and powerful choice."" Globally, the fossil fuel divestment movement has attracted its fair share of celebrity proponents including Archbishop Desmond Tutu, World Bank President Dr Jim Yong Kim and Head of the UNFCCC Christiana Figueres. Commented Evelyn Gyulkhandanyan, a Melbourne based mum: ""I arrived three months ago with my family with Armenia. Wherever you are in the world, Armenia or Australia, the situation is similar, fossil fuels are causing huge pollution. I'm here speaking as a mother and my concern is what we do now and how that will affect what will happen in a hundred years time. That's why I'm leaving the Comm bank today and moving to a bank which doesn't invest in fossil fuels."" Said Dr. Helen Redmond, a medical practitioner: ""I'm participating today because climate change is a public health emergency. Doctors have a duty of care to humanity to divest from fossil fuels."" "

Nijmegen ","Mizuho must lead by example as new Equator Principles chair, says BankTrack",Mizuho Financial Group ,Japan,,,,"
Today, as Mizuho Bank takes over from ING as the chair of the Equator Principles Association, the NGO network BankTrack calls on the Japanese bank to lead by example by meeting the new Equator Principles transparency requirements in full, and by taking significant steps to tackle the climate impacts of its lending.The latest version of the Equator Principles (EPIII) was launched in June last year and came into force on 1st January 2014, bringing with it new requirements for banks to report the names of projects financed to the Secretariat for publication on the Equator Principles website - subject to obtaining client consent.For higher risk projects (category A and, as appropriate, category B), EPIII also requires clients to disclose summaries of Environmental and Social Impact Assessments, as well as details of greenhouse gas emissions for high-emissions projects. However no such disclosures have yet been made, and no names of projects financed have yet been reported on the Equator Principles website.Mizuho Bank, which today becomes the first Asian chair of the Equator Principles, has huge exposure to the fossil fuel industry, and finances a number of ""dodgy deals"" being opposed by civil society groups and local organisations. The bank, one of Japan's three megabanks, was shown by BankTrack's recent Banking on Coal report to be among the world's top 30 financiers of the coal mining industry, ploughing over 1.2 billion euros into the sector since 2005.Its involvement includes being one of the top five financiers of Drummond, a US coal mining company which has been accused of having financed Colombia's paramilitary forces and which was ordered by the Colombian state to stop exporting coal from the country's ports earlier this year following an incident in which the company was fined USD 3.5m for spilling hundreds of tons of coal into the sea.Mizuho is also helping to finance the building of Southeast Asia's largest coal-fired power plant on Indonesia's Java island, the Batang Project, encouraging a dangerously misguided rush for coal power which will have devastating social and environmental impacts in the country, while pushing Indonesia down a catastrophic path towards climate change. Meanwhile the US, UK and Nordic governments, together with the World Bank, have committed not to finance new coal fired power plants except in exceptional circumstances.BankTrack Director Johan Frijns said: ""Four months on from EPIII officially coming into force, we have still not seen the Equator Principles Association publish details of any projects financed. As the first Asian chair of the Equator Principles, Mizuho has a chance to show the Equator Principles are serious on disclosure by publishing details of its project related finance as it happens, and ensuring others do the same.""""Mizuho's finance for projects like the Batang Coal Power Plant, the kind of project which many development banks will no longer touch, shows the importance of this kind of transparency. Under EPIII, banks must now ensure an ‘alternatives analysis' is carried out to evaluate less greenhouse gas intensive alternatives when financing projects with emissions of over 100,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent. In itself this is a weak requirement, as banks are under no obligation to pursue the less polluting alternatives they identify. However such an alternatives analysis should show clearly the madness of ploughing money into projects like dirty coal plants in Indonesia, further contaminating the air people breathe and contributing to dangerous climate change, when clean alternatives exist,""added Johan Frijns.

Sydney ",Australian banks backing companies accused of land grabs,ANZ ,Australia,,,,"
Australia's big four banks are backing companies accused of kicking people off their land, leaving them homeless and hungry, Oxfam Australia said today.
Oxfam Australia's report released today, Banking on Shaky Ground - Australia's big four banks and land grabs, includes evidence that ANZ, Westpac, National Australia Bank and the Commonwealth Bank have backed companies that have contributed to illegal logging, forced evictions, inadequate compensation, food shortages and child labour.
""From PNG and Cambodia to Indonesia and Brazil, our banks have backed companies accused of forcing people from their land,"" Oxfam Australia's Chief Executive Dr Helen Szoke said.
""This involvement has also resulted in billions of dollars of exposure for everyday Australians who have their money in accounts with these banks, or who own bank shares directly or through their superannuation funds.""
Dr Szoke said our banks were investing in Asia and the Pacific and have trumpeted these regions as an opportunity for growth, but the evidence showed they were unaware of or failing to respond to the risks of doing business there, particularly in the agricultural and timber industries.
Oxfam's investigations show the banks are on shaky ground with these investments, facing potential asset write downs and the possibility that foreign governments and courts will shut down land deals, resulting in significant financial loss and shareholder value for each bank.
In PNG, Westpac is supporting a timber company that is logging pristine rainforest in defiance of an explicit finding by PNG's Commission of Inquiry into Special Agricultural Business Leases that its lease was invalid and should be revoked.
In Cambodia, the ANZ Bank is financing a sugar plantation that has involved child labour, military backed land grabs, forced evictions and food shortages.
The Commonwealth Bank has invested in an agribusiness giant, whose Brazilian sugar mill is sourcing sugar from people occupying land in defiance of Brazilian laws that determined the Indigenous people evicted for the sugar plantation are the true owners of the land.
Across Asia, the NAB has been funding Asian Palm Oil giant Wilmar - which has been linked to land grab allegations in Indonesia and Malaysia, since 2011. A NAB loan last year came after Newsweek had ranked Wilmar as the least sustainable company in the world for its environmental performance for two years running. Whilst Wilmar has since taken steps to address land grabs, NAB has not.
Land grabs are a significant issue that has already been recognised by leading corporations including Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, and international financial institutions such as the World Bank, which have all adopted tough due diligence policies to prevent their involvement in land grabs.
""Investment in agriculture is vital to reduce global hunger, but it has to be done responsibly,"" Dr Szoke said.  ""The banks need to say which companies they're investing in, and where those companies have pushed people off the land, to work with those companies to change their practices and provide compensation to communities.""

",EPN welcomes Asia Pulp and Paper’s commitment on forest restoration and conservation,,,OKI Pulp & Paper Mills ,forestry - pulp and paper,Indonesia,"
The Environmental Paper Networks (EPN) of Europe and North America 
cautiously welcome today's announcement by Asia Pulp and Paper (APP) of a
 plan to work with global and local non-governmental organisations 
(NGOs) to restore and support the conservation of one million hectares 
of rainforest across Indonesia.
With its announcement, APP commits to all elements of ""The First 
Test"", a set of Performance Milestones developed by the EPN in September
 last year (1), to guide the company towards ending its controversial 
practices. The Milestones' scope is not intended as a standard for 
responsible paper production, but rather as a first step towards 
activity consistent with the EPN and EEPN Common Vision for sustainable 
paper production, trade and use (2).
""APP's announcement is a significant step forward towards addressing 
the legacy of its extensive negative impact on forests, peatlands and 
communities in Indonesia,"" said Sergio Baffoni, of the European 
Environmental Paper Network.
""Resolving and compensating for the company's past legacy of 
environmental and social impacts will require a number of years. 
Independent third party auditing to verify the implementation of these 
commitments by APP will help customers and investors to determine the 
actual progress towards the Performance Milestones in due course. We 
hope that these milestones can also help to guide action by other pulp 
and paper companies in Indonesia and elsewhere  to address their 
controversial heritage,"" said Joshua Martin, Director of the  
Environmental Paper Network in North America.
The forest conservation and restoration commitment is equivalent to 
the approximate area of plantations operated by APP suppliers in 2013 
and thus represents a 1 for 1 approach to addressing the company's 
legacy (3). Indonesia's rainforests are some of the most biologically 
diverse forests on the planet. They provide livelihoods to millions of 
people, they sustain the last habitats of Sumatran elephant, tiger, 
rhino and orang-utan, and their peat bogs sequester a massive amount of 
carbon. These forests however have been experiencing one of the world's 
highest rates of deforestation due to development of industrial 
plantations for commodities such as palm oil and pulp and paper.
For many years, APP has been criticised for its extensive clearance 
of tropical forests in Sumatra and Borneo, many of which were located on
 deep peat bogs and/or were the habitat of critically endangered 
elephants, tigers, rhinos and orang-utans. The deforestation has led to 
numerous conflicts with local and indigenous communities whose tenure 
rights were ignored.
After 30 years of operation, in February 2013 APP announced a new 
""Forest Conservation Policy"". The EPN's ""The First Test"" was a 
collective response to this policy by many NGOs, articulating a set of 
Performance Milestones that APP needed to achieve to address the gaps 
and weaknesses of their policy. These included the need for due process 
in ensuring local communities give full and prior-informed consent to 
use of their land, the need for forest restoration or compensation, 
closing of loop-holes in the policy regarding forest acquisitions, 
addressing damage to peat land, and ensuring independent third-party 
monitoring of progress in implementing the plan.
NGOs are now urging Indonesia's second-largest pulp and paper 
producer APRIL (Asia Pacific Resources International), part of the large
 conglomerate Royal Golden Eagle Group (RGE), to also comply with the 
EPN Milestones.
The Environmental Paper Network is a coalition of 122 NGOs from 26 
countries including Indonesia who share a Common Vision for a future 
where paper is produced and used sustainably.

Paris ",Victory for communities and environmental groups as proposed Kaliningrad nuclear plant is buried,Société Générale ,France,Baltic nuclear power plant- Kaliningrad ,energy plants - nuclear,Russian Federation,"
The Baltic nuclear power plant project in the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, a highly controversial project opposed by the local population, has been abandoned by the Russian authorities. Friends of the Earth France, whose campaign against Société Générale's financial support for this project contributed to its suspension, welcome this news, although they remain vigilant about the involvement of French banks in the nuclear sector . After months of uncertainty about its future, the nuclear power plant project in Kaliningrad, a Russian enclave between Poland and Lithuania, has now been abandoned by the Russian government. Challenged from the beginning by the local population, the project has been the subject of an international mobilization against Société Générale last year by Friends of the Earth.The proposed nuclear plant, backed by the Russian state-owned corporation Rosatom, raised many issues: a sloppy environmental impact assessment, a lack of emergency plans or decommissioning plans, a poor radioactive waste management program, corruption scandals and violations of the rights of local people. Finally, as well as being opposed by the population of Kaliningrad itself, the project was opposed by the very neighboring countries which were intended to be the plant's customers.""This project has gradually lost support from the Russian authorities and was not even mentioned during their discussions on the future of energy in the region in early April. Rosatom may continue its deceptive communication and try to make believe that the project is still on the agenda, but the company will not convince, neither here nor abroad. Nuclear power is too costly, too risky and the Russian and neighboring populations are clearly opposed to it,"" said Vladimir Slivyak of the Russian association Ecodefense.""The abandonment of this nuclear project, despite the wishes of the energy giant Rosatom, should send a strong signal to Société Générale. The bank was structuring the export finance for the project's Alstom turbines while BNP Paribas and Credit Agricole informed Friends of the Earth France they would not participate. However, it must not be forgotten that the French banks are among the main funders of the nuclear industry worldwide"" adds Lucie Pinson, private finance campaigner for Friends of the Earth France.""This project also exposes the role of France through its export credit agency, Coface, which was considering providing a guarantee for the export of the turbines for this project. We denounce the economic diplomacy of the French government, which is trying to sell nuclear abroad while at the same time deciding to reduce its share in the French energy mix, and we ask French banks to end their support for nuclear power. The abandonment of the Kaliningrad plant is good news but other dodgy deals are ongoing, such as nuclear power plant in Jaitapur in India, with the active interest of a number of French banks. We remain vigilant and we will certainly mobilize if necessary,"" said Lucie Pinson.     "

London ",Barclays AGM: Protestors to target Barclays for bankrolling coal,Barclays ,United Kingdom,Kaltim Prima Coal mine ,mining - coal ,Indonesia,"
Campaigners from the World Development Movement will protest at Barclays' AGM on Thursday 24 April, accusing the bank of fuelling climate change and destroying people's lives and the environment by financing the global coal industry. Where: Entrance to the Barclays AGM, Royal Festival Hall, South Bank, London SE1 8XXWhen: 10.30-11.30am, Thursday 24 April Two suited, blue masked Barclays ‘eagles' on Barclays bikes, carrying coal in their bike baskets, will join protestors holding placards reading, ‘Barclays: Stop bankrolling coal'. Barclays has provided the global coal mining industry with £3.1 billion since 2005. Coal burning releases more greenhouse gases per tonne than any other fossil fuel, driving climate change which disproportionately affects the world's poorest people. In Indonesia, Barclays has loaned £127 million to mining company Bumi Resources, responsible for evicting indigenous people in Indonesian Borneo from their land. Since 2009, it has also loaned £1.6 billion to BHP Billiton, which plans to open coal mines across a vast area of the Borneo rainforest. Barclays was also the top global financer of ‘mountaintop removal' coal mining in 2013. The tops of more than 500 mountains in the USA have been blasted off for coal. Banks JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and BNP Paribas have pulled out of mountaintop removal, but Barclays has increased its financing of the practice, closing £327 million in loan and bond transactions in 2013. Nick Dearden, director of the World Development Movement, said today: ""Coal is the most destructive fossil fuel, both for the climate and for the people who have to deal with coal mining on their doorsteps. Barclays must stop bankrolling dirty coal, at the very least pulling out of mountaintop removal and ending its relationship with the companies mining coal in the Borneo rainforest as a first step."" Notes to editorsImages of Thursday's protest will be available after the event from the World Development Movement.Paul Corbit Brown from the West Virginia organisation Keeper of the Mountains has travelled to London for the Barclays AGM and is available for interview.@wdmuk will tweet from inside the AGM.      "

The Hague ",Updated Dutch Fair Finance Guide finds big differences in banks' sustainability policies,,,,,,"
In 2013, seven Dutch banks have improved their sustainability policies regarding all told 16 subjects. This applies to ABN Amro, Aegon Bank, ASN Bank, NIBC, Rabobank, SNS Bank and Van Lanschot. Three banks, Delta Lloyd Bank, ING Bank and Triodos, have not introduced policy improvements in 2013, despite the fact that these banks do not yet have optimal sustainability policies, or none at all. This is revealed by the new annual update of the Fair Bank Guide.

 

'It's good that several banks are taking further steps to improve their sustainability policy. The race to the top is pushing forward, but not yet at high speed. There still is a long way to go. The policies of many banks, in particular with regard to climate change, animal welfare, taxation and corruption, and housing, still leave much to be desired. The importance of real sustainable investments has still to percolate through to all bank boards,' says Peter Ras, Fair Bank Guide project leader.

 

Positive though, are the new policies introduced by ASN and Rabobank on sustainability in housing and real estate by promoting energy saving measures. ABN Amro finds the extraction of oil from tar sands unacceptable. Aegon has improved its policy on manufacturing industries, by introducing certification requirements garments and chemical industries, and expects companies to accept chain responsibility when it invests in them. The differences between banks remain big: in the speed in which they adopt sustainability policies, in the level of their sustainability ambitions, and in the way they apply their sustainability policies in their investments.

 

'Our four studies into their practices in 2013 show that reality proves resilient to change. The investment policies of banks in nuclear arms, cattle transport, transparency and mining often fall short off the mark or are not being implemented,' according to Ras.


The new Annual Update Fair Bank Guide is published at www.eerlijkebankwijzer.nl.

Note for editors:

 

The Fair Bank Guide is an initiative of Oxfam Novib, FNV, Friends of the Earth Netherlands, Amnesty International, Animal Protection and Pax. The economic research agency Profundo does the studies.

 

The annual update published today concerns a research into the policies of banks. Alongside, we also periodically research the banks' application of their policies in practice. In the next research into their practices, September 2014, we will look into the possible involvement of banks into tax evasion.

San Francisco ",Report Finds Top Banks Moving Away From Coal: Citigroup and Barclays seen as laggards,Bank of America ,United States,Mountain top removal coal mining ,mining - coal ,United States,"
Today, Rainforest Action Network (RAN), Sierra Club and BankTrack released the fifth annual coal finance report card, ""Extreme Investments, Extreme Consequences"", which tracks the financiers of the worst-of-worst coal companies. The report shows that even as high-profile bankruptcies and costly environmental cleanup settlements illustrate the growing risks involved with lending to coal companies, U.S. banks provided $31 billion in financing for coal in 2013. The report ranks Citigroup as the top financier of the U.S. coal-fired power plant fleet with $6.5 billion in loans and underwriting, and Barclays as the lead financier of mountaintop removal (MTR) coal mining. Meanwhile, a positive trend is also developing as Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase both committed to end their financial relationships with major MTR coal mining companies; both achieved the highest grade in the report card's five-year history. Goldman Sachs also received recognition for stepping away from the contentious Gateway Pacific Coal Export Terminal proposal in the ecologically sensitive Puget Sound. Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and PNC Financial all received lower grades than in 2013 for their continued financing of MTR. ""The gap is widening between banks who have cut ties with extreme coal companies and those still holding on to those risky relationships,"" said Ben Collins, Campaigner for Rainforest Action Network's Energy and Finance Program ""Leading banks are beginning to plan for a carbon constrained future by moving away from companies that contaminate public water supplies, threaten our climate, and increasingly put shareholders at risk. At this point any company still banking on coal has its head in the sand."" This year, the report emphasizes the coal industry's impact on water contamination, including a case study investigating the ten lawsuits filed against Alpha Natural Resources for selenium pollution from MTR mines. Case studies in this year's report also expose coal industry bankruptcies and risky coal power plant transactions, including bankruptcies at MTR coal producers Patriot Coal and James River Coal, and sales of coal plants involving Dynegy in Illinois and Dominion Energy in Massachusetts. ""Mountaintop removal coal mining is destructive not only to the environment but to the economy and health of Appalachians as well,"" said Mark Kresowik, a policy analyst for the Beyond Coal Campaign at the Sierra Club. ""Over the last year financially prohibitive fines and settlements like those against Arch Coal and Alpha Natural Resources show that MTR is an awful investment for the American banking industry."" The report urges banks to plan for a carbon-constrained future. Specific recommendations include phasing out lending to producers of mountaintop removal coal and coal-fired power, withholding financing for new coal export terminals and ensuring that coal financing deals commit banks and companies to emissions reductions.

La Tejera, Rio Blanco, Honduras ",Indigenous groups in Honduras speak out against Dutch development bank FMO,FMO ,Netherlands,Agua Zarca hydro project ,energy plants - dams,Honduras,"
On April 1st 2014, members of the Indigenous Council, the
Elders Council, Patronato (Community Council), and other members of the
Indigenous Lenca community of La Tejera, Rio Blanco, Intibuca in Honduras issued a joint open
letter to Dutch development bank FMO, demanding that the bank will not provide
support to the Agua Zarca Hydroelectric Project.
The letter, issued at a festive event celebrating a year of indigenous resistance against the project, states that the planned dam project will
destroy the indigenous territory where the communities for centuries have grown
‘corn, beans, coffee, yucca, bananas, sugar cane, avocados, pineapple, oranges,
lemons, and other crops’. The letter further states that DESA (Desarrollos
Energéticos S.A., the project sponsor), will be ‘destroying the natural course of our
sacred Gualcarque River, which is the source of life and spirituality of the
Lenca people’ and that therefore they will ‘defend the land and the Gualcarque
River to be able to survive’.
The Agua Zarca dam, with a planned production capacity of 21,7 MW, is to be constructed in the Rio Blanco Lenca Indigenous territory, but has
been heavily contested ever since its inception in 2008. Apart from FMO, which provides a 15 million US$ loan, DESA is
to receive support from Finnfund of Finland and the Central American
Bank for Economic Integration, CABEI. Preparatory work is under way but until
now no construction has taken place on the dam itself.

Paris ","Société Générale is breaching its own standards in backing massive, risky Queensland coal project, study finds",Société Générale ,France,GVK ,energy plants - coal | mining - coal  | oil and gas,India,"
Société Générale's support for the huge Alpha Coal mining project does not comply with its own environmental and social principles (1). This is the conclusion of a study released today (2) by Friends of the Earth France that assesses the project's risks to biodiversity, water resources, the Great Barrier Reef and the climate. These risks should not be ignored and the project cannot continue as it is now, as the Land Court of Queensland confirmed on April 8th (3). Société Générale must withdraw its support immediately. Friends of the Earth has since September 2013 alerted Société Générale of risks connected with Alpha Coal (4), a huge mining project in the Galilee Basin in the state of Queensland in Australia. Today, the NGO publishes a comparative analysis (2) of the project's impacts and the principles adopted by the bank to ensure social and environmental responsibility. Biodiversity, critical habitats, water resources, the Great Barrier Reef, the climate: the study sifts through all project impacts and the verdict is clear: for Friends of the Earth, Société Générale must withdraw immediately from Alpha Coal if it is serious about its CSR commitments. ""The bank ensured us last November that it would only engage in Alpha Coal if the project meets its environmental and social principles, yet it is clear that the two are irreconcilable as project risks are enormous,"" says Lucie Pinson, private finance campaigner for Friends of the Earth. ""The Land Court of Queensland itself recognized early April (3) that the project could not be approved without considering the impact it would have on water resources on which people and farms in the region depend, and which also feed the Great Barrier Reef "" adds Derec Davies, from the local environmental association Coast and Country. The association, which challenged the authorization of the mining project together with local farmers, welcomes this victory, but now must await the decision of the Queensland Government, which could follow the recommendations of the Land Court, but is also free to ignore them and give a green light to Alpha Coal. The project would then become the first of nine mining projects in the Galilee Basin to obtain all necessary permissions. ""If the court's opinion is respected, the project should either be buried or provide additional studies on the use of water. However, the state of Queensland is known for mining (5) and the Minister Cripps could intervene on behalf of the company and approve the mine now,"" continues Derec Davies. ""The fact that the Land Court is in favour of the precautionary principle and is putting a halt to a project that was approved two years ago by the state of Queensland and the government of Australia also reveals major institutional failures in the bank's risk management. Also, the fact that environmental issues were not considered as they should have been from the start of project, particularly when they impact a World Heritage Site, jeopardizes the reputation of investors and their future profits. The fact that Blackrock, the largest fund manager in the world, is threatening to divest from companies involved in the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef, demonstrates an awareness and an unprecedented movement from investors. (6) We once again call on Société Générale to withdraw from this project, and we are now launching an international petition against the bank's support for fossil fuels,"" concluded Lucy Pinson (7). NOTES(1) Société Générale is a signatory to the Equator Principles and defined General Environmental and Social Principles to control the impacts of the activities it supports. These principles are set out in sector policies, including those on mining projects, as well as a cross-cutting policy on biodiversity, available on this page. (2) The study, ""Alpha Coal project & Société Générale's Environmental and Social General Guidelines"", is available in English at the bottom of this page.(3) The decision is available on this page. (4) More information on this page on the BankTrack website. (5) The governments of Queensland and Australia strongly support the mining industry and coal mining in Queensland, whatever the environmental, social and climate consequences. The Queensland Government has declared itself in favour of a simplified authorization procedures for coal projects, particularly with regard to environmental impacts in order to accelerate them. The Queensland Premier said in June 2012 that the state was ""in the coal business""; the Minister of the Environment and Heritage Protection Queensland also stated that environmental associations are extremists whose views should not be heard; and the Queensland Minister of the Environment himself even said he was not convinced that the emissions of greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans were causing climate change. Finally, members of the authority responsible for the protection of the Great Barrier Reef also have interests in the mining and gas industry.(6) Bloomberg article available on this page.(7) Petition in partnership with 350.org for the end of the support of coal by Société Générale and its immediate withdrawal from the Alpha Coal project, available In English on this page.     "

Nijmegen ",BankTrack calls for strengthening of Green Bond Principles,Bank of America ,United States,,,,"
The Green Bonds Principles, a new set of guidelines for issuers of green bonds signed by 13 commercial banks last January, need to be revised to include genuine commitments rather than broad recommendations, and must tackle the issue of what can and cannot be considered ‘green' head on, said the NGO network BankTrack in an open letter to the signatory banks published today.   The letter, co-signed by Friends of the Earth US, Rainforest Action Network, International Rivers,Amigos da Terra - Amazonia Brasileira, Global Witness and Berne Declaration, gave a cautious welcome to the release of the Principles, but stressed that the lack of clarity over what projects can be considered ""green"" risked setting the project up to fail. It also called for banks to match their commitment to growing the green bond market with an urgent move to curb fossil fuel financing in order to avoid dangerous climate change. The Green Bonds Principles were signed by 13 investment banks, led by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citi, Crédit Agricole, HSBC and JP Morgan, earlier this year. They include recommendations for improving the transparency of the rapidly growing market for green bonds - which can include any bond designed to raise money for environmentally beneficial purposes. BankTrack has called on the banks supporting this initiative to include real commitments to ensure high standards of transparency and disclosure for bond issuances they underwrite; reference clear and science-based definitions and criteria of what constitutes ‘green' under the Principles; and commit unambiguously to third party, independent verification of the information on sustainability and use of proceeds reported by Green Bond issuers. ""Banks increasingly accept that climate change is a real and urgent problem, and initiatives like the Green Bonds Principles do represent small steps in the right direction. However they lack credibility when adopting banks continue to provide unabated support for fossil fuel extraction and coal power projects, which even development banks like the World Bank have said they will no longer touch,"" said BankTrack director Johan Frijns. ""Furthermore, Principles which allow banks to decide for themselves what is and isn't ‘green' do not exactly inspire confidence. We'll need to watch the implementation of these Principles carefully to see whether banks meet the expectations they have established here"". "

Amsterdam/Brussels/Berlin ",European and US financial institutions continue to finance illegal palm oil,Deutsche Bank ,Germany,Bumitama ,agriculture - palm oil ,Indonesia,"
European and US banks and pension funds must stop financing illegal palm oil and deforestation, according to Friends of the Earth Europe. New findings show that Bumitama Agri, an Indonesian palm oil company and recipient of financial support from numerous European and US financiers, continues to clear land and run an illegal palm oil plantation in West Kalimantan, Indonesia, despite commitments to stop .Last year, Bumitama committed to stop clearing forests in its Ladang Sawit Mas (LSM) plantation, in response to civil society pressure  and complaints from the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). Friends of the Earth Europe's ‘Diary of destruction' presents satellite imagery that shows Bumitama continues to bulldoze land. Bumitama has also publicly admitted its Golden Youth (GY) plantation does not have legal permits in place - however, production is continuing, bringing illegal palm oil into the supply chain of buyers, including Wilmar International and IOI Corporation.Anne van Schaik, sustainable finance campaigner at Friends of the Earth Europe said: ""Bumitama isconsciously aiming to misinform investors, stakeholders and the public. Despite repeated promises, they continue to clear land, and produce palm oil on an illegal plantation.""European banks, including HSBC, Deutsche Bank and Rabobank, hold 4.56 million euro in shares and have given out 125.86 million euro in loans to Bumitama since 2010. Rabobank has engaged with Bumitama but so far without tangible results on the ground.Friends of the Earth Europe is calling on European banks and investors to immediately withhold all financial services from Bumitama and calling on global trader Wilmar International, a major buyer from Bumitama, to publicly terminate all contracts with the company.Anne van Schaik continued: ""The time for talk is over. Bumitama have shown they take neither their financiers, clients, nor their own promises seriously. Financiers in Europe and the US need to divest and halt their financial services to Bumitama. Palm oil traders, like Wilmar, need to publicly terminate contracts with Bumitama.""Cyber-actions in Germany and the Netherlands targeting Amundi, Deutsche Bank and Rabobank are ongoing .***NOTES: Bumitama's diary of destruction, March 2014:http://www.foeeurope.org/bumitama_diary_destruction_250314 Commodity Crimes:  Illicit land grabs, illegal palm oil, and endangered orangutans, Friends of the Earth Europe, November 2013: http://www.foeeurope.org/commodity-crimes-211113 Wilmar still needs to clean up its act: http://www.foeeurope.org/wilmar_clean_up_act_10022014 "

Melbourne and Sydney ",Westpac customers divest!,Westpac ,Australia,Great Barrier Reef Coal & Gas Exports ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,Australia,"
At city branches in Melbourne and Sydney today, dozens of Westpac customers turned out to close their accounts in protest over Westpac's multi-billion dollar support of the fossil fuel industry. Since 2008, Westpac has loaned close to $3 billion to the fossil fuel industry, including projects such as the Hazelwood coal power station, the Maules Creek Coal mine, and cal and gas export ports in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. Customers have been warning Westpac to stop lending to these dirty industries for months or they will move their money elsewhere. Today they made good on their word.
Check out the photos from today's action.
Westpac likes to make a lot of positive noises about sustainability but it stands in stark contrast to how they invest their (and their customers') money. Most recently, Westpac took on a leading role in providing finance for Indian conglomerate Adani so they can hold onto the Abbot Point coal export terminal in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. Use our interactive map to find more projects that Westpac and the other major banks have financed.
This is the final step on our way to a national day of divestment action on the 3rd of May. Market Forces and 350.org are encouraging anyone with a bank that is financing the dirty fossil fuel industry to join up and take part on what will be like today's Westpac activity but with hundreds of people around Australia, all at once!

Brussels ",Fear of change could precipitate demise of Europe’s energy giants,,,RWE ,energy plants - coal | energy plants - nuclear | mining - coal ,Germany,"
Europe's largest power companies are in trouble because of their reluctance to question dated business models in the face of far-reaching structural changes to Europe's energy market, according to a new report released today .
Gyorgy Dallos, Greenpeace International Senior Advisor, the author of the report: ""There is no question that today the EU utility sector is facing a paradigm shift which is stretching the energy giants' antiquated business models to breaking point. The largest utilities not only thought they could sail through the current turbulence by the usual lobbying and cost-cutting; they even actively contributed to their financial troubles. They expanded their capital expenditures after the 2007 financial crisis and built up large gas-coal overcapacities in a shrinking market, while letting control over renewables slip to others. These mistakes seriously throw into questions the power giants' ability to keep afloat in this fast-evolving energy market."" The report reveals the extent to which the EU's energy giants are weighed down by over-investments in gas and coal plants, while continuing to overlook lucrative opportunities in an expanding renewables sector. It shows how companies have made a poor show so far of adapting to new market realities - losing half a trillion euros in five years  - and builds the case for a fundamental shift in how they run their businesses.    Greenpeace EU energy & transport policy director Franziska Achterberg said: ""Europe's energy companies are wounded animals with bleeding profits and a gloomy outlook. So far, their response has been to vent their rage at renewables and lobby aggressively against any policies that help secure an energy transformation. But failure to adapt will only make it harder to defend their alpha-male status in an increasingly challenging environment that could spell their downfall.""
The Greenpeace report exposes for the first time that while the EU's top ten energy companies generate over half of all power within Europe (58 per cent), only four per cent of this is from renewable sources (excluding hydro power). Despite slowing demand, energy companies have added 85 gigawatts (GW) in fossil fuel power capacity in the last ten years - the equivalent of all of Germany's fossil fuel power plants. Analysts suggest that they need to shut down about 50 GW of fossil fuel capacity by 2017 if they want to maintain even their diminished 2012 profit levels .
Having missed the train of the renewables revolution, energy companies are now trying to derail it by putting pressure on EU governments to turn back. In the crucial debate on EU climate and energy policy for 2030 taking place right now, power utilities oppose targets to increase the share of renewables and reduce energy consumption. Power utilities attack renewable energy policies even though some companies, like Iberdrola, E.ON and Enel are estimated to have made a total of €4-5 billion in annual earnings from their renewables businesses . J.P. Morgan puts a much higher value on E.ON's renewables business than its conventional generation business .
Large power companies have no alternative but to redesign their strategies. European governments - often themselves major shareholders of these companies - have the responsibility to shepherd them towards new economically and environmentally sustainable business models. They should agree three binding 2030 targets for the EU to increase the share of renewables to 45 per cent, cut carbon emissions by at least 55 per cent and improve efficiency by 40 per cent.

Melbourne and Paris ",Australian and French banks target of protests on both sides of the world for investing in Australian coal projects,ANZ ,Australia,Great Barrier Reef Coal & Gas Exports ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,Australia,"
Environmental groups in Europe and Australia are planning actions that target major investors in Australian fossil fuel projects, as companies seek finance for new major coal mines this year.
In Australia, campaign groups Market Forces and 350.org have announced plans to shift hundreds of customers out of the ‘big four' Australian banks in protest over their roles as leading lenders to the fossil fuel industry. On the 3rd of May customers of ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, NAB and Westpac will be encouraged to ""divest"" in an effort to convince the major banks to avoid further loans to fossil fuels.
The role of major lenders to fossil fuels has been made clearer by the release of an online interactive map, showing which institutions have loaned the most to the fossil fuel industry in Australia since 2008. ANZ was top of the list, having loaned $6.5 billion to coal, gas and oil companies and projects since 2008. Commonwealth Bank was second ($5.0 billion loaned since 2008), and NAB third ($4.4 billion). Westpac, who recently won the most sustainable firm award in Davos, was seventh on the overall list, having loaned just under $3 billion.
The public action comes in response to recent approvals of coal projects, including ports that would dredge and dump 3 million tonnes of cubic metres of spoil in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area.
""Our governments have failed us, and now it's up to Australians to take action that ensures their money won't be used to fund these new dirty fossil fuel projects"", said Market Forces Lead Campaigner Julien Vincent.
Charlotte Wood, 350.org Australia Campaigns Director said ""In 2014, the fossil fuel industry will be fighting harder than ever to get a raft of new expansion projects off the ground - from Maules Creek mine in New South Wales's Leard State Forest to coal and gas ports on the Great Barrier Reef - they'll be turning to our banks to help them out"".
""If our banks won't divest from fossil fuels then it's time for us to divest from them and put our money into financial institutions who aren't funding community, climate and ecosystem devastation.""
""If history is any guide, the big four banks will be critical in determining the future of coal and gas projects that are currently on the table. This makes customers of the big four banks very powerful, and if they don't want their money helping to destroy the Reef and drive climate change, there's never been a better time to speak up"", said Mr Vincent.
Yann Louvel, Climate and Energy Campaign Coordinator with BankTrack international network said ""This information leaves banks nowhere to hide: their dodgy deals are out in public and communities on different sides of the planet are working to stop these sorts of dirty coal loans happening again"".
For instance, French bank Société Générale loaned AU$1.3 billion to fossil fuel projects and companies in Australia since 2008 and is assisting Indian conglomerate GVK look for finance for its recently approved Alpha Coal project, a 30 million tonne per year coal mine in the as yet untapped Galilee Basin region of Australia.
Friends of the Earth France Private Finance Campaigner Lucie Pinson said: ""In France, we are mobilising against Société Générale and its involvement in the Alpha Coal project in the Galilee Basin. The support of the French bank to such destructive projects on the other side of the world is not acceptable and we will keep opposing it, starting with a new national day of action on March 15"".

London ",Shell shareholders urged to force Arctic retreat - report,,,Royal Dutch Shell ,oil and gas,Netherlands,"
A new report released today warns investors of the risks to shareholder value from Royal Dutch Shell's Alaskan Arctic drilling programme. The report, ""Frozen Future: Shell's ongoing gamble in the US Arctic"" - is published by BankTrack members Greenpeace, Platform, and Pacific Environment, together with ShareAction, Oil Change International and Oceana.Operational failures, public pressure and legal challenges forced Shell to abandon its 2012, 2013 and 2014 US Arctic drilling programmes but the company still remains committed, at least publicly, to the region.Other oil majors - Statoil , Conoco-Philips and Total - have all stepped back from drilling for oil in US Arctic waters - largely at the project level - for reasons of cost, as well as regulatory uncertainty. Total has announced that it would not drill for oil at all in the Arctic Ocean due to the reputational risk of any spill in the region .Despite spending  over £5 billion in the US Arctic Ocean so far - a figure that dwarves the expenditure of other oil majors - Shell has failed to drill for oil there.. Shell's capital investment in 2013 is at a record high, while at the same time, the company has recorded a steep drop in profits.  Shell appears ready to ignore the economic, legal, operational, regulatory, reputational,  and environmental risks of the Arctic, all detailed in the report, in pursuit of highly uncertain returns.  ‘Frozen Future' argues that shareholders should analyse whether the high cost, high risk US Arctic Ocean represents an appropriate allocation of shareholder capital.The report explores a number of operational and economic risks facing Shell from offshore US Arctic drilling including:

the company acknowledges that only an oil find could make the project profitable, but US government  data suggests that Shell's prospect is a gas not an oil play;
A long-term, capital intensive project dependent on high oil prices beyond 2030;
inadequate oil spill response infrastructure in a remote region;
concerns over contractor management;
the lack of disclosure of Shell's estimate of and preparedness for the financial impacts of a worst case scenario spill;
ongoing litigation; and
regulatory uncertainty.

Frozen Future is available online at http://platformlondon.org/p-publications/shell-2014-investor-risk-chukchi/Doug Norlen, Policy Director at Pacific Environment said, ""BP has paid out over $38 billion after their Deepwater Horizon.  Yet, Shell is self-insured to only $1.15 billion per oil spill.  This means, in the likely event of an Arctic oil spill, Shell's shareholders will end up holding the bag."" Anna Galkina, researcher at Platform said, ""The recent court judgement following a lawsuit by Alaska Native and environmental groups was the latest setback in Shell's plans to drill in the US Arctic Ocean. It's highly doubtful that the many risks associated with this project are worth taking from an environmental, human rights, or financial point of view. Shell's shareholders should challenge the company's continued focus on this high risk project."" 
Louise Rouse, director of engagement at ShareAction said: “Shell is the biggest 
shareholding in almost every UK pension fund. As such savers in those pension 
funds are exposed to the potentially catastrophic consequences of a major spill 
in the US Arctic Ocean. As shareholders these pension funds have the opportunity 
to express their views on company strategy. As the new CEO, Ben Van Beurden, 
prepares to deliver his vision for the future of Shell on 13th March, 
shareholders should demand withdrawal from a high risk project that requires a 
highly capital-intensive investment for uncertain return.”
Charlie Kronick, senior climate 
advisor at Greenpeace UK said: “Now is a good time for Shell to change direction 
on the Arctic. There is a growing divide within the oil industry over the 
feasibility of Arctic Drilling, and other majors have walked away from what they 
now recognise was a bad bet.”

The Dutch development bank, FMO, together with the German Entrepreneurial Development Cooperation (DEG), has become the first European Development Finance Institution and the first Equator Principles Financial Institution to introduce an Independent Complaints Mechanism. 
Amnesty International, BankTrack, Both ENDS and SOMO engaged in the limited consultation process that was organized in the Netherlands by FMO, which led to this mechanism. There was no similar consultation in Germany, nor has DEG announced the availability of the Mechanism. 
While this mechanism is not perfect, it presents an important step in ensuring that project affected people can hold FMO accountable to its policies. As FMO has adopted the Equator Principles the establishment of FMO's Mechanism also sets an important precedent for other Equator Principle Financial Institutions, which so far have categorically refused to establish an accountability mechanism as part of the Equator Principles governance system.
We further support FMO's invitation to other European DFIs to join them in their commitment to redress any harm caused by their investments through the establishment of, or linking themselves to, this mechanism. 
Establishing a mechanism is one thing. The proof of the pudding, as always, is in the eating. Please get in touch with us if you or a community you work with has been adversely affected by a project financed by the FMO or DEG. We from our side will seek to ensure that the Mechanism gets tested and improved. We will keep pushing for greater public participation and transparency in future reviews of the Mechanism.
The attached briefing presents our view on the final outcome of this process. "

London ",EU takes historic step to stop banks betting on hunger,,,,,,"
EU negotiators last night agreed to introduce regulation to prevent speculation by banks and hedge funds driving up food prices and exacerbating the global hunger crisis. The new controls will place a limit on the number of food contracts that banks and other finance companies can hold, and will force traders to open their activity to greater public scrutiny.
Anti-poverty campaign group the World Development Movement has hailed the decision as an historic step forward, but said that the UK government's opposition to tough controls has resulted in serious loopholes in the regulation. In particular, limits will be set at national rather than EU level, which campaigners say risks a regulatory ‘race to the bottom' as countries could compete to set  weaker limits.
The group is urging the European regulator ESMA to ensure that the new rules are implemented effectively, and not watered down further by industry lobbying.
Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley together made an estimated £2.2 billion from speculating on food including wheat, maize and soy between 2010 and 2012. Speculation increases price volatility and has been a major factor in the sharp spikes in global food prices of the last six years.
Nick Dearden, director of the World Development Movement, said today:

""Public outrage over food speculation has been huge and the fact that the EU has listened to that anger is a victory for public pressure. But the UK's role in watering down the regulation has been a disgrace. The Treasury has put the profits of banks like Goldman Sachs above the basic human need for food, with the result that the new rules could be too weak to be effective. Yesterday's agreement is a good step forward, but now we need to make sure the limits are set at a level that properly tackles excessive speculation.""

The new rules on food speculation are part of a major piece of European financial reform, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID). Once it has been officially approved by MEPs and EU finance ministers, it must be incorporated into national legislation in each of the 28 EU member states. "

",Guilty as charged: World Bank-funded palm oil company accused of murder in Honduras,,,Bajo Aguan Valley Palm Oil Plantation ,agriculture - palm oil ,Honduras,"
About
 a year ago, in March 2013, Friends of the Earth and a coalition of 
allied groups requested that the World Bank cease its support for Grupo 
Dinant, a Honduran palm oil company implicated in dozens of murders as 
well as other human rights abuses. Our call to pull World Bank funding was based on years of evidence, some of which we cited in an article posted at the time, when we wrote: ""Dinant's oil palm plantations have 
been at the center of land conflicts dating back to the 1970s. Despite a
 long history of conflict, the International Finance Corporation paid the first of two $15 million loan installments to Grupo Dinant in November 2009 -- shortly after a military coup had ousted the democratically elected president. The coup was publicly supported by Grupo Dinant's CEO, Miguel Facusse.""
Given
 our work on the issue and our ongoing concern for what is essentially a
 war on peasants in the Aguan Valley and throughout Honduras, we are 
extremely pleased that an independent audit by the CAO Ombudsman of the International Finance Corporation last week issued what the New York Times called ""a stinging critique of the bank's private-sector arm over a 
loan to a Honduran palm-oil company engaged in a violent conflict with 
farm workers over land tenure.""
The UK Guardian echoed the sentiment: ""The verdict could not have been clearer: the World Bank's private lending arm failed to comply with its own ethical standards when it lent millions of dollars to a Honduran palm oil company accused of links to assassinations and forced evictions.""
The study concluded that the International Finance Corporation,
 which lends to companies in developing countries, failed to follow its 
own requirements when it first approved the 2009 loan to Corporación 
Dinant, and that its supervision afterward was inadequate.
Regarding the violence in the region, the
 CAO investigation states: ""According to civil society sources there 
were at least 102 killings of people affiliated with the peasant 
movement in the Bajo Aguán between January 2010 and May 2013, with 
specific allegations being made linking 40 of these to Dinant 
properties, Dinant security guards or its third party security 
contractor. Allegations in relation to the killing of at least 9 Dinant 
security personnel by affiliates of the peasant movement have also been 
made."" 
While we are pleased that the findings of the
 independent review match our own understanding of the situation in 
Honduras, we have yet to see the World Bank withdraw funding from the 
project. In its response, the IFC has rejected some of the CAO findings -- though it fails to specify which ones or provide evidence to support its rebuff.
Juan Almendarez, Director of Friends of the 
Earth Honduras (Movimiento Madre Tierra) said, ""We condemn the policies 
of the World Bank that have failed to avoid the human rights violations 
of poor farmers´ families and cooperatives in the Aguán Valley, and we 
consider the World Bank´s response to the result of the CAO audit to be 
unjust and inhuman.""
The Guardian article is worth quoting at length:

The audit, one of the most critical issued by the Bank's internal 
watchdog, was unequivocal. The IFC failed to spot the serious social, 
political and human rights context in which Dinant operates, or if it 
did, failed to act effectively on the information; and failed to 
disclose vital project information, consult with local communities, or 
to identify the project as a high-risk investment.
The CAO also said staff was incentivized ""to overlook, fail to 
articulate, or even conceal potential environmental, social and conflict
 risk."" They warned that such incentives could lead to, as indicated by 
the loan to Dinant, the IFC taking ""uninformed risks with serious 
consequences for people, the environment and/or the Bank Group's 
reputation."" 

The findings are shocking, but merely confirm what Friends of the 
Earth and other civil society groups have been pointing out for years: 
Miguel Facusse, the largest land-owner in Honduras, has been using money
 provided by the World Bank to grab land and wage a private war on 
peasants. But the findings also point to a larger concern -- the 
Honduras case is but one among infinite examples of global finance and 
multilateral ""development"" banks using the pretext of ‘poverty 
reduction' and ‘development' to marginalize, dispossess, and even murder
 those who fail to abide by the dictates of their economic program.
In a related advocacy effort in 2011, civil society groups shined the spotlight on Grupo Dinant's participation in the United Nations Clean Development Mechanism, eventually causing both the UK government and the French utility EDF Trading  to
 withdraw from the project, leaving Grupo Dinant without tradable carbon
 credits -- a major victory in a carbon market fraught with abuses.
Of course, there remains a long way to go for human rights in Honduras. Since the November 2013 Honduran elections -- widely recognized to have been marred by systematic fraud --
 the country continues to be wracked by state-sponsored violence. Under 
such conditions, where impunity is the rule rather than the exception, 
it is no surprise that the country's powerful elites literally get away 
with murder.
What is a surprise is that, with the release of the 
CAO-Ombudsman's report, the peasants of the lower Aguan Valley just 
might begin to see some justice.
UPDATE, January 17: A group of global and Honduran civil society groups are now calling on World Bank President Jim Yong Kim to take immediate action to withhold funding to Dinant,
 to require Dinant to halt all violence directed at local farmers, to 
find a peaceful and sustainable resolution to conflict over land, and to
 ensure that appropriate incentives are in place to secure IFC staff's 
adherence to its policies and procedures. To read the statement, click here. "

London ",Dutch pension giant divests from 5 Israeli banks,,,i illegal settlements ,Construction | transport and infrastructure,Israel,"
Dutch pension fund PGGM announced on the front page of its website today that it had withdrawn tens of millions of Euros worth of investments from five Israeli banks.
The fund cited the banks' unethical and illegal practices in the West Bank.
PGGM said in statement that it had been in discussions with Bank Hapoalim, Bank Leumi, the First International Bank of Israel, the Israel Discount Bank and Mizrahi Tefahot Bank for several years.
The fund had tried to convince them to reconsider their financial backing for Israel's West Bank settlements which ""are considered illegal under international humanitarian law"" - but to no avail.
PGGM said ""given the day-to-day reality and domestic legal framework they operate in, the banks have limited to no possibilities to end their involvement in the financing of settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories.""
This is a reference to 2011 Israeli legislation which outlawed any form of boycott, rendering it a legal tort - something punishable with potentially heavy fines.
PGGM manages the pensions of 2.5 million people and claims assets worth more than €153 billion ($208 billion). "

San Fransisco ",Goldman Sachs sacks coal terminal investment,Goldman Sachs ,United States,Gateway Pacific coal export terminal ,transport and infrastructure,United States,"
Today Goldman Sachs Infrastructure Partners sold off its remaining equity investment in Carrix, the parent company of Pacific International Terminals and SSA Marine that are behind a colossal coal export terminal proposal near Bellingham, Washington. The move comes after coal companies and their proponents have tabled or dropped three out of six proposed coal export terminals in the Pacific Northwest in the last two years.
If built, the Gateway Pacific Terminal at Cherry Point would mean up to 18 mile- long coal trains traveling through local communities and up to 48 million tons of coal exported to Asian markets each year.  It would be the largest coal export terminal in North America, and threatens to ruin the rich biodiversity and unique cultural legacy found in the region.
Amanda Starbuck, Energy and Finance Program Director at Rainforest Action Network commented:
""It is encouraging to see a major bank like Goldman Sachs taking a big step away from the coal industry by exiting the partnership behind the Gateway Pacific Terminal at Cherry Point. The bank's action sends a strong signal that if we are serious about protecting our environment from serious climate pollution, coal export terminals like the one at Cherry Point simply cannot be built.""
She continued: ""Goldman Sachs is taking a welcome step forward when it comes to walking their sustainability talk, offering more evidence that the financial sector is moving toward abandoning risky investments in the U.S. coal industry.
""Since 2011, Rainforest Action Network, along with ally organizations and thousands of concerned citizens, has been calling on Goldman Sachs to quit this coal export terminal. There are many reasons why a company concerned with its reputation would choose to avoid the egregious Gateway Pacific Terminal. This coal export terminal threatens human rights, a thriving Tribal fishery and biodiversity in a sensitive marine environment.""
Crina Hoyer, Executive Director of RE Sources for Sustainable Communities, which has strongly opposed the project, said: ""Goldman Sachs' stepping away from coal export is yet another sign from Wall Street that coal export is a losing investment.  We already know that local Main Street businesses would feel the negative impacts from coal export, and communities across the region are saying no to this bad deal because of health, climate, environmental and economic impacts.  We can do better than coal export both in Bellingham and the Northwest.""
Yann Louvel, Climate and energy coordinator of BankTrack, added: ""This move of Goldman Sachs is one in a string of decisions made recently by both public and private sector banks to retreat from the coal sector. Whether driven by concern for the disastrous climate impact of coal, or, as with Goldman Sachs, mere profit calculations, the coal industry will face ever more reluctant financiers in the years to come. Groups like us will continue to pressure banks to quit coal""

Laos ",Mekong Floods: The Dampening of the Wintery Suffering,,,Xayaburi dam ,energy plants - dams,Laos,"
It is the middle of winter in the Mekong region; however, throughout December, floods have brought havoc to communities along the Mekong River. From the Chiang Saen District, Chiang Rai province in Northern Thailand downward, the water level in the Mekong has risen rapidly. The flooding was most intense along the Thailand-Lao border from the Golden Triangle toward Khong Chiam, Ubonratchathani. It is unprecedented to experience such flooding in the Mekong during wintertime.
Flooding was particularly bad in Chiang Saen District around Sob Kok, the delta plain in the Kok River where it meets the Mekong. In just one morning, the flooding damaged a large plantation owned by local villagers. Water from the Mekong River suddenly spilled over the banks causing levels of water tens of centimeters high to flood the area; corn, tobacco, bean and other vegetables vanished in the blink of an eye.
On December 19, The Vientiane Times reported that construction on the Xayaburi Dam was halted as the Mekong River rose, flooding the site. The Xayaburi Power Company - owner of the US$3.5 billion hydropower project - announced that ""work on the dam's spillway had to stop when water flowed over the temporary barriers and lower parts of the area were submerged.""
It was later reported that by the morning of December 20, the flooding had reached the Chiang Khan District, Loei. In the midst of the chilled winter morning, a grandmother, her nieces and nephews and local villagers in Ban Pha Baen were all stunned to see their plantations of green onion swept away, and they could do nothing to stop it.
Villagers in Tambon Hor Kham, Bueng Kan Province, also found that the Mekong's water level rose greatly. They were dismayed to see their vegetable plantations vanish right before their eyes including lettuce, morning glory, green onion, tomato, etc. Some villagers made an attempt to harvest the remaining produce; uprooting tomato shoots from one place to another as vegetables were swept away by the current.
According to Jintana Kesornsombat, a villager from Tambon Hor Kham, Bueng Kan, apart from the produce that was washed away, their fishing gear and boats which were tied up on the river banks were also damaged, as no one had expected such a flood to happen. ""The floating water pumps belonging to villages and Tambon Administration Organizations were swept away in the Mekong as a result of the sudden high tide. The fishing boats suffered the same fate. The owners had to go out and look for their boats; otherwise they have to spend money to build new ones.""
Jintana also said that during the couple of days of high tide, the villagers were unable to go out to catch fish and so had lost their source of income. ""Villagers of most of the villages along the Mekong could not go out to fish. But since it has happened, we do not know who to complain to.""
The unprecedented flooding has left many wondering - are the rising water levels a result of heavy rainfall released by the dams upstream in China?
During the winter, the water normally gets lower and becomes quite clear and clean. For hundreds of years during this time of year, local villagers would grow vegetables on the banks of the Mekong River that are then teeming with rich sediments. Therefore it took them by surprise that such destructive floods would happen during this time of year.
Nevertheless, this is not the first time that floods have left a path of destruction in the Mekong. In August 2008, massive floods caused the inundation of houses along the river in Chiang Khong District, Chiang Rai, even though there was no downpour in the local area. Many were convinced that as a result of heavy rains in the north and in China, the dams upstream reached their full capacity and had to discharge water. Still, no warnings had been made to notify the villagers downstream.
After the flooding in 2008, the Chiang Khong Conservation Group followed up with the Mekong River Commission (MRC) who replied that ""a warning was already posted"" on their website. This time, according to the MRC website, the water level in Chiang Saen increased by seven meters on 17 December. Two days later, the water had risen by another two meters.
According to the MRC's preliminary analysis, the severe flooding which hit the Mekong River in December was due to unusually high rainfall in northern Lao PDR, northeastern Burma and southern Yunnan province in China. A statement on the MRC website says that ""there is no evidence at this time to suggest that the sudden peak was caused by release from dams in China."" 
However, such unprecedented flooding has lead to many questions about the management of dams along the Mekong, as well as the need for better warning systems in place for communities downstream. A pertinent question is how can communication among the six countries that share the Mekong River be improved regarding the management of the dams? When will this much-needed communication system be set up?
Five out of a series of eight dams have already been completed in the upper reach of the Mekong River in Yunnan, China. In addition, there are 11 more dams being planned in the lower reach of the river, the first of which will be the Xayaburi Dam in Laos. Currently under construction, 95% of the power generated by the Xayaburi Dam will be sold to Thailand. The second dam project - Don Sahong in Siphandone, Southern Laos - has been announced and preparations are being made prior to the start of construction.
The flooding water has made the small, marginalized people tearful, including the farmers growing vegetables and cotton, the fishers, and those growing rice along the Mekong. But who shall be held accountable for their agonies?
It is about time that a mechanism is developed to harness collaboration of people in the Mekong Basin based on the interest of local people.
The Precautionary Principle must be observed by the four member countries of MRC - Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam - and an earnest effort must be made to demand responsibility from the watershed country, namely, China.
Data concerning the water level in the Mekong, precipitation, and the amount of water stored in the five dams in China should be publicized along with other related metrological data, which may affect the downstream area. It is time that this information is made transparent and accessible to the public, in order to provide checks and balances and accountability to ensure that warnings be made prior to such disasters taking place.
The Mekong flood has come and gone but how will the damages be remedied? Precautionary measures have since been taken. But the Mekong flood has caused massive damage and still no permanent warning system exists, nor have the damages been adequately addressed. "

Amsterdam ",Taking Lobbying Public,ABN AMRO ,Netherlands,,,,"
This report by the Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (SOMO) looks at the transparency of lobbying by six Dutch banks - the four largest, covering around 80-90% of most Dutch banking markets, and two small ethical banks.SOMO ﬁnds that these banks are not as transparent in their lobbying activities as they claim to be. The report reveals that the banks are not making all the required information about their lobbying activities available - in spite of claims that they are reporting fully on these activities, in line with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines. This lack of transparency means that it is not possible to analyse the inﬂuence banks' lobbying efforts are having on public policies.This lack of transparency prevents an open and balanced debate about ﬁnancial regulation and increases the risk of regulatory capture - the process where policy-makers and supervisors defend the interest of the sector they are meant to regulate and supervise, even at the expense of the public interest. It thus affects the legitimacy of the policy- and decision-making process.In response to SOMO's ﬁndings, all six banks have recognised the importance of transparency in the ﬁeld of lobbying. Most have pledged to improve their transparency in future. The banks have also committed to implementing around half of the steps recommended by SOMO in the report, which also includes recommendations to the Dutch government and the Global Reporting Initiative.    Download whole publication:

London ",Santas deliver coal to ‘naughty bank’ HSBC,HSBC ,United Kingdom,,,,"
Twenty Santas delivered a tonne of coal on a dumper truck to ‘the world's naughty bank' HSBC at Moorgate in the City of London this morning to highlight the bank's massive financing of fossil fuels and to call on it to pull out of coal, the fuel most damaging to the global climate. Download free photos. Protestors from the World Development Movement, dressed as Santa Claus, delivered Christmas stockings full of coal to HSBC, and sung festive songs including ‘Frosty the Banker' and ‘Deck the Halls with Dirty Money'. HSBC underwrote more fossil fuel bonds and shares between 2010 and 2012 than any other UK bank, helping fossil fuel companies raise £75 billion. The bank finances coal mining by companies including global mining giants Anglo American, Glencore-Xstrata and BHP Billiton. It also finances oil and gas extraction worldwide. Nick Dearden, director of the World Development Movement, said today: ""HSBC has been a very naughty bank this year, pouring billions into dirty fossil fuels, and ignoring the fact that if we want to avoid runaway climate change, we have to keep fossil fuels in the ground. So we thought a tonne of coal would be the best Christmas present we could give the bank. Maybe it will be better behaved next year and start phasing out its financing of fossil fuels."" Notes to editorsDownload free photos of the event. HSBC has poured over £3 billion into Anglo American, Glencore-Xstrata and BHP Billiton, the companies behind the Cerrejón coal mine in Colombia. Cerrejón is Latin America's largest coal mine. It has swallowed up entire villages and is subject to fierce local opposition. If the coal remaining in this mine were to be burned it would create 13,000,000,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions - 184 times the annual emissions of Colombia. Yet most of the coal is destined for export, including to the UK. UK banks are the world's second biggest coal lenders after American banks. "

Beijing ",Chinese NGOs call for rejection of China Coal Bank,,,,,,"
51 Chinese environmental NGOs, including BankTrack members Greenovation Hub and Green Watershed, have sent an open appeal letter to the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC), calling upon the commission to reject the establishment of the China Coal bank.   Recently, there has been wide media coverage on the possible establishment of the China Coal Bank. According to the official website of the China Coal Bank,
 15 coal firms including Shanxi Coal International Energy Group and 
Jincheng Anthracite Group were led by JinBen Investment Enterprise to 
participate in establishing the bank, which will become the country's 
largest private bank and first resource-focused industry bank. The key 
objective of this bank will be to promote the development of the coal 
industry in China, optimize the coal chemical industry structure and support Chinese coal enterprises financingoverseas 
investments in coal.   The appeal letter points out that ""China Coal Bank is against national 
strategies on ecological civilization construction, energy conservation 
and emission reduction, atmospheric pollution prevention and control, as
 well as 'Green Credit Directives' Policies"". It also indicates that 
""the production and consumption of Coal is a main cause for 
environmental pollution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions"".   The 51 Chinese NGOs also indicate that establishing a resource-focused 
bank is not in accordance with the principal of optimizing financial 
resources allocation. As an industry under key national control, the 
coal industry is bound to reduce its production capacity. Enterprises 
with polluting or outdated technology will be eliminated and 
restructured. This brings enormous policy risks to the China Coal Bank. 
In addition, the China Coal Bank will use coal as the guarantee for 
deposit. This on one hand conflicts with the national public ownership 
of all coal resources, and on the other hand increases the bank's credit
 risk.   Once there is a break in the capital chain for coal enterprises, the 
bank is left with a large amount of problematic debts. This will lead to
 distortions of the coal price. Based on the inevitability of this price
 distortion due to opportunistic practices, coal enterprises may mine 
excessively in order to liquidate without any consequences. All of these
 could trigger immoral behaviors against market principle, while it will
 be extremely hard for regulators to monitor this risk.   The NGOs signing the letter therefore appeal to the China Banking 
Regulatory Commission (CBRC) and other relevant regulatory institutions 
to demonstrate their responsibility to the state and society and reject 
the proposal for the establishment of China Coal Bank by law.   Bai Yunwen, from Greenovation Hub, one of the co-signing NGOs, said: 
""Allowing private capital into the banking industry is an important part
 of financial reform and will promote the diversification of banking 
ownership structure and improve the overall efficiency of the financial 
markets. However, establishing a resource-focused China Coal Bank not 
only increases the difficulty to manage financial risks, it is also at 
odds with national development policies to address CO2 reduction and air pollution control.""   She continued: ""The establishment of the China Coal Bank would be in 
direct contradiction with recent policy moves of key international 
financial institutions. Global giants as the World Bank, European 
Investment Bank (EIB), the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (EBRD) and US EXIM Bank are all making moves to retreat from
 the sector. In addition, the United States, the United Kingdom and five
 Nordic countries have publicly announced that they will no longer 
support the construction of coal power plants abroad. China should 
follow suit."" "

Laos ",Science Takes a Backseat as Xayaburi Dam Continues,,,Xayaburi dam ,energy plants - dams,Laos,"
On Saturday leaders from Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Burma and Japan gathered in Tokyo for the Fifth Mekong-Japan Summit. The summit is part of a larger meeting between ASEAN countries to commemorate 40 years of friendly and cooperative ties between the nations. The summit also marks two years since an agreement between the Mekong governments to conduct further study on the sustainable development and management of the Mekong River, including the impacts of dams on the Lower Mekong River's mainstream. The Mekong River is a vital life source for the region; however plans to build a series of 11 dams on the lower mainstream continue to put the future of the Mekong in jeopardy, as the significant risks of these projects have yet to be fully understood.
The Mekong Council study (as it is commonly known) - which was discussed at the 3rd Japan-Mekong Summit in 2011 and confirmed one month later during the Mekong River Commission (MRC) Council meeting - was prompted by strong regional and international concerns over the transboundary impacts of the Xayaburi Dam, the first of 11 dams planned on the Mekong mainstream. Regional experts, as well as an independent review by the MRC, criticized the poor quality and limited studies presented in the project's environmental and social impact assessment report. During the MRC's ""prior consultation"" process, Cambodia, Vietnam and Thailand expressed their concerns about the transboundary impacts of the Xayaburi Dam. The Mekong Council study appeared to be a significant step forward in regional co-operation. It also demonstrated a recognition by regional leaders that there were (and are) significant knowledge gaps that hinder the full understanding the impacts of the cascade of dams planned on the Lower Mekong mainstream would have.
However, two years later we are no closer to seeing the results of this study or understanding the true impacts that the Xayaburi Dam - along with other proposed mainstream dams - will have on the Mekong River. The MRC Council Study has faced continued setbacks, leading to a significant delay in its implementation. Meanwhile construction on the Xayaburi Dam has continued and is now more than 13% complete, despite the fact that the project designs have not been finalized and made public.
Laos continues to claim that the Xayaburi Dam has been redesigned to address cross-border concerns and will become ""a world leading modern hydropower plant."" However, many questions remain unanswered about the design of the project and the viability of its proposed mitigation measures, including fish passage technology designed by Pöyry, the Finnish company whose role has contributed to much of the controversy surrounding Xayaburi, as well as the ""transparent"" sediment flow technology designed by French company Compagnie Nationale du Rhône.
The Xayaburi Dam threatens to block critical fish migration routes and destroy the Mekong's complex ecosystem which serves as an important fish habitat, supporting the lives and food security of millions.Fishery experts in the Mekong region have challenged the claim of the Lao government that the state-of-the art fish ladder, designed by Pöyry, will allow migrating fish to pass safely through the Xayaburi Dam. No technology currently exists to effectively mitigate the impacts caused by dams over 30 meters in height (Xayaburi will be 32 meters high). The Mekong River's mainstream is considered to be particularly challenging, if not all together impossible, due to the wide diversity of migrating fish species and the large quantity of fish that migrate at peak times. In its 2011 review of Pöyry's fish passage work, the MRC recommended that construction on Xayaburi be delayed at least two years so that fishery baseline data could be collected and incorporated into the final design. However, no delay has taken place and no final design has been revealed.
Similarly Laos continues to state - using a study carried out by project consultant Compagnie Nationale du Rhône (CNR) - that the Xayaburi Dam will be transparent, meaning that it will not cause any serious impediment in sediment flows to the Lower Mekong Delta. But even CNR has recognized that the plan to prevent the dam from trapping sediments is ""conceptual"" and that ""these solutions need to be developed and their costs evaluated."" CNR acknowledged that it only conducted a ""desk study,"" meaning that the report is based largely on theory that has never been used successfully in the Mekong Region. The company also admitted that the study lacks sufficient baseline data, including studies on sediment yield and sediment sources. This basic information is essential to design appropriate mitigation measures and even to understand whether mitigation measures could work in this context. In the case of the Xayaburi Dam, the project would block nutrients and sediment from travelling downstream to the Mekong Delta, jeoporadizing one of the region's most productive agricultural areas. 
Unfortunately the Don Sahong Dam - the second proposed mainstream dam - appears to be following the same treacherous path as Xayaburi, raising concerns amongst neighboring countries. As with the Xayaburi Dam, the Don Sahong Dam's Environmental Impact Assessment reveals critical gaps in understanding of the project's impacts on vital fish migration routes as well as the viability of proposed measures for mitigating these impacts. In September 2013, the government of Laos notified MRC countries of their intention to proceed with construction of the Don Sahong Dam, effectively bypassing the MRC process for prior consultation. Since then, the governments of Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam have submitted official letters requesting that the project undergo ""prior consultation,"" which allows the other countries to review proposed mainstream development projects with an aim to reach consensus on whether they should proceed. The MRC has yet to announce how this procedural dispute will be settled.
With many questions around the procedures for Don Sahong, focus on construction of the Xayaburi Dam - along with commitment to further study, such as the Mekong Council Study - appears to have been diverted. However, this weekend's summit is a reminder of the need for a commitment to regional cooperation in the Mekong. It is also a reminder of the many gaps that still remain in understanding the impact of dams on the Mekong mainstream. Just as the MRC's Strategic Environmental Assessment had earlier warned, the Mekong River should not continue to be used as a testing ground for hydropower technology. Instead, greater understanding and cooperation is needed to inform responsible, regional decision-making about the future of the Mekong. "

Melbourne ",Earth to Westpac: DIVEST!,Westpac ,Australia,,,,"
This is how to deliver an important letter! Westpac shareholders and staff at their annual general meeting in Melbourne were met with two huge banners, carrying the names of over three thousand people who have signed our open letter, calling on the bank to end fossil fuel investments.
The message couldn't have arrived at a more important time. After a week that saw the Federal Government approve a massive new coal export terminal anda gas liquefaction plant, both in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area, banks and other investors are all the more important as our last line of defence against these destructive projects.
The banners were large enough to bear the names of over three thousand people who have so far signed the letter, including sixty prominent community members who kick-started the project. One of the letter's earliest signatories, Felix Reibl of The Cat Empire, was there to help deliver the letter. He said:

Westpac calls itself an environmental leader - now is the time to prove it. With the Australian government approving massive new coal and gas projects in the Great Barrier Reef, it's vital that big banks fill this leadership void. Westpac needs to publicly declare that for the sake of the climate and for the health of the Great Barrier Reef it will not fund these destructive projects

Since 2008, Westpac has loaned well over $1 billion to coal and gas export ports along Australia's East Coast, many of them inside the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. These dirty coal and gas projects are driving more greenhouse gas emissions, pushing the Great Barrier Reef towards the World Heritage in Danger list and sustaining project inland that are threatening the health of Australia's land and water. While Westpac has announced some major new investments in renewable energy, Market Forces is calling on the bank to make this really count by at the same time, ending investments in projects that create more environmental destruction.
Market Forces' Lead Campaigner Julien Vincent said:

If Westpac wants to truly be a leader on environmental protection among Australia's big banks, they need to come out and commit to not funding more projects int he fossil fuel sector. There are massive new coal mines and gas plants planned that would make it virtually impossible to avoid runaway climate change - Westpac needs to recognise the line in the sand and side with environmental and climate protection.

Take action!

Click the link to sign Market Forces' open letter and, if you're a customer of the big four Australian banks, put your bank on notice and tel them that if they keep funding dirty coal and gas projects, you'll take your money elsewhere. "

London ",Credit Suisse ignored human rights commitments and became major shareholder in Vietnamese rubber giant 2 weeks after land grab scandal,Credit Suisse ,Switzerland,HAGL ,agriculture - non-food crops,Vietnam,"
Credit Suisse became the largest 
institutional shareholder in Vietnamese rubber giant Hoang Anh Gia Lai 
(HAGL) just two weeks after Global Witness exposed a range of 
environmental and human rights abuses in the company's plantations in 
Cambodia and Laos. Such action is in direct contravention of Credit 
Suisse's commitments to human rights, the campaign group revealed today 
(1). The disclosures come as another investor confirmed it had divested 
from HAGL as a result of the Global Witness findings (2).  
On 13th May 2013, Rubber Barons detailed
 how HAGL was routinely bulldozing local communities' land and clearing 
large areas of intact forest in Cambodia and Laos to make way for its 
plantations (3). The report also revealed how a range of investors 
including CBR Investments, Deutsche Bank and the International Finance 
Corporation (the private investment arm of the World Bank) held shares 
in HAGL. Swiss-based CBR Investments divested within days of the 
report's publication.
Christian Rosenow, CEO of CBR Investments Ltd, said to Global 
Witness: ""We managed a fund which had HAGL as one of its larger 
investments. After hearing reports of HAGL's actions in Cambodia and its
 failure to abide by environmental, social and corporate governance 
principles in Cambodia, we sold the entire position in HAGL. This took 
place within a few days of your report being made available.""
Despite extensive media coverage of the findings, on 28th May 2013 Credit Suisse swapped bonds it held in HAGL to acquire more 
than 10% of the company's shares - making it the second largest investor
 after HAGL founder and chairman, Doan Nguyen Duc (4).
""This is very worrying. Credit Suisse became a major shareholder in 
HAGL just when any responsible investor would be blacklisting them,"" 
said Megan MacInnes from Global Witness. ""What kind of checks can Credit
 Suisse have done if it thought this was a good time to provide finance 
to a company like HAGL?""
Global Witness contacted Credit Suisse in June 2013 and was told that
 the bank was legally obliged to keep HAGL's shares for a minimum of 12 
months. The bank subsequently confirmed that it had undertaken due 
diligence checks on HAGL's operations prior to purchasing the bonds, and
 that ""no specific concerns were identified at the time"". No further due diligence was carried out prior to the bond-for-share swap.
This contrasts starkly with Credit Suisse's position following 
previous exposures of its financing of human rights abuses in 2011, when
 it stated ""we pay particular attention to companies operating in 
industries where activities may, for example, infringe on the rights of 
local communities or indigenous peoples"" (5).
MacInnes added, ""Credit Suisse talks a good game, but it's actively 
enabling the land grabbing crisis that's sweeping across Cambodia and 
Laos by financing this company. The bank trades heavily on signing up to
 ethical initiatives like the UN Global Compact and the Equator 
Principles, so why is it profiting from the misery of those who've lost 
their land and forests to HAGL?""
Since August 2012, Global Witness has made repeated requests to HAGL 
to bring its operations in line with local law, resolve disputes with 
affected communities and publicly disclose details of its concessions. 
Despite making a range of commitments since the report was launched, 
Global Witness' consultations with villagers affected by the company's 
concessions indicate that very little has improved on the ground.
On 13th November 2013, HAGL refuted there was a lack of progress and described Global Witness' information as ""untrustworthy""(6).
Global Witness is calling for Credit Suisse to review its due 
diligence processes to ensure its investments fund fair and sustainable 
development models rather than land-grabs and deforestation.

Notes to editors:
(1)   Credit Suisse website says it adheres to the UN Global Compact, the International Bill of Human Rights and The Equator Principles: see here for more.
(2)   In an email to Global Witness dated 29 November 2013, a 
representative of CBR Investments Ltd stated: ""In April, we were given 
the mandate for another fund, which had HAGL as one of the largest 
investment positions. We advised the manager of the fund which engaged 
us as their Vietnam advisor that we recommend to exit that position, 
because we heard reports of their ESG sins in Cambodia. We sold their 
entire position within a few days of your report having been made 
available.""

(4)   Global Witness became aware of Credit Suisse's shareholder 
involvement in HAGL in June 2013. However, until now the organisation 
has been involved in a six-month period of direct engagement with HAGL 
to address the social and environmental problems associated with its 
concessions in Cambodia and Laos. As outlined in a statement issued by Global Witness on 14th November 2013, no significant improvements have been achieved on the 
ground and as a result the organisation recommended HAGL's investors 
divest.

(6)   When questioned by Global Witness on 13th November 2013, HAGL 
refuted the lack of progress made towards its commitments to change. The
 company stated it had provided jobs and implemented economic and social
 development projects (including building roads, houses and hospitals), 
but that the monsoon and Cambodia's national election had prevented the 
company from accessing affected communities. HAGL claimed that their 
moratorium on logging was being followed, describing the satellite 
evidence provided by Global Witness as ""untrustworthy"". In addition, 
HAGL says it is ""looking for an independent consulting firm to help HAGL
 make the survey and give advice to HAGL to improve the issues related 
to the communities"" but that such consultants must be accompanied by 
company staff in order to ""assure the consultant's independency of their
 findings"". "

Utrecht ",Leading financial institutions invest in producers of banned cluster bombs,,,,,,"
Worldwide, 139 private and public financial institutions continue to invest more than US$24 billion into producers of banned cluster munitions. The majority of these financial institutions are from the United States, South Korea and China. This is shown in the report Worldwide Investments in Cluster Munitions; a shared responsibility which IKV Pax Christi issues today.
The report is released today in Copenhagen to encourage Denmark and other governments to legislate against these kinds of explosive investments.Although the total amount invested has dropped from US$43 billion to US$24 billion since the last report in 2012, the number of financial institutions investing remains high. ""Cluster munitions cause unacceptable humanitarian harm amongst civilians. To continue to invest in producers of these banned weapons is ethically unacceptable. It is time for both governments and financial institutions to ban these explosive investments for good."" said Roos Boer, co-author of the report for IKV Pax Christi.Lockheed MartinThe US$19 billion drop since last year's report is due to the fact that Lockheed Martin stopped their involvement with production of cluster bomb components. Since the first report four years ago, three companies announced that they stopped production of (components of) cluster munitions: L-3 Communications (USA), Lockheed Martin (USA) and Roketsan (Turkey).24 billion US dollarIn the period 1 June 2010 to 31 August 2013, 139 financial institutions invested more than US$24 billion in the seven cluster munition producers researched in the report. They:

provided loans for at least US$2.3 billion;
provided investment banking services worth at least US$6.1 billion; and
owned or managed shares and bonds worth at least US$16.0 billion.

The report looks at financial investments into a short list of companies known for production of cluster munitions. These include: Alliant Techsystems (USA), China Aerospace Science and Technology (China), Hanwha (South Korea), Norinco (China), Poongsan (South Korea), Singapore Technologies Engineering (Singapore) and Textron (USA).Hall of ShameThe report's 'Hall of Shame' contains 139 financial institutions based in thirteen different countries that invest in cluster munition producers. Most (67) are from the United States, followed by South Korea (23) and China (19). None of these countries have joined the Convention on Cluster Munitions. Also of concern, the report demonstrates that there are 22 financial institutions from countries which have joined the convention that still invest in cluster munition producers (Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Switzerland and the United Kingdom).IndiscriminatelyLike landmines, cluster munitions are banned under international law because they kill indiscriminately. The 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) categorically bans the use, production, transfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions. To date, 113 countries have joined the CCM of which 84 have ratified the convention.The press release that was issued today can be found here.  The full report and additional documents are available here.

Kunming ",New report measures green credit footprint of Chinese banks,,,,,,"
Kunming based Green Watershed today
releases the English summary of its newest report on the Green credit
footprints of Chinese Banks, published last month in China.
The organization reporting on banks is the first of its kind in China. The
newest report makes an assessment of Chinese Banks and their social and
environmental responsibilities. The report is based on tracking and monitoring
the implementation of environmental responsible banking by 16 Chinese listed
banks over the last five years (2008-2013).
The recently announced reform by the new Chinese leaders, is aiming to
achieve the ambitious objective of ecological civilization. To contribute to
ecological civilization banks must play their part by investing in a social and
environmental responsible way. The report shows that many improvements can be
made in this respect.
This requires for the Chinese government to step up its regulation and
supervision of the banking sector. However, the government is considering a
deregulation of the banking sector. This means that civil society organizations
have to play an even bigger part in monitoring and assessing the banks'
performance of their social and environmental responsibility, than they already
do.
Xiaogang Yu, director of Green Watershed, sees it as major gain for the
environment that China
has witnessed important progress in green credit in recent years. More and more
banks are working on institutional innovations while already existing policies
have been improved.
The research findings however show that banks to a different degree work
with social and environmental policies. Unfortunately, in the case of most
banks implementation is lacking. For some banks it is found that they merely
repeat the government's policy and slogans, and that their green credit policy
and measures are basically conceptual instead of concrete rules. Some banks
highlight the green measures they take, but remain silent on their continuing
loans to highly polluting sectors. Most Chinese banks also fail to meet
international standards on information disclosure.
More-over, for many banks there is no information available at all on
whether they address the green credit directive: so far no assessment has been
made of the smaller and medium-sized banks in China,
nor of the major policy banks as China Development Bank and China EXIM Bank and
foreign banks like Citicorp, which holds several local offices in China.
The Green credit policies originally aimed at
diverting bank investments in China
away from heavy polluting sectors and projects into a more green direction.
Since 2007, when China's
State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA), the People's Bank of China and
the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) jointly issued their China Green
Credit Policy, the pressure on the policy level made the Chinese banking sector
acknowledge its environmental responsibility. Some banks do better care than
others though.

Berlin ","Untaxed, unregulated, unpunished: multinationals making multi-billion dollar profits at the expense of human rights",,,,,,"
The NGO Campaign, Facing Finance, presents their latest report, DIRTY PROFITS 2, to commemorate International Human Rights Day, (10.12.) in Berlin. This report demonstrates that human rights violations, corruption, exploitation, and environmental destruction remain ingrained in the business models of major multinational corporations. The robust, 124-page report presents the most serious violations of international norms and standards committed by 26 multinational companies, (including SHELL, GAZPROM, GLENCORE, NESTLÉ and ADIDAS). The companies examined in this report grossed more than 1.24 trillion Euros in 2012 and earned profits in excess of 90 billion Euros.
""A not insignificant portion of multinational profits are derived, now as much as ever, from openly controversial practices that violate people and the environment,"" laments Thomas Küchenmeister, coordinator and initiator of the Facing Finance Campaign. He goes on to criticize the inadequacy of international tax laws, saying, ""The fact that multinationals are also circumventing tax laws adds to the unjustness, despite the practice being largely legal."" According to the European Commission, the EU loses around 1 trillion Euros every year due to tax evasion and/or avoidance maneuvers.
Based on financial analyses conducted by the economic research consultants at Profundo, the DIRTY PROFITS report reveals the European financial institutions that financially support such controversial operations. Many companies, like Gazprom, Shell, Nestlé, and GlencoreXstrata, depend on financial support from financial institutions for their controversial projects. Between 2011 and 2013, financial institutions invested nearly 33 billion Euros into the 26 companies analyzed in the DIRTY PROFITS 2 report. Through their financial transactions with these companies, (e.g. providing loans, assisting in share/bond issuances, etc.) financial institutions take on responsibility for the environmental and social consequences of their clients' actions. Overall, BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse contributed the most towards controversial companies; they support the vast majority of controversial companies that other internationally accredited investors, (e.g. the European Investment Bank, and the Norwegian Pension Fund), have chosen to exclude (17 of the 26 analyzed companies) from their investment portfolios due to their severe environmental/social impacts.
""Through their noncritical financial injections towards polluters and human rights violators such as Gazprom or Glencore, financial institutions support the illegal plundering of resources, human rights abuses, and global warming,"" said Barbara Happe from the human rights and environmental organization, urgewald. This demonstrates that the voluntary commitments adopted by financial institutions fail to safeguard environmentally and socially unsustainable investments.
Recently, international attention has focused on the Russian energy giant, Gazprom, which has a reputation for corruption and anti-competitive practices. The Russian coast guard arrested several Greenpeace activists this summer during a peaceful demonstration against Arctic oil drilling at the Prirazlomnaya oil platform. The activists were detained for more than two months before they were eligible for release on bail. They currently stand charged of hooliganism. Investments in Gazprom by European banks, led by BNP Paribas, ING, Unicredit, Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, totaled ¤3.4 billion during the investigation period.
Dirty Profits 2 calls on financial institutions to incorporate international human rights and environmental standards into binding financial service regulations that exert influence on companies to comply with these standards.
Furthermore, lawmakers must immediately take steps to end the financing of controversial sectors, (e.g., nuclear weapons and cluster munitions). Also, tax benefits for pension (""Riester"") funds, should be limited to financial products that meet sustainability standards. Certification of such retirement, or ""Riester,"" products, needs to be monitored by an ethics committee; civil society further calls on bank customers to scrutinize their bank's business practices and, if necessary, change their financial service provider.

Sydney ",Adani’s US$7bn Australian coal project unviable,,,Carmichael coal mine project ,mining - coal  | transport and infrastructure,Australia,"
A new report released today by US-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) - Remote Prospects: A financial analysis of Adani's coal gamble in Australia's Galilee Basin - warns investors the controversial 60 million tonne per annum Carmichael coal mine and infrastructure project is uncommercial.
Report co-author, IEEFA's Tom Sanzillo, former first deputy comptroller of New York said, ""Our conclusion is that Carmichael presents a picture of unacceptable risk. It's a high cost coal product in a low cost market in structural decline. The project is uneconomic by any measure,"" said Mr Sanzillo.
""This project is on the wrong side of the coal boom. It might have been viable 5 years ago but the market has moved on. Adani bought in at the peak of the coal cycle but failed to predict the structural decline of coal,"" Mr Sanzillo said.
""Adani is now overextended with unrealistically ambitious expansion plans, has no successful history of coal mining, has lost share value in critical segments, and is over-leveraged, with $US12bn of debt against external market capitalization of $US5.17bn. It is in not in a strong position to complete this project.""
Adani Enterprises is proposing to develop the 60 million tonne per annum thermal coal mine complex in the remote Galilee Coal Basin, central Queensland, Australia; construct 500km of rail infrastructure across agricultural land and floodplains to the coast; and develop a highly contentious coal export terminal through the iconic, UNESCO World Heritage listed Great Barrier Reef.
Key findings of the report include:

The estimated cost of production of A$87/t (energy adjusted) is likely to be above the global thermal coal price for the foreseeable future, rendering the project uneconomic.
Adani is in a weak financial position to execute such an ambitious project: with external equity market capitalization at only US$5.17bn against estimated net debt of $12bn, development costs for the Carmichael and Abbot Point T0 coal terminal projects are estimated at US$10bn.
Adani has over-estimated coal quality while under-estimating costs and project complexities.
At peak production of 60 million tonnes per annum, Adani's Carmichael mine would be by far the largest coal mine in Australia in a remote inland region with no power, rail, water or workforce infrastructure. Prior to 2013, Adani's only other experience in coal mining is a 2-4mtpa coal mine in Indonesia that has consistently performed below expectations.
The project is plagued by delays that continue to squeeze the Adani Group's cash flow, with the company conceding the 2014 timetable for commencement of production has been pushed out to 2016, but more likely 2017 with full production beyond 2022.

 
Report co-author Tim Buckley, independent financial analyst said, ""Our analysis shows a systemic problem with the financial viability of coal mining in the Galilee Basin. Adani may have thought they were buying a coal mine, but it is increasingly likely that they have inadvertently bought themselves the world's most expensive cattle station.""
""The Queensland government's recent announcement of a royalty holiday for the first movers in the exploitation of Galilee coal signals to the market that these high-cost greenfield projects in Queensland are unviable from an investment perspective.""
Erland Howden, Energy Campaigner Greenpeace Australia Pacific, which commissioned the report, said, ""It is clear that the Carmichael project, if developed, will be an environmental and climate disaster. This report shows that the project is also uneconomic."" "

Washington / Jakarta ","From Main Street to Wall Street,  US banks and brands support illegal forest destruction for palm oil",Bank of America ,United States,Bumitama ,agriculture - palm oil ,Indonesia,"
Illegal and destructive production of palm oil in
Indonesia is continuing, with a chain of culpability that spreads worldwide, from
Southeast Asian rainforests to supermarket shelves and Wall Street board rooms,
reveals a new report released today by Friends of the Earth, Forest Heroes, and SumOfUs (1).
In recent years, consumers have been
shocked to learn that many household food brands use palm oil from sources
engaged in widespread destruction of tropical forests. The new report, Commodity
Crimes: Illicit Land Grabs, Illegal Palm Oil and Endangered Orangutans, shows
how this forest destruction not only harms forest peoples, endangered species
and the Earth's climate, but is often illegal. The report names the major U.S.
and European banks that are financing these unlawful land grabs and the
investors who are profiting.
Commodity
Crimes: Illicit Land Grabs, Illegal Palm Oil and Endangered Orangutans, documents how one Indonesian company, Bumitama Agri Ltd, engaged in
systematic forest destruction in and around forest reserves and in 2012 sold
itself in a public offering that admitted to including illegally cleared tracts
of forest. The financial maneuvers of Bumitama Agri - a leading supplier to the
global market, including to Wilmar International, the world's largest palm oil
trader - also raise questions about possible violations of Indonesian's law
against money laundering.
The report used on-the-ground
investigation, global commodity trade data and satellite mapping to document
that two companies affiliated with Bumitama have systematically violated
Indonesian law, the guidelines of the industry-sponsored Roundtable on
Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and the sustainability policies of international
finance institutions by illegally clearing thousands of acres of forests and
fragile peatlands that are home to some of the world's greatest biodiversity,
including critically endangered orangutans. 
The report is accompanied by a short video providing graphic testimony
to the destruction.
The report traces a chain of culpability
that stretches the length of the palm oil supply chain:

From
     local district officials in Indonesia;
Through
     global palm oil traders IOI Corp. and Wilmar International;
To
     financiers like Bank of America and Citigroup; and investors including
     pension plans like the California Public Employees Retirement System
     (CalPERS) and TIAA-CREF;
To
     companies selling a wide variety of products to consumers on grocery and
     drugstore shelves. 

""Most consumers of packaged foods
don't know that they are contributing to the illegal destruction of rainforests,""
said Jeff Conant, International Forests Campaigner at Friends of the Earth.
""But financiers who invest in palm oil - with full knowledge of the
industry's corrupt and rapacious way of doing business - have no such excuse.""
""We call on all financiers of Bumitama, Wilmar and IOI to pressure these companies to clean
up their acts, or to withdraw their financing,"" said Conant.
Commodity
Crimes puts the spotlight on Bumitama Agri for its
unlawful forest destruction. But the case also serves to illustrate how poor
regulations and complicated transfers of land and assets allow palm companies
and commodity traders to take control of land, regardless of its legal status,
traditional use or ecological importance. The Environmental, Social and
Governance policies that many financiers have adopted are insufficient to
contain the abuses in the palm oil sector, the report argues.
""Companies are often quick to hide the
destructive origins of their palm oil by citing complicated supply chains and
muddled regulatory landscapes, while hiding behind greenwashing certification
systems like RSPO,"" said Rob Wohl, Campaigner with SumOfUs.org. ""But companies
like Nestlé, Ferrero Rocher and Unilever have shown that it is feasible to
eliminate deforestation and exploitation from products and implement fully
traceable supply chains. Companies should stop forcing consumers to choose
between their brands and the world's rainforests.""
Indonesia's forest destruction, much of it
for palm oil, makes it the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases after the
United States and China. The country established a moratorium on new forest
clearing in 2010 and extended it earlier this year, but the rule has been
widely criticized for poor implementation.
""The government of Indonesia should
immediately show that they are serious about protecting communities' rights and
saving the remaining forests,"" said Zenzi Suhadi,
Forest and Plantation Campaign Manager at Walhi
(Friends of the Earth Indonesia).""They should stop issuing new permits
to palm oil companies, evaluate existing permits and prosecute violations.
Indonesia's much-heralded moratorium on new plantations is a commitment to the
whole world. But to achieve real forest protection, it needs to be implemented
with consistency.""

(1) Friends of the Earth International is a global network
representing more than two million activists in 74 different countries. Commodity Crimes is co-released in Europe by
Friends of the Earth Europe and Indonesia and in the US by Friends
of the Earth US and Indonesia, Forest Heroes, and SumofUs.
The report has also been published by Friends of the Earth Europe in a European version. "

Edinburgh ",Over 100 organisations call for an end to biodiversity offsetting plans,,,,,,"
Today, at the opening of the World Forum on
Natural Capital in Edinburgh, 140 organisations from all over the world are releasing a statement to say ‘No to biodiversity offsetting'. The statement was launched in a counter forum on Natural Commons taking place in Edinburgh at the same time.
Biodiversity
offsetting is the theory that you can destroy nature in one place, as long as
you replace it elsewhere to ensure ""no net biodiversity loss"". Not only has
this proven unworkable, it puts pressure on community livelihoods. Hannah Mowat
from FERN explains why offsetting has had such poor results so far:   ""Offsetting
treats nature such as forests or rivers as if it were an exchangeable item you
buy in the supermarket. Destroying one forest or river with a promise of
protecting another fails to recognise that they are part of a wider ecosystem and
intrinsic to human and cultural landscapes. Destruction of complex and site
specific biodiversity cannot be offset. It is time to be clear that offsetting will
not tackle biodiversity loss but may impoverish communities.""
The statement
raises concern that offsetting could erode the power of environmental laws to
restrict damaging activities. In the UK, offsetting is being used as an excuse
to speed up planning laws and remove ‘green tape'. The EU is also considering new laws that could question the strength of the
Nature Directives. This is also the case in a number of countries in the global South, such as
Brazil, where it is a license to trash:
""In Brazil, the government is reforming public
policies to allow companies to ‘offset' their impact rather than preventing
damage in the first place. The Brazilian development bank, BNDES, provides
grants to states to create subnational laws for carbon and biodiversity
offsets. Though this is being challenged by the public attorney, these policies
are causing dramatic violations of Indigenous Peoples' rights and the rights of
communities dependent on natural resources"" said Lúcia Ortiz from Friends
of the Earth Brazil.
Nick Dearden,
director of the World Development Movement and co-organiser of the Forum on
Natural Commons said: ""Nature is a
common good that we all share rights to and have responsibility over. It should
be managed democratically by a commons-centred approach and not by a market
based approach that takes power away from the people and gives more resources
to those who can pay the most. Many organisations, scientists and people have
come together through this statement to expose that the motive is profit, not
conservation.""
Climate
justice activists currently at the climate negotiations in Warsaw are exposing
that market based mechanisms such as carbon trading and forest carbon markets
are proven failures and should not be extended to areas such as biodiversity. They are calling on governments to bring these failed approaches to an end and
concentrate on ways to reduce carbon emissions and biodiversity loss at home.

Warsaw ",Banking on Coal – Undermining our Climate,,,,,,"
Coal is the single greatest source of carbon emissions endangering our climate. Yet never before has so much coal been mined on the planet as today. Since 2000, global coal production has grown by 70% and has now reached a staggering 7.9 billion tons annually. And what's more, the industry is still expanding. Who on earth is financing the enormous production increases of the world's dirtiest fossil fuel?
The study ""Banking on Coal,"" published by the German environmental NGO urgewald, the Polish Green Network, the international NGO network BankTrack and the CEE Bankwatch Network answers this question. From 2005 to mid-2013, 89 commercial banks poured a total of 118 billion euro into the coal mining industry. The lion's share of finance - 71% - was, however, provided by only 20 banks. Together, these banks financed enormous coal mine expansions around the world.
The three banks at top of the list are Citi (€7.29 billion), Morgan Stanley (€7.23 billion) and Bank of America (€6.56 billion). Also among the top 20 are Swiss, German, Chinese, British, French and Japanese banks. The authors investigated commercial lending to and investment banking services for 70 coal mining companies, which collectively account for 52% of global coal production. ""The report is based on months of research,"" explains Heffa Schücking, director of urgewald. ""While most banks publish figures on their annual investments in renewables, they don't really want to talk about the coal dust spilling out of their portfolios.""
The authors also analyzed their data according to the banks' countries of origin and found that financial institutions from only three countries - the US, UK and China - collectively account for 57% of coal mining finance. ""It's mind-boggling,"" says Schücking, ""to see that less than two dozen banks from a handful of countries are putting us on a highway to hell when it comes to climate change. Big banks already showed that they can mess up the real economy. Now we're seeing that they can also push our climate over the brink.""
The research also shows that coal finance has increased tremendously over the past few years. Since 2005 - the year the Kyoto Protocol came into force - banks' financing for coal mining companies increased by 397%. ""This is a real danger,"" says Kuba Gogolewski, of the CEE Bankwatch Network. ""While policymakers are far too slow to regulate the mining and burning of coal, banks are speeding ahead with investments that are totally inconsistent with a stabilized climate.""
The report also contrasts the investments of the top 20 banks with their own statements and policies on climate change. Yann Louvel of BankTrack, who analyzed these policies, comments: ""It's as if banks have a split personality disorder."" He points out that Bank of America claims to be ""financing a low carbon economy""; Credit Suisse ""cares for climate"" and BNP Paribas thinks it is ""combatting climate change."" Louvel says: ""Banks finally need to face up to the real-world impacts of their financing decisions. When they finance companies that blow up mountaintops or destroy jungles to extract coal, they have a responsibility for these impacts.""
The ""Banking on Coal"" report also examines the ""hot spots"" of global coal production and the vastly destructive impacts that coal mining is having on India's last tiger forests, on indigenous communities in Colombia or on scarce water resources in South Africa. For each of the global ""hot spots"" of coal production, the report uncovers which financial institutions have played the lead role in financing the expansion of the industry.
Central Europe is one of the coal hot spots featured in the report, as Germany and Poland are among the world's major lignite producers. Together they account for almost 25% of the world's lignite production. ""Poland, which is hosting the UN climate talks, relies heavily on coal, harming communities across the country. Private sector banks should help it transition to a cleaner economy instead of bankrolling strip mining and air pollution,"" says Anna Drążkiewicz of the Polish Green Network.
Yann Louvel of BankTrack concludes: ""Banks must stop undermining our future by financing yesterday's fuel. We want them to quit coal and we want them to do it now.""
The report is a sequel to the study ""Bankrolling Climate Change"" published in 2011 at COP17 in Durban, which examined banks' involvement in the entire coal industry, from coal mining to energy generation. This report focuses on the coal mining industry, but digs deeper to uncover the banks behind the mines.

London ",Five banks made £2.2 billion from food speculation in 2010-2012,Barclays ,United Kingdom,,,,"
Five banks made 
an estimated total of £2.2 billion from speculating on food including wheat, 
maize and soy between 2010 and 2012, prompting campaigners to accuse the banks 
of fuelling a global hunger crisis.Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Deutsche 
Bank, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley were the top five global investment banks 
involved in global commodity markets between 2010 and 2012, making an estimated 
£640 million ($1 billion) from speculating on food in 2012 alone. Financial 
speculation fuels price spikes, pushing food prices beyond the reach of millions 
of people.The figures were released today by anti-poverty campaign group 
the World 
Development Movement, which is calling for tough controls to curb food 
speculation. Proposed new regulation is due to be discussed at the European 
Union on Wednesday (6 November), but is at risk of being watered down 
by objections from the UK 
government and heavy lobbying by the financial sector.Nick 
Dearden, director of the World Development Movement, said today: ""Our figures 
show that despite the efforts of some banks to distance themselves from this 
unethical practice, the big players continue to make vast returns from food 
speculation. Much-needed regulation to curb food speculation is on the table - 
but is at risk of being dangerously weakened by opposition from the UK 
government.""EU negotiators are to meet on Wednesday to try to agree a 
final text on the regulation of financial speculation on food and other 
commodities.Download

Adelaide ",Commonwealth Bank customers across Australia divest!,Commonwealth Bank ,Australia,,,,"
One hundred Commonwealth Bank customers turned out at branches across Australia on the 1st and 2nd of November to close their accounts in protest at the bank's investments in the fossil fuel industry. Divestment actions at Brisbane, Byron Bay, Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne and Perth saw customers turn out and collectively close their accounts, sending a message that if Commonwealth Bank chooses fossil fuels, its customers are going to choose another bank.
It's the second time in as many weeks that customers of the big banks have collectively divested. On the 26th of October, ANZ customers in Melbourne closed their accounts, taking $2 million in savings with them and making a priceless statement to the bank. This weekend was another step forward in the fossil fuel divestment campaign in Australia, which has so far seen customers accounting for over $50 million in savings warn their bank that unless loans to cal and gas stop, they take their money elsewhere.
As Mark Doyle, (former) Commonwealth Bank customer from Brisbane said:

""I was horrified to learn that Commonwealth Bank was so heavily invested in activities that are damaging the Great Barrier Reef and increasing greenhouse gas emissions. The sooner I could take my money out the better, and I can't think of a more effective way to tell the bank that they're not going to fund environmental destruction with my money.""

The actions took place just days before the Commonwealth Bank AGM in Adelaide on the 8th of November. Market Forces and 350.org are planning to attend the AGM, showing shareholders of Commonwealth Bank how their investments in fossil fuels are risking the bank's reputation as well as its balance sheet.
Take action! Shareholders of Commonwealth Bank can join the call for management to disclose the bank's exposure to the coal and gas sector, and detail plans for how it will divest from the fossil fuel industry. Click here to send an email to management.

Melbourne ",ANZ customers divest in Melbourne!,ANZ ,Australia,,,,"
On Saturday, 26 October 2013, a groundbreaking event happened for the fossil fuel divestment campaign in Australia. Nearly 30 ANZ customers collectively walked in to the Bourke Street Mall branch of the bank and closed their accounts in protest over ANZ's financing of the coal and gas industries.
Customers had been warning that if ANZ - already Australia's biggest lender to dirty coal and gas exports - continued to fund the fossil fuel industry, they would take their money elsewhere. ANZ kept on supporting fossil fuels and this was the first sign that the customers would make good on their word. After symbolically cutting up their cards, the customers lined up and, one by one, closed their accounts, handing over a letter to make sure ANZ knew exactly why they were leaving.

On the day, about $2 million in savings and other financial products was shifted out of ANZ. But the real value of the day was the powerful message sent to the bank that if they keep choosing fossil fuels, their customers will choose another bank.
Since the start of $2008, the big four banks (ANZ, Commonwealth, NAB and Westpac) have invested about $6.5 billion in coal and gas export projects along Australia's East Coast - many of them inside the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. This year, hundreds of customers of the big four banks have put their bank on notice, warning that unless loans to coal and gas projects stop, they'll move to another bank.     "

Brussels ",Fairfin launches petition to split the banks,,,,,,"
Together with our partners RFA (sister 
organization in French speaking Belgium) and the Roosevelt Collective (a citizen 
movement), Fairfin has launched a petition calling for a strict separation of 
banks in Belgium.
We have 
been waiting for five years for fundamental change in the financial sector, as 
was promised in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis. Recently the Belgian 
government has announced a new banking law, incorporating a separation of banks, 
bringing hope on this front. Unfortunately, we have many reasons to believe that 
the proposal will be weak, the weak regulations in France and Germany among 
them. We really need to avoid a half-hearted separation, tailored by the 
financial lobby. That is why we need to do more than waiting 
helplessly.
Last year 
Fairfin investigated the extent to which the Belgian banking sector was involved in 
the real economy. We found that the risky business models from before the crisis were 
still intact. Some banks still have huge trading portfolios, seeking short-term 
profits. In good times this generates major profits for the industry, including 
nice bonuses and booming stock markets. However, if the gambling goes wrong, 
society pays the price.
This is 
exactly why Fairfin shoulders this campaign: banks should be separated to prevent risky 
trading activities being guaranteed by tax payers.
A strict 
separation is necessary for the following three reasons:
-      
It reduces the 
size and complexity of universal banks and their inherent systemic 
risk
-      
It reduces the 
costs of tax payers in the event of a bank failure
-      
It prevents 
risky trading activities being guaranteed by tax payers
Together 
with our partners, we are aiming for 100,000 signatures to boost political 
pressure in Belgium for effective regulation.
We have 
been collaborating on this theme with Finance Watch, which runs an European 
campaign on sustainable finance. Their (technical) assistance proved to be 
vital.

Paris ",Société Générale: International mobilization against Alpha Coal Project,Société Générale ,France,,,,"
Two days after one of the biggest meetings of the coal industry took place in Berlin , les Amis de la Terre (Friends of the Earth France) and their partners have sent an open letter  to Société Générale, calling upon the bank to abandon its plans to finance the huge Alpha Coal mining project in Australia. Located in the southern end of the Galilee Basin - an area as yet untapped by mining - the project would have disastrous impacts on the local environment, the climate and the Great Barrier Reef. The open letter, signed by 57 organizations of 17 countries, calls on Société Générale to immediately and publicly step down from this project, and for a civil society mobilisation to begin against the project during November.
Société Générale is currently conducting the due diligence work for the EUR11 billion Alpha Coal mining and export project in Queensland. The Project will include development of mines, a railway and port expansion, and will extract 30 million tonnes of coal annually for export to Asian markets including India and China.
The mine, consisting of six separate open-cut pits, would have huge impacts, as explained by Derec Davies, a spokesperson for the Coast and Country Association of Queensland : ""The mining lease covers over 60,000 hectares; 47km of waterways would be diverted and the surrounding groundwater would be drastically lowered. The whole local economy, mainly based on farming, as well as the critical habitats of protected species would be severely affected.""
The project would also heavily harm the Great Barrier Reef, one of the world's richest ecosystems. The United Nations World Heritage Committee has asked that the Australian government ""not permit any new port development or associated infrastructure outside of the existing and long-established major port areas within or adjoining the property, and to ensure that development is not permitted if it would impact individually or cumulatively on the Outstanding Universal Value of the  property."" Yet under the proposed expansion, the port at Abbot Point would become the biggest coal port in the world.
The greatest threat to the Great Barrier Reef comes from climate change. Over its 30-year lifespan, the mining operations and coal burning from Alpha will result in 1.8 billion tonnnes of CO2 emissions . But, as the first of a series of planned projects in the Galilee Basin, it could also play a key role in the opening up of the region, magnifying the carbon impact of the Alpha project many times over. Indeed, these projects would emit almost as much carbon annually as the whole of Germany , and their exploitation is consistent with scenarios that would lead to six degrees of global warning above pre-industrial levels .
In support of local farmers and the Coast and Country Association of Queensland - which opposes the approval of the Alpha Coal Project - les Amis de la Terre denounce the leading role played by Société Générale. With 57 organizations from 17 countries, the association calls the bank to follow the example of the US bank Citi, which has ceased providing advisory services on this project.
""With this letter, we want to send a strong message to Société Générale but also to other international banks that may be considering support for such projects: the Galilee Basin is a no-go zone! Whatever the nationality of the bank, international civil society will be there to remind them of their commitment in terms of social, environmental and climate responsibility"" say Lucie Pinson, private finance campaigner at les Amis de la Terre, France.
Delays can be very damaging to such costly projects and can lead to their end. Therefore, les Amis de la Terre call on all of civil society to mobilize from the 12th to the 15th of November. The general public can already put pressure on Société Générale by voting in the Pinocchio Prize, for which the Bank is nominated for its involvement with Alpha Coal.

London ",Campaigners tell HSBC: Pull out of coal,HSBC ,United Kingdom,Cerrejón coal mine ,mining - coal ,Colombia,"
Campaigners delivered a box of coal to HSBC's 
Canary Wharf headquarters this morning, with a message calling on the bank to 
pull out of financing the global coal industry. The campaigners from the World Development Movement, 
wearing hardhats, set up a 'climate crime scene' outside the bank using hazard 
tape.The 
UK's biggest bank, HSBC is also the UK's biggest underwriter of fossil fuel bonds and 
shares. Between 2010 and 2012, HSBC helped 
fossil fuel companies raise £75 billion, double the figures mustered by either 
Barclays or RBS. As well as oil and gas investments, the bank facilitates the 
coal mining industry through its support for companies including global mining 
giants Anglo American, Xstrata and BHP Billiton.Indonesian activist Hendrik Siregar, campaigner against 
coal mining in Indonesian Borneo financed by banks including HSBC, joined the 
protestThe World Development 
Movement warns that coal investments are currently fuelling a 'carbon bubble' in 
which banks are investing in fossil fuel reserves which cannot be burnt without 
breaking international climate change commitments. The group says that a sudden 
correction of the current overvaluation of fossil fuel companies could cause a 
new global financial crisis.World 
Development Movement campaigner Officer Kirsty Wright said: ""HSBC claims to be reducing its 
CO2 emissions, but the bank is only referring to a small proportion of its true 
emissions - for instance the electricity is uses in its offices. It doesn't 
consider any carbon emissions which come from bankrolling fossil fuel 
firms.""In fact, HSBC pours billions 
of pounds a year into yesterday's resources - threatening both climate and 
financial ruin.""Burning coal not 
only gives off more carbon emissions than any other fuel, but mining coal leads 
to massive displacement and pollution across the world. The Cerrejón coal mine 
in Colombia has seen the eviction of whole villages from their land and 
threatened the only reliable water supply in the region. HSBC provides financial 
support to the three multinationals involved in the 
project"".The World Development 
Movement is calling on HSBC to disinvest from coal projects and companies, as 
well as taking steps towards eliminating its involvement in the oil and gas 
industry. It is also calling on the UK government to regulate the banking system 
away from its dependency on carbon intensive industry.Read the World Development Movement's briefing HSBC and fossil fuel finance. "

Tucson, Arizona ",Save the Scenic Santa Rita releases Investor Update on Augusta Resource Corporation,,,Rosemont Copper Mine ,mining - non coal,United States,"
Today, Save the Scenic Santa Ritas (SSSR), a non-profit environmental organization comprised of ranchers, small business owners and community members opposing the proposed massive Rosemont open-pit copper mine released an Investor Update on Augusta Resource. This Investor Update can be accessed here.Augusta Resource, a junior Canadian mining company, is seeking through its Rosemont Copper subsidiary, permits to build a massive open-pit copper mine on 4,000 acres in the Santa Rita Mountains on the Coronado National Forest just south of Tucson.This Investor Update provides current and potential investors with essential information that the company may not have provided in its investor relations efforts. It is not intended to provide investment advice, but rather to share critical information upon which to base future decisions.The Investor Update describes important actions concerning Augusta's proposal, provides an overview of the company and the questionable background of key officers, and identifies unresolved regulatory issues that could block approval of the mine.  The information in the update is robustly sourced having been derived from regulatory records, Augusta Resource's financial filings, and technical reports and various media accounts.The proposed mine would have devastating impacts on Southern Arizona's water, air, wildlife and economy and there is unprecedented opposition. Political, business, tribal and environmental leaders have joined with citizens from all walks of life to oppose this project. Their opposition is based on its impacts to the quality of life and economy of both current and futureSouthern Arizona residents and businesses.Because of its devastating impacts on the Santa Rita Mountains and threats to regional water resources, BankTrack, a global network that tracks the environmental impacts of the financial sector is closely following the proposed Rosemont Copper mine.

Nijmegen ",BankTrack welcomes Thun Group paper on banks and human rights,Barclays ,United Kingdom,,,,"
Seven leading international banks, informally grouped together as the 
‘Thun Group of Banks', last week presented a discussion paper for banks 
on the implementation of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human
 Rights.
BankTrack welcomes the 
discussion paper as a significant step towards recognising the relevance
 of human rights to banks' core business, but regrets that the Thun 
Group has not addressed all relevant areas of the UN Guiding Principles.
 As such, it calls on the banking sector to finally recognise its 
responsibility to provide adequate complaint and remedy mechanisms to 
people suffering human rights abuses as a result of bank-financed 
activities.  This discussion paper from the Thun Group - which now includes 
Barclays, BBVA, Credit Suisse, ING Bank, RBS Group, UBS AG and UniCredit
 - is the result of two years of deliberations, and follows the 
universal adoption of the UN Guiding Principles by the Human Rights 
Council in 2011.  The paper significantly recognizes that the UN Guiding Principles apply
 to all parts of a bank's business, including asset management and 
personal banking as well as corporate and investment banking.  It also 
makes an important contribution as a guide to the banking sector for 
operationalizing the UN Principles, elaborating on policy and governance
 frameworks for banks, and providing guidance on the scope and content 
of due diligence procedures for different financial services.  Andreas Missbach of the Swiss NGO Berne Declaration, which launched the
 banksandhumanrights.ch website in 2010 to lobby Swiss banks to improve 
their human rights policy and practice, said: ""We welcome the fact 
that the banks for the first time recognize the relevance of human 
rights in their core business, and are therefore discussing the 
necessary adjustments to their due diligence processes. It is now 
crucial that this discussion document translates into real 
implementation, with transparent reporting on progress.""  Access to remedy missing  However, the paper is disappointingly limited in its scope, focusing 
only on Principles 16-21 as ""those which are most relevant to banks' 
potential adverse impacts on human rights and tend to be most 
challenging to implement"". No explanation is given as to why the 
paper omits principles clearly directed towards businesses, including 
those in section 3 of the Principles, ‘Access to Remedy'. The paper 
ignores principles calling on companies (including banks) to ""establish 
or participate in effective operational-level grievance mechanisms for 
individuals and communities who may be adversely impacted"", and to 
""provide for or cooperate in"" remediation where they have caused or 
contributed to human rights abuses (Principles 22 and 29).  ""The discussion of financial institution responsibility to respect 
human rights is a welcome and necessary development. However, the 
discussion is empty without inclusion of the responsibility to ensure 
access to remedy,"" said Komala Ramachandra at Accountability Counsel, 
which assists communities around the world to defend their environmental
 and human rights. ""Transparent, effective, and legitimate avenues for 
addressing and remediating human rights violations, are critical to 
building a meaningful system to avoid and address risks discussed in the
 paper,""  ""BankTrack has long called for banks to establish mechanisms that would
 allow rights holders whose rights are violated by bank clients or bank 
financed projects access to remedy with the banks themselves"", said 
Johan Frijns, BankTrack coordinator. ""The Thun group seems to have 
deliberately left this crucial part of the human rights obligations of 
banks out of the discussion paper, a huge missed chance to assist banks 
in moving forward on this long neglected obligation.""
ENDS  The statement and paper by the Thun Group of Banks can be found on the www.business-humanrights.org website.
In December 2013, BankTrack expanded on its criticisms of the Thun Group discussion paper in a more detailed response paper, here.

London ",HSBC shuts down City branch in face of climate protest,HSBC ,United Kingdom,,,,"
HSBC shut its flagship branch in the City of London today in the face of protests against its investment in fossil fuels. HSBC is the UK's largest underwriter of fossil fuels bonds and shares.
The protestors from the World Development Movement dressed as coal miners and cordoned off the area outside the bank using ‘climate crime scene' hazard tape and eviction notices.
The protest took place to kick-start a global month of action against dirty energy. During the next four weeks there will be protests throughout the City of London and across the country targeting HSBC and other financial institutions for their financing of fossil fuels.
World Development Movement activist Kirsty Wright said:
""We set up an extraction zone outside HSBC to bring the reality of what the banks are financing back to the City. By pouring billions of pounds worth of finance into fossil fuels each year, HSBC is destroying people's homes, lives and the climate. For example, HSBC is financing companies mining coal in Indonesia, which are pushing people off their land and polluting their water. HSBC must stop this reckless investment.""
The activists also attempted to hand in a giant cheque for seven pence, to represent the amount of compensation people in Indonesian Borneo have been offered for land taken for coal mining by  BHP Billiton, which has raised over £1.8 billion since 2009 from bonds underwritten by HSBC.

London ",UK banks financing coal boom destroying Borneo rainforests,Barclays ,United Kingdom,Kaltim Prima Coal mine ,mining - coal ,Indonesia,"
According to a new report released today the top 5 UK banks (HSBC, Barclays, Standard Chartered, RBS and Lloyds)  through their financing of an Indonesian coal boom are complicit in fuelling climate change and destroying communities and the environment in the rainforests of Indonesian Borneo.
UK banks have lent more money for Indonesian coal than banks from any other country since 2009, while Standard Chartered, the UK's second biggest bank, has lent more than any other bank in the world. 83 per cent of coal produced in Indonesia's top coal province on the island of Borneo is mined by companies part-financed by UK banks .
The report by the World Development Movement follows the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's landmark assessment of the state of the world's climate, and comes on the first day of new rules requiring all UK companies to make their carbon emissions public . Campaigners say the UK rules will let banks off the hook by failing to include emissions from fossil fuel projects they finance.
Standard Chartered loaned US$1 billion (£640 million) to Indonesian company Borneo Lumbung in 2012 . Borneo Lumbung's coal mine has polluted the river that the people of Maruwei village rely on .
Yesmaida, a woman from Maruwei, told the World Development Movement: ""The river is now dark and dirty. Sometimes when we wash, it feels itchy.  More importantly, we can't drink the water anymore. The water used to be clean and clear, not like it is now.""
Barclays has loaned £127 million to Bumi Resources , owner of Indonesia's biggest coal mine . Bumi Resources is 29 per cent owned by the disgraced London-listed company Bumi plc created by Nat Rothschild. Its Kaltim Prima Coal project has resulted in many people losing their land, with one indigenous village, Segading, having been displaced three times .
Gagay, leader of the Dayak Basap tribe in Segading, told the World Development Movement: ""The Dayak Basap tribe depend on the forest but the company destroys it. We used to be hunters in the forest. We cannot hunt any more but we cannot work for the company either as we don't have enough education.""
London-listed mining giant BHP Billiton has received a total of £6.3 billion since 2009 from Barclays, Standard Chartered, RBS and Lloyds, and as it is a FTSE 100 company, almost every pension fund in the UK invests in it. BHP Billiton plans to open coal mines across a vast area of Borneo threatening to destroy large areas of rainforest on which indigenous people depend .
The World Development Movement is calling for rules to stop UK banks and pension funds bankrolling climate change and creating a carbon bubble which threatens to cause a new financial crisis .
Alex Scrivener, campaigner at the World Development Movement, said today: ""The coal boom is leaving a trail of destruction across Indonesian Borneo, wrecking the rainforest and wrecking people's lives. Here as in so many fossil fuel projects across the world, the invisible hand of UK finance is at work. We have to stop our banks pouring billions into dirty energy that fuels climate change and ruins local people's environments and livelihoods. And we have to stop destructive fossil fuel companies accessing UK investors' money by listing on the London Stock Exchange.""
The top five UK banks HSBC, Barclays, Standard Chartered, RBS and Lloyds underwrote bonds and shares in fossil fuel companies worth £170 billion between 2010 and 2012 . The London Stock Exchange holds more coal reserves than any other stock exchange, and total fossil fuel shares worth £900 billion , giving dirty coal, oil and gas companies access to money from UK pension funds and investors. The value of shares in renewable energy companies on the exchange is only £5 billion, or 0.56 per cent of the value of fossil fuel shares .
The World Development Movement is calling for the new carbon reporting rules to force banks and pension funds to report the carbon emissions from the fossil fuel extraction they finance, and for regulation requiring them to make public details of their fossil fuel investments. The campaign group is also calling on the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to reform the listing criteria for the London Stock Exchange so that companies with poor social, environmental and climate records are unable to list.

Mumbai ",Smoke and mirrors: World’s largest coal company hiding truth about reserves,,,,,,"
Research by Greenpeace has found that the world's largest coal producer, Coal India Limited, is misleading potential shareholders by concealing the true level of its extractable reserves, as it prepares to sell additional shares to international investors.
According to the analysis, ""Coal India: Running on Empty?""(1), the company has failed to disclose to stock exchanges an internal assessment that shows its extractable coal reserves are 16% less than stated at the time of its 2010 listing - a violation of Indian stock exchange rules. Coal India continues to claim via its website that it has 21.7 billion tonnes of extractable coal reserves, yet a review of its own internal documents undertaken by Greenpeace and the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) has shown that the company has only 18.2 billion tonnes of extractable coal, as per the United Nations reserve classification system (2). At targeted production rates, these reserves could be exhausted in 17 years.
Greenpeace India has filed an official complaint with the Indian Stock Exchange regulator against Coal India for concealing material evidence on the scale of their coal reserves, in contravention of the terms of the Listing Agreement under the Indian Securities Contracts Regulations Act, 1956.
Coal India has contracted four of the world's largest banks, Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse, to push its new share offer to international investors. In light of this evidence, these banks have a moral and legal responsibility to ensure that material facts relating to the company's reserves are disclosed to investors.
The banks engaged in this new share option and the executives of Coal India should be aware that over reporting of reserves can have significant consequences. In 2004, when oil giant Shell deliberately overestimated its reserves by around 15%, significant investor anger led to a restructuring of the company, the departure of the chairman and two other senior executives, and a series of high profile and expensive legal cases.
Commenting on the findings, Ashish Fernandes of Greenpeace said: ""Coal India is trying to pull the wool over the eyes of its present and future shareholders by hiding the fact that its extractable reserves are almost a fifth less than it claims. Coal India has a legal duty to tell the truth and they are failing to do that.""
""The big banks whose reputations are already tarnished following the 2008 banking crisis should be wary of getting into bed with Coal India, which is hiding the true nature of its reserves. This might be another opportunity for these four banks to turn a quick profit, but it is a recipe for disaster for potential investors in Coal India.""
The findings of the disparity between what Coal India claims are their reserves and what the reserves actually are will have a significant impact on the Indian Government's coal power expansion plans. India plans to add over 100,000 MW of new coal fired power by 2017, even though it is struggling to fuel existing coal power plants. The government's model has been designed on the basis of what they have been told are the available coal reserves. This shortfall in the availability of domestic coal will either scupper expansion plans for new coal fired power stations or increase reliance on costlier imported coal. Coal and oil imports have been blamed for India's ballooning Current Account Deficit.
""If Coal India wants international investors, it must learn to play by international investment rules. A conflicted coal reserve estimate creates a misleading impression of company value"", said Tom Sanzillo, Director of Finance for the U.S. based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

Brussels ",The anniversary of broken promises,,,,,,"
5 years 
after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, and the beginning of the worst 
economic crisis in decades, the EU has not delivered on promises of 
strong regulation of the financial sector. A swift overhaul is needed. 
Together with other organisations (full list at the end), BankTrack has signed
 the statement below. 
The 15th of September marks the fifth anniversary of the most spectacular bankruptcy in the financial crisis of 2007-2008. On that day, renowned Wall Street investment bank Lehman 
Brothers filed for bankruptcy due to disastrous investments in US real 
estate through financial products. At the time, European leaders made bold promises to reform financial regulation in the EU ""to respond to crises, but 
also to avoid them in the future"", Commission President Barroso said. 
Five years on, the results are woefully insufficient.
The financial crisis led to a devastating economic crisis in Europe. Unemployment
 in the EU has increased steadily to a record level of nearly 26 million
 - a staggering 10.7% of the labour force with youth unemployment much 
higher. It also set the euro crisis in motion which has resulted in 
painful austerity measures in almost all EU countries and hundreds of 
billions of euros in expensive bailouts of banks that made bad loans in 
the first place. Having paid such a high price, European citizens have 
every right to demand effective action from politicians to protect us 
from a repeat of this meltdown. But after five years of financial ‘reform' in the EU, the return on our investment is woefully inadequate.
The evidence is clear: European banks continue to be undercapitalised, and EU banking regulation continues to allow banks - such as Deutsche Bank and Barclays - to borrow even more than Lehman Brothers did before it crashed1; derivatives markets continue to grow and now stand at a value much higher than five years ago2; few toxic financial instruments have been banned, not even the complicated securities that played a key role in the crisis.
One key reason for this failure is the success of the financial lobby to keep effective regulation at bay. The financial industry is spending millions to influence decision makers, and scaremongering is their standard argument: they claim that regulating finance would be
 costly to society in terms of unemployment. However, this is an absurd 
argument if one looks at the costs of the crisis in 2008, regarding bank
 bail outs and millions of people losing their jobs.
Financial corporations have enjoyed uninterrupted privileged access to decision makers, for instance in the debate on new rules on banking and on derivatives. As pointed out repeatedly by the Alliance for Lobbying Transparency and Ethics Regulation in the EU (ALTER-EU)
 and others, advisory groups of the Commission and the Council were, and
 are still, dominated by representatives from big financial 
corporations. A group recently set up to advice the EU on measures to 
stop tax evasion is full with representatives of the same accountancy 
industry that is so instrumental in advising companies how they can 
minimize their tax payments.
In order to start a genuine reform of the financial sector, a number of first steps are needed:

A new, democratic approach to financial reform, including effective measures to curb the influence of the financial lobby in Brussels, by overhauling finance industry led advisory groups and 
closing the revolving door between government and the finance industry 
An immediate and structural revamp of the reform agenda of the financial sector to ensure this dreadful bitter financial and economic crisis leads to strong regulation and democratic control of the financial sector so that it is at the service of society and finances social and 
environmentally sound activities. The urgent first steps to that end 
include the introduction of a genuine Financial Transaction Tax (FTT), 
higher financial buffers for banks, the break-up of banks that are too 
big to fail, reduction of the importance of the financial sector in the 
economy, ending speculative activities such as speculation in food. 
Swift and effective measures to stop tax evasion.
 According to the Commissions own figures, this would bring 1.000 
billion euro a year, which would be more than enough to cover for the 
current austerity measures.
Introduce measures that would make those in the financial sector responsible for scandals, misleading of clients, fraud and criminal activities 
personally liable. It is not acceptable that, in case of scandals such 
as Libor or HSBC's involvement in money laundering, banks make a 
financial settlement while the ones responsible walk away without 
punishment. Banks should never be ‘too big to jail'.

The five years of financial reform turned out to be a major disappointment. To citizens and citizens groups, that means regulation
 of the financial sector has to be on the political agenda for years to 
come, including at the European elections next year, to ensure the reforms that would make a real difference are introduced.

Nijmegen ",“Sustainable” badge for Bank of America stretches credibility of Dow Jones Sustainability Index,ANZ ,Australia,Coal  ,mining - coal ,India,"
S&P Dow Jones Indexes and RobecoSAM have revealed that Bank of America is to be added to its long-running Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI), a major reference point for sustainable investors. The move comes just as campaigners around the world are urging the bank to rethink its decision to underwrite a major share offer for Coal India, a company whose recent record includes the destruction of tiger habitats, the use of child labour and the forcible displacement of forest communities (1).
Bank of America is the largest company by market capitalization to be added to the DJSI World index in the recent review. The Index aims to identify ""the world's largest companies that lead the field in terms of corporate sustainability"" (2). However, Bank of America is about to act as a merchant broker for the $1 billion sale of shares in Coal India, the world's largest coal miner. Greenpeace and Rainforest Action Network (RAN) are currently mobilizing their members to lobby Bank of America to change its mind.
Far from being an isolated incident of unsustainable behaviour from the US bank, research by RAN indicates that the bank is the largest funder of the coal industry in the US - one of the biggest threats to public health and climate stability. It has invested more than $8.84 billion in coal in the past two years, including financing environmentally devastating mountaintop removal coal mining (3).
""The decision to place Bank of America in a Sustainability Index at this time is shocking, and shows DJSI's claim to represent ""the gold standard for corporate sustainability"" to be a mockery"", said Yann Louvel, Climate and Energy Campaign Coordinator at BankTrack. ""While financial institutions like the World Bank are waking up to the reality that coal is yesterday's fuel, Bank of America is the America's leading financier of this dirty industry in the US. Its current plans to underwrite Coal India's share offering are deepening its involvement, and show a worrying disregard for biodiversity and basic workers' rights"".
""Coal India has a record of forcibly displacing tribal and farming communities, ravaging tiger and elephant forests and turning a blind eye to instances of child labour and corruption,"" said Ashish Ferndandes, US-India Advisor with Greenpeace. ""We have pointed out these issues to Bank of America on several occasions over the past year and been assured that the bank is looking into them. To have the Bank persist with its partnership with Coal India leaves one with the impression that ‘sustainability' is just a fancy word to CEO Brian Moynihan and his team.""
Alongside Bank of America's addition, the Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) was chosen as the new Industry Group Leader in the banking sector, despite recent financing of a number of high carbon, environmentally destructive projects, often in sensitive areas. Most notably, ANZ is Australia's biggest lender to a series of coal and gas export terminal projects that threaten to destroy the Great Barrier Reef (4).
Julien Vincent, Lead Campaigner at Market Forces, commented: ""Global warming is being driven to the point of no return, the Great Barrier Reef is heading for the World Heritage in danger list, ANZ is funding the very projects driving these crises as if it were an obsessive habit and they win a sustainability award? It's little wonder that the world of finance is so often met with suspicion, when its most environmentally destructive members get a pat on the back.""

Tegucigalpa ",Indigenous protest against Agua Zarca dam in Honduras criminalised,,,Agua Zarca hydro project ,energy plants - dams,Honduras,"
On September
12, three leaders of the Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of
Honduras (COPINH) must appear in court to face trumped up charges by the
Honduran regime and DESA, a hydroelectric dam company. Berta Caceres Aureliano
Molina and Tomas Gomez, are being brought to court under charges of being
""intellectual authors"" of the anti-dam movement opposing the Agua Zarca dam and
inflicting damage on property of DESA.
The highly politicized case is
aimed at criminalizing COPINH and breaking the strong resistance of the Lenca
indigenous communities to illegal damming, logging, and mining operations in
their ancestral territories, in particular the construction
of the Agua Zarca hydro electric project. This project, with a planned capacity
of 22 MW, started construction in 2011 in the Lenca region Río Blanco in western
Honduras and is currently reported to be 15% complete.
Agua Zarca is owned by the Honduran company DESA and
constructed by the Chinese corporation Sinohydro, the German company Voith
Hydro (a joint venture between Voith and Siemens) and the Centroamerican company
COPRECA.  It is financially supported by the Central American Bank for
Economic Integration (CABEI) which provided DESA with a US$ 24.4 million loan.
CABEI mentions as co-financiers the Netherlands Development Finance Company
(FMO) and the Central American Mezzanine Infrastructure Fund (CAMIF), a
investment fund managed by EMP Global. 
Since the beginning of construction, the vast majority
of the local Lenca population, organized in the wider regional indigenous
movement COPINH, has expressed its fear of losing access to the river and water
supply, and of the destruction of communal lands necessary for subsistence
farming.  Until now, their opinion and their right to withhold Free Prior
Informed Consent to the project, as granted to them in the ILO Convention 169 and
ratified by Honduras, has been ignored.
The dam project is being forcefully implemented,
resulting in the violation of indigenous land rights, the militarization of the
Río Blanco area, intimidation of dam opponents  and violent repression of the street blockade
which the local population has maintained since 1st April 2013. This repression
has included the shooting of peaceful protesters on 15th July by the military,
an event in which one local indigenous leader (Tomás Garcia, pictured) was killed and several other
protesters were injured. 
Berta Cáceres, the General Coordinator of COPINH and an
internationally recognized social movement leader, makes clear that COPINH
rejects the dam as it threatens to destroy indigenous ways of life and because
of the undemocatic and violent imposition of the project on them: ""Our
rejection isn´t against truly clean energy production. We aim at a development
based on human dignity, on respect for mother earth, on the fragile equilibrium
between human beings and our planet. We aim at an energy production which
respects ecosystems, human rights, territorial, cultural and indigenous rights.""
If the court convicts and imprisons the three indigenous
leaders, this would be a heavy blow against the indigenous Lenca resistence and
many other struggles in defense of Honduran territory against the violent and
undemocratic imposition of such power projects.
The resistance of
COPINH against the project is supported by an ever growing number of
international allies. BankTrack has recently joined this alliance of
supporters, focusing its attention on the financiers of the project, specifically
Dutch development bank FMO. We are questioning whether they have met their own
policies on stakeholder engagement and respect for indigenous rights when
financing this project, and seeking a formal position from them on the violent oppression
of the indigenous resistance. Updates on this will be posted on the Agua Zarca
profile on the BankTrack website.

San Francisco ",Greenpeace and Rainforest Action Network call out Bank of America for major stake in Coal India deal,Bank of America ,United States,Coal  ,mining - coal ,India,"
Bank of America will act as a merchant broker for the $1 billion sale of shares in Coal India Limited, the world's largest coal miner with a controversial environmental and human rights record, according to reports from India. News of the deal comes despite Bank of America's stated commitment to sustainability, prompting strong criticism from Rainforest Action Network (RAN) and Greenpeace.
""Coal India has a record of forcibly displacing tribal and farming communities, ravaging tiger and elephant forests and turning a blind eye to instances of child labor and corruption,"" said Ashish Ferndandes, US-India Advisor with Greenpeace. ""We have pointed out these issues to Bank of America on several occasions over the past year and been assured that the bank is looking into them. To have the Bank persist with its partnership with Coal India leaves one with the impression that ‘sustainability' is just a fancy word to CEO Brian Moynihan and his team.""
""We are deeply disappointed with Bank of America's decision to do business with Coal India,"" said Ben Collins, Research and Policy Campaigner with RAN. ""If Bank of America can't say 'no' to this deal in light of Coal India's involvement in human rights abuses, corruption and forest destruction, the bank's promises to respect communities and the environment mean nothing.""
In response to sustained criticism from RAN and other groups over its financing of the coal industry, Bank of America has attempted to rebrand itself in more climate friendly terms but has failed to make a meaningful move away from coal. In contrast, other lending institutions like the US Exim Bank and the World Bank have announced plans to limit lending to coal.
Greenpeace and RAN raised the issue of Bank of America's involvement with Coal India at the bank's Annual General Meeting in Charlotte last spring and then wrote to CEO Brian Moynihan earlier this month, urging him to steer clear of the Coal India share offer. The organizations warned of Coal India's track record that includes forest destruction, forced displacement of communities and the use of child labor. Despite these warnings, the bank pursued the deal. (1)
Other global banks that will be part of the Coal India share offer include Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank. Greenpeace has written to these entities warning them that involvement with Coal India poses both financial and reputational risks.

Edinburgh ",Dart attempt to salvage controversial gas plans,,,,,,"
Commenting on the news of Dart Energy's effort to raise £12 million , Friends of the Earth Scotland Campaigns Co-ordinator Mary Church said:
""This looks like a last desperate attempt by Dart to convince investors to salvage its highly uncertain and controversial coalbed methane plans.
""The company's portfolio has been shrinking ever since Dart was kicked out of Australia and had to slash its global workforce by 70% earlier this year. It's clear that Dart's hopes of generating income are now pinned on the Airth coalbed methane scheme, but the project faces strong local opposition and a lengthy public inquiry process.
""In today's announcement Dart carefully fail to mention that HSBC have frozen its loan facility due to delays with the Airth project, and that new Scottish Government planning proposals could make its operations unviable. Dart also fail to recognise the major risk to its gas plans presented by the strength of community opposition at Airth, and throughout the UK as demonstrated at Balcombe.
""Potential investors should beware and think twice before throwing good money after bad money on Dart.  Unconventional gas is unsafe, unnecessary and unwanted, and Dart has a Sisyphean task ahead of it to convince communities otherwise.""
Trading in Dart Energy securities was halted last week, shortly after HSBC froze its substantial loan facility to Dart Energy because of delays with the Airth coalbed methane project.
Dart's effort to re-capitalise comes hours after respected economist Lord Stern criticised David Cameron's claims that an unconventional gas boom would bring gas prices down as ""baseless economics"".
Friends of the Earth Scotland are calling for a ban on all unconventional gas extraction because of the climate and local environmental and health risks associated with the industry.

3. ""'Baseless economics': Lord Stern on David Cameron's claims that a UK fracking boom can bring down price of gas"" 
4. ""Fracking row: Scottish village of Airth could be next battleground between energy firms and green campaigners"" 
5. In April 2013 Dart announced a major restructure including slashing 70% of its global workforce. Dart's Top man in Europe Mark Lappin quit in July.
6. Australian company Dart Energy is the leading unconventional gas developer in Scotland.  Dart's flagship development at Airth, near Falkirk faces strong community opposition and has been beset by delays. In June 2013 Dart appealed their application for 22 new wells, a gas and water treatment facility and a network of pipelines to the Scottish Government on grounds of non-determination. A Public Inquiry process is expected to start from the second half of October 2013.
7. Dart Energy has pulled out of its Australian ventures following a ban on all unconventional gas activity - not just hydraulic fracturing - within 2km of residential areas introduced by the New South Wales Government. A conservative estimate suggests there are at least 2,000 homes within 2km of Dart Energy's Airth development. If a similar ban were in place in Scotland Dart's development at Airth could not go ahead.
8. A study by the Queensland Government found that 44% of the 58 wells tested in 3 fields were leaking. Research by the Southern Cross University in Australia found gas was leaking at around 3.5 times the level expected in coalbed methane fields http://www.scu.edu.au/news/media.php?item_id=6041&action=show_item.
9. The industry in Australia estimates that up to 40% of coalbed methane wells will eventually be fracked. See Australian National Greenhouse Accounts, Coal Seam Gas Estimation and Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions 2012.
10. Methane is a highly potent greenhouse gas that over its short lifetime is over a hundred times more damaging to the climate than carbon dioxide. Research indicates that unconventional gas could be worse in climate terms than burning coal because of methane leakage from gas fields. See Cornell University and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) who found that 9% of total gas production at a field in Utah was leaking into the atmosphere.
11. An investigation by a GP in early 2013 of 38 households in close proximity to coal seam gas wells in Tara, Queensland, found that 58% of residents reported definite adverse health effects related to gas drilling and a further 19% were uncertain. Symptoms include breathing difficulties, rashes, joint and muscle pains, nausea and vomiting, and spontaneous nosebleeds. See here.
12. Bans and moratoria around the world
France: A nationwide ban on fracking   Switzerland: A moratorium on fracking was introduced in the canton of Fribourg   Germany: Moratorium in Northrhine-Westphalia on fracking.

",Who owns Belo Monte?,Allianz ,Germany,Belo Monte dam ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"
The Belo Monte project (planned to be the world's third largest dam) is widely believed to be a national project owned, constructed and financed by Brazilian consortia. More detailed analysis shows however, that roughly 10 % are indirectly owned by foreign - including European - corporations. Given the dam's tremendous environmental and human rights impacts, this case shows once more the lack of effective policies of these corporations to prevent their capital from getting involved in human rights abuses and environmental destruction.
Foreign shareholders include JP Morgan Chase (4.3 %), Iberdrola (3.9 %) and Skagen KT Verdipapirfond, Black Rock, Mitsui, Vanguard Group, Société Générale as well as Allianz with minor participations. While the individual shares may be small, they nonetheless point at the urgent need for implementing dam and human rights policies. And the Belo Monte project, in the eyes of its critiques, marks only the beginning of renewed dam building in the Amazon, with the Brazilian government planning up to 60 large dams. "

Scotland ","RBS carbon emissions up to 1,200 times higher than reported figure",Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS)  ,United Kingdom,,,,"
New research has revealed that Royal Bank of Scotland's 2012 carbon emissions could be up to 1,200 times higher than the figure reported by the bank, and 18 times the total emissions of Scotland. The study by the World Development Movement estimates that emissions resulting from RBS's loans to coal, oil and gas companies bring the bank's 2012 carbon footprint to up to 911 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent. The much smaller figure of 735,000 tonnes reported by the bank includes only its direct use of fossil fuels and electricity, and business travel.
RBS made loans of over £45 billion to fossil fuel companies and energy finance companies between 2008 and 2012, making it one of the UK's biggest financers of high carbon energy. At least £43 billion of these loans were still active at the end of 2012. In comparison, the bank lent just £167 million for renewable energy in the same year.
The estimated RBS carbon footprint for 2012 is 1.6 times the emissions of the whole of the UK in 2012, as well as 18 times the emissions of Scotland in 2011, the latest year for which figures are available.
The World Development Movement says the new figures are evidence of the extent to which the UK finance sector is bankrolling climate change.  The campaign group is calling on the government to force banks, pension funds and other finance companies to publish the emissions from the coal, oil and gas extraction they finance worldwide.
New rules coming into force in October mean companies like RBS will be obliged to report the carbon emissions from their own energy use, but will not have to tell the public about emissions from the dirty energy projects they finance.
Liz Murray, campaigner at the World Development Movement, said today:

""RBS's true carbon footprint dwarfs the emissions not just of Scotland where it is headquartered but of the whole of the UK. And RBS is just one example. All of the UK's big banks are fuelling climate change by financing the continued extraction of coal, oil and gas around the world, and they are not going to quit unless they are forced to by regulation. We need tough government action to wean the UK finance sector off dirty energy, and making banks come clean on the emissions from the fossil fuels they finance would be the first step.""

Read the study, ‘RBS's true carbon emissions 2012:  An estimate of emissions resulting from energy loans made during that year, and the shortcomings of the existing reporting framework', by the World Development Movement.

India ",Big banks warned to steer clear of Coal India share offer,Bank of America ,United States,Coal  ,mining - coal ,India,"
Can a bank claim to be green at heart, in favour of environmental sustainability and advocate for the transition to a low carbon economy while continuing to fund Coal India, one of the worst environmental criminals in India? That, in effect, is the question Greenpeace has posed to a slew of big banks, Citi, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs among them, together with our allies at Rainforest Action Network.
Coal India's much delayed and seemingly jinxed share offer is finally moving, with the government inviting bids from merchant bankers and brokers to assist in the share sale. The government has already reduced the sale from 10% to 5% of Coal India shares, in an ill-fated bid to buy the support of CIL's trade unions. The unions have opposed the government's divestment fearing that an increase in foreign ownership could lead to a loss of jobs, harsher working conditions and lower benefits. They have also cited a promise from this government that it would not seek to divest more shares for the rest of its term - a promise the government is now breaking.
Citi, Bank of America and Deutsche Bank are among the multinational banks pondering bids to be the merchant bankers for the share sale, which could be valued at Rs. 8,400 crore (approx $1.4 billion). Each of these giant banks claim to be guided by environmental and sustainability policies. Yet all three of them were underwriters for Coal India's 2010 IPO.
As anyone familiar with Coal India will know, there is nothing environmentally friendly or sustainable about their operations. Not only do they produce coal, which kills thousands of Indians every year, they do so by the most destructive method possible - open pit mining - invariably in forested areas, displacing tribal communities and destroying biodiversity, including endangered species like the tiger and elephant. There are shocking reports of child labour in some Coal India operations, showing that CIL's internal governance mechanisms are seriously flawed.
So Greenpeace is challenging these big banks to walk the talk. And if ethical and environmental reasons aren't enough, there are serious financial risks that Coal India poses to any investor. The company's stock price has nosedived and it is now almost at its original levels after the 2010 IPO. Despite lofty claims, production continues to lag far behind demand, with targets being missed on a regular basis. The government, which will remain the majority shareholder, has been keeping coal prices artificially low even as cost of production increases, meaning that the share price is likely to remain under downward pressure.
The problems faced by coal are not singular to India, but are part of a larger global shift. Goldman Sachs itself has predicted that coal is going to be eroded by environmental regulations, renewable energies and energy efficiency, warning that the window for profitable investments in coal is rapidly closing.
So what will Bank of America, Citi and Deutsche Bank do? Will they demonstrate their commitment to a more sustainable, low carbon economy, or will they show that money trumps morality yet again?

Philippines ",Success for protest movement: Glencore Xstrata has to pass on controversial mining project,,,Tampakan Copper and Gold Mine project ,mining - non coal,Philippines,"
The raw material and mining company Glencore Xstrata reduced its activities in the disputed Tampakan mine project in the Philippines. The decision is justified by the lack of consent of the local population and the prohibition of the provincial government of South Cotabato to operate an open-cast mine. In June, NGOs claimed that the mine project would lead to a displacement of 5,000 indigenous inhabitants and accused Glencore of trivializing the issue. Glencore is now trying to engage in closer cooperation with the local government and interest group in order to develop a new approach.     "

Melbourne ",Australian coal projects could be ineligible to receive Chinese finance,Agricultural Bank of  ,China,Great Barrier Reef Coal & Gas Exports ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,Australia,"
Chinese banks have been notified that several Australian-based coal export projects could be ineligible for credit under China's Green Credit Directive. A letter from international banking sector watchdog BankTrack and Australian environment group Market Forces has been sent to eight major Chinese overseas lenders, highlighting an array of environmental and social impacts that would result from new coal export projects. It also profiles the corporate citizenry records of GVK and Adani, two Indian conglomerates who are both proposing new coal export projects.
Under the Green Credit Directive issued in 2012, Chinese banks are specifically obligated to strengthen and regulate the management of environmental risks for loans made to overseas projects. Chinese banks assess the environmental and social impacts of their loans, ensure clients uphold international norms, and have the power to deny finance, suspend and even terminate a granted loan in cases where major risks have been identified.
""All too often, when banks are made aware of environmental risks to a project or industry, they lack a clear decision-making framework with which to assess those risks"", said Yann Louvel, Climate and Energy Campaign Coordinator for BankTrack. ""The Green Credit Directive will help banks apply risk management procedures to some of the most environmentally damaging fossil fuel projects on the planet, and it is unlikely to be good news for coal project developers seeking finance.""
A key issue raised in the letters was the threat posed by new coal export terminals to the Great Barrier Reef's World Heritage Status. The World Heritage Committee will consider placing the Reef on the ""World Heritage in Danger"" list in 2014, their concerns driven largely by the uncontrolled expansion of coastal development. Both GVK and Adani are attempting to reach financial close for their proposed coal export terminals - which would be built in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area - this year.
""No bank will want to be known as a funder of the project that cost the Great Barrier Reef its World Heritage status. Hopefully the Green Credit Directive will ensure that this title will not end up with a Chinese institution"", said Julien Vincent, Market Forces Lead Campaigner.
Research by Market Forces released in June showed that Chinese banks have provided almost AU$4 billion in loans to coal and gas export projects between 2008 and 2012. GVK had previously identified the China Exim bank as interested in financing their Alpha Coal project1, a 30 million tonne per year export coal mine, 500 km rail line and new coal export terminal at Abbot Point in Queensland.

San Francisco, USA ","Dump Now, Pay Later",,,,,,"
The U.S. coal-fired power plant fleet produces over 130 million tons of coal ash each year, much of which is buried in landfills or stored as wet slurry in more than a thousand containment ponds around the country. Many of these ponds and landfills were built without synthetic bottom linings and therefore leach toxic coal ash contaminants into groundwater. And since 2002, multiple coal ash ponds have ruptured without warning, resulting in disastrous ash spills. RAN's Coal Risk Update for July 2013 assesses the legal, regulatory, and financial risks facing electric power producers that own coal ash ponds and landfills.
Forthcoming EPA coal ash regulations will likely require power producers to close hundreds of coal ash ponds that lack a bottom lining. These closure costs will range from under $1 million to potentially over $100 million per pond and may, in combination with other new coal ash regulations, accelerate the closure of smaller coal-fired generating units. Contamination from ponds and landfills has also prompted several environmental groups and more recently, a major plaintiff firm to file lawsuits on behalf of residents near contamination sites.
This report assesses EPA coal ash pond data and finds that the following electric power producers are most exposed to ash pond failure risk and groundwater contamination risk based on their ownership of high-risk ponds:




U.S. electric power producers with the most coal ash ponds with significant or high hazard ratings
U.S. electric power producers with the most coal ash ponds that lack bottom linings


1. Duke Energy (24)
1. Duke Energy (45)


2. Tennessee Valley Authority (19)
2. Southern Company (45)


3. American Electric Power (18)
3. American Electric Power (36)


4. PPL Corporation (12)
4. Tennessee Valley Authority (28)


5. Southern Company (10)
5. AES Corporation (22)



Unlined coal ash ponds and landfills can leach contamination into groundwater for decades, leaving investors in publicly traded electric power producers exposed to major litigation and regulatory compliance risks. However, the report finds that electric power producers have disclosed very little information about their coal ash ponds and landfills or their plans for managing hazard and contamination risks at these disposal sites.

Melbourne ",Sixty prominent Australians call on ‘big four’ banks to end fossil fuel investment,ANZ ,Australia,Great Barrier Reef Coal & Gas Exports ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,Australia,"
Sixty prominent Australians are calling on the CEOs of the big four banks to stop investing in the fossil fuel industry through an open letter organised by Market Forces and 350.org launched today.
Nobel Laureate in Literature John Coetzee, two-time Booker Prize winning author Peter Carey, two-time Olympic Rower Victoria Roberts, musicians Claire Bowditch and Mark Seymour and former politicians Carmen Lawrence and Cheryl Kernot topped the list of leading Australians who signed the letter, directed to the CEOs of ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, NAB and Westpac. Professor Peter Singer and climate change scientist Professor Lesley Hughes joined business and religious leaders, artists, academics and health professionals who took part.
The letter will appear in mainstream media advertisements from Saturday1, while an online version of the letter allows members of the public to add their own name in support of the letter.
""When 60 leading Australians representing such diverse backgrounds demand bold action from our banks to avoid runaway climate change, it's time to listen,"" said Market Forces Lead Campaigner, Julien Vincent.
Former Chair of the Australian Coal Association Ian Dunlop, also a signatory to the letter, said ""The coal industry, and its bankers, have known for more than 3 decades that carbon emissions from coal consumption would, at some stage, stop expansion of the industry.  That time has now come.""
The letter comes as US President Barak Obama, in a speech this week, encouraged fossil fuel divestment campaigns in his own country and a week after the Australian Government's Climate Commission released a report acknowledging that most of the world's fossil fuel reserves would need to be left in the ground in order to prevent global temperatures rising more than 2˚C above pre-industrial levels.
""The big four banks have been playing an instrumental role in financing the expansion of the fossil fuel industry, which is threatening natural icons such as the Great Barrier Reef, as well as our chances of avoiding runaway climate change,"" said Mr Vincent. ""We need Australians to get behind this call to the big banks, telling them it is not acceptable to finance this environmentally destructive and economically risky industry.""
To view the open letter and its complete list of signatories online, please visit: http://openletter.marketforces.org.au Signatories are available to speak to media on request.

New York ",India and POSCO Must End Abuses Linked to Steel Project,Deutsche Bank ,Germany,,,,"
The Government of India must end human rights abuses
tied to its project with South Korean steel giant POSCO, and must immediately
cease illegal seizures of land which threaten to forcibly displace as many as
22,000 people in India's eastern state of Odisha, said rights groups in a new
report released today.
The
report, The Price of
Steel: Human Rights and Forced Evictions in the POSCO-India Project, comes as affected communities gather to
protest the eighth anniversary of the signing of the POSCO-India project MoU,
and as some of POSCO's international investors meet in Paris at the OECD's Global
Forum on Responsible Business Conduct.
The
Price of Steel-which was produced
by the International Human Rights Clinic (IHRC) at NYU School of Law and the
International Network for Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ESCR-Net)
based on a year-long investigation-calls for a suspension of the POSCO-India
project and a halt to abuses before they become even more catastrophic in
scale.
""Should
the project move forward, entire villages will be decimated, livelihoods will
be destroyed, and families will be rendered homeless, all in the name of
‘development,'"" said Miloon Kothari, former UN Special Rapporteur on the
right to adequate housing and Executive Director of the Housing and Land Rights
Network. ""Forced evictions present serious threats to human rights. The
impact on those affected can often be characterized as a human tragedy.""
Worth
approximately US$12 billion, the POSCO-India project represents the largest
single foreign direct investment in India to date, and will require more than
12,000 acres of land, including approximately 4,000 acres for an integrated
steel plant and captive port in an area that is home to forest-dwelling
communities and a vibrant and sustainable local economy centered around betel
leaf cultivation. For the past eight years, through sustained and peaceful
opposition, affected communities-including betel leaf farmers, fisherfolk, and
Dalits-have effectively stalled the project and resisted their forcible
evictions from lands they have cultivated for generations.
The
Price of Steel finds
that India's attempts to forcibly evict these communities stand
in violation of international and domestic law. International legal
standards require that India exhaust all feasible alternatives to forced
evictions; engage in genuine consultation with project/affected communities;
ensure the provision of adequate compensation for affected properties; and
follow procedures established by law. India has systematically failed to live
up to each and every one of these standards.  In addition, under India's Forest Rights Act, the government must secure the
consent of forest dwelling communities before diverting forested land.
Affected communities have passed several village resolutions fervently
rejecting the diversion of land for the POSCO-India project, resolutions that
the Indian government has effectively ignored.
""India's
attempts to forcibly evict communities for the POSCO project are in clear
violation of Indian and international law,"" said Professor Smita Narula,
co-author of the report and Faculty Director of IHRC. ""Project-affected
communities are living under siege, and suffering severe violations of their
fundamental human rights. India must act now to end these abuses and put the
rights of its people ahead of the needs of a corporation.""
Indian
authorities have actively targeted those who speak out against the POSCO-India
project with violence and arbitrary arrests and detentions. Local police have
barricaded villages, occupied schools, and leveled thousands of allegedly fabricated
criminal charges against project protestors. Indian authorities have also
refused to project protestors from consistent and sometimes fatal attacks by
private actors who are allegedly motivated by the interests of the company and
of the State.
As a result of these abuses, for the past eight years,
entire communities in the project-affected area have been living under siege
and have suffered clear violations of their rights to security of person and
freedom of movement; their rights to be free from arbitrary arrest and
detention; and their right to be free from discrimination-particularly on the
basis of political or other opinions. Living under siege has also resulted in
significant disruptions to many villagers' ability to access health care,
schools, markets, and crops, undermining their rights to health, education,
work, and food.
""Thousands of affected community members have
struggled to defend their human rights and protect their lands, livelihoods,
and dignity."" said Chris Grove, Director of ESCR-Net. ""Their demands
articulate the reasonable expectations of any just economic development. The
pursuit of foreign investment cannot come at the cost of human rights.""
There is no public evidence to suggest that POSCO has
taken steps to use its leverage to call for a halt to forced evictions, or
an end to human rights abuses associated with the acquisition of land for the
POSCO-India project. Despite widespread reporting of these abuses, in an
April2013 letter to ESCR-Net, POSCO stated that it believes the
""authorities are not using any force to evict any people.""
ESCR-Net
and IHRC call on all relevant actors to take immediate action to fulfill their
respective obligations and responsibilities, and ensure that human rights
are not violated in connection with the POSCO-India project.
Specifically,
the rights groups call on:

 The Indian governmentto suspend the POSCO-India project until
and unless it complies with international human rights standards and domestic
law; cease all attempts at forced evictions and land acquisition; end the
excessive use of force and of arbitrary arrests and detentions; and ensure
project-affected communities unencumbered access to health care, education,
work, and adequate food.
 The Republic of Koreato take all necessary steps to ensure that
POSCO respects human rights throughout the course of its activities, including
by establishing a legislative framework to regulate the overseas activities of
Korean companies.
 POSCO and its wholly-owned subsidiary, POSCO-India, to fully implement its commitment to
uphold human rights; comply with all relevant domestic laws; and provide for or
cooperate in the remediation of any adverse impacts to date.
 POSCO's
international investors-including
ABP, Blackrock, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase, NBIM, and Bank of NY Mellon-to
persuade POSCO to respect the rights of all communities affected by the
POSCO-India project.

Brussels, Belgium / Monrovia, Liberia ",European Investments Assist Land Grabs for Palm Oil in Liberia,,,Sime Darby ,agriculture - palm oil ,Malaysia,"
European banks, 
pension funds and private equity funds have given financial assistance worth 
more than €450 million to Malaysian palm oil giant Sime Darby, responsible for 
environmental degradation and violations of national regulations in Liberia, 
according to new research from Friends of the Earth Europe .An 
independent impact assessment released today (Monday 24th) by Reading University 
reveals that Sime Darby operations could lead to a loss of biodiversity, food 
sources and livelihoods - leading to chronic poverty. There would also be 
significant environmental impacts with the loss of primary and secondary forest. 
Silas Kpanan'Ayoung Siakor, campaigner for Friends of the Earth 
Liberia said: ""Investments in agriculture can benefit the poor, but the reality 
in Liberia is very different. Farmers are losing their land and livelihoods, the 
rights of those living in poverty in rural areas are being violated, and the 
forests on which communities depend are increasingly threatened. I see no 
guarantees that rural communities will benefit in any meaningful way from 
investments in palm oil.""Sime Darby, which receives financial assistance 
from European banks and pension funds including the Norwegian pension fund, 
UK-based Schroder investment management and Dutch funds PfZW, has signed a 
63-year lease with the government of Liberia for 311,187 hectares  to grow 
palm oil, according to Friends of the Earth Liberia and allies .An 
initiative comprised of the private sector, civil society and the Liberian 
government  found Sime Darby culpable of failing to comply with local land laws; 
and of failing to conduct public consultations or produce due diligence reports 
as required by Liberian rules  - directly contradicting investor policies 
that require companies to respect national laws and environmental 
regulation.Anne van Schaik, accountable finance campaigner for Friends 
of the Earth Europe said: ""European funds need to stop financing land grabs in 
Liberia. Even though most investors have sustainability principles there are no 
effective procedures in place to deal with violations - which makes these 
policies meaningless. Investors and financiers need to put their money where 
their mouth is and pressure Sime Darby to stop grabbing land.""Friends of 
the Earth Europe is calling on investors and financiers of Sime Darby to 
pressure the company to clean up its operations, or risk divestment. European 
banks and pension funds should not be contributing to land conflicts with local 
communities, deforestation or to companies who violate national law. Sime Darby 
should bring an immediate end to land-grabbing and deforestation, ensure 
adequate compensation, and any future development should obey national law and 
ensure free, prior and informed consent from affected 
communities.NOTES:

Paris ",Civil society groups mobilize to tell Société Générale to withdraw from the Kaliningrad nuclear project,Société Générale ,France,Baltic nuclear power plant- Kaliningrad ,energy plants - nuclear,Russian Federation,"
Lilles, Nantes, Bordeaux, Nancy, Paris, Tours, Bayonne, Crest - From 24 to 30 June, Friends of the Earth France, Attac France and the ""Nuclear Exit"" network are mobilizing with BankTrack, Ecodefense and other civil society organizations, to denounce Société Générale's participation in the Kaliningrad nuclear power project. With street actions to be organized in front of Société Générale branches in at least eight cities across France, as well as in Russia and Poland, the demonstrations criticize Société Générale's irresponsibility and demand its immediate withdrawal from this dangerous, useless and dodgy project.
Is Société Générale a responsible player in all its banking and financial activities, as it claims to be? The Kaliningrad nuclear project answers ""no"" to this question: it raises numerous technical and financial issues and is very costly in socially, environmentally and human rights terms. Société Générale has however accepted the mandate to structure the export financing of Alstom turbines for this project, with a potential guarantee from the French State, via Coface.   Located in the Russian enclave between Poland and Lithuania, this project aims to penetrate the European market by selling electricity to these neighbouring countries (despite clear indications that they do not want the future potential electricity from the plant).  In addition, the local population has been opposed to the project since its inception. Despite intimidation by the Russian authorities, they continue to denounce the project as useless, costly and very risky. Corruption, a rushed environmental impact assessment, the real risk of a nuclear accident not taken into account, and absence of proper waste management are only some of the issues raised.
Add to this a number of technical and financial issues, and it is no surprise that several international banks, including BNP Paribas and German bank HypoVereinsbank, have already refused to finance the project. Friends of the Earth France call on Société Générale and Coface to follow their example and to immediately withdraw from financing or guaranteeing this project.
The mobilisation against this project started in April with a cyber-action against Coface and Société Générale  signed by more than 4,500 people and an open letter from 94 organisations in 22 countries to the bank's CEO, Frédéric Oudéa. Vladimir Slivyak, from Russian NGO Ecodefense, then participated in the bank's AGM in Paris in May, taking the call directly to  Mr Oudéa.
While France is actively using its diplomatic links to keep this project alive, protesters are taking to the streets. With street actions infront of local Société Générale branches, picnic debates and processions in market places, local groups from Friends of the Earth France, Attac France and the ""Nuclear Exit"" network are planning to inform citizens and clients and to incite them to challenge their bank managers on their investments abroad.
Lucie Pinson, private finance and Coface campaigner for Friends of the Earth France, concludes: ""Société Générale has adopted a sectoral policy for the nuclear sector which is well below the standard expected from a bank that claims to be responsible. However even this inadequate policy is not respected by the bank, as the Kaliningrad project proves. It is well past time for Société Générale to act and finally withdraw from this dodgy deal"".

Brussels ",EU Ministers Leave the Door Open for Harmful Food Speculation,,,,,,"
Little will be done to curb harmful food speculation today as EU finance 
ministers meet to approve their position on the new Markets in Financial 
Instruments Directive (MiFID II) - which sets new regulations for financial 
markets. According to a broad coalition of environmental and development 
organisations, loopholes in the legislation will render it ineffective to 
prevent food speculation, and the resulting food price spikes that hit the 
poorest the hardest.Anne van Schaik, accountable finance campaigner at 
Friends of the Earth Europe, said: ""Food speculation profits financial 
institutions, and costs the world's most vulnerable the food on their plates. 
Watertight regulation of food speculation is vital to prevent excessive 
speculation driving up food prices - but finance ministers have failed to agree 
effective controls, such as limits to the bets that speculators can 
make.""Marc Olivier Herman, EU policy advisor at Oxfam, said: ""EU 
governments failed to tackle the systemic risk that unbridled speculation poses 
to world food security. It is now crucial that the European Parliament takes a 
stronger position in upcoming negotiations on behalf of the millions in poor 
countries who are hit by high and unpredictable food prices, and for families in 
the EU who feel the impacts of rising food bills.""The organisations 
expressed concern that European regulators will not set adequate EU-wide limits 
to the bets speculators can make and that limits may not be comprehensive or 
applicable to all types of traders - which will allow financial institutions to 
sidestep regulation. Christine Haigh, policy officer at the World 
Development Movement said: ""We are deeply concerned over the fact that in the 
current text, limits on speculation will be set at national level, rather than 
being consistent across the EU. This will pit the member states against each 
other in a ‘race to the bottom' to set the weakest limits"".Myriam Vander 
Stichele from SOMO said: ""The new legislation will not be effective if there are 
no clear position limits on over-the-counter commodity derivatives or ‘swaps', 
often linked to speculative trading. The US has put such limits into law and the 
EU must follow suit in order to prevent traders from avoiding these new rules. 
The EU has been giving in to too many demands from the financial services 
lobby.""Discussions between the European Parliament and Council will 
continue with an agreed text due for adoption in March 2014, supported by the 
European Commission. The organisations identified eight of the most dangerous 
loopholes and outlined solutions  - to ensure European policy-making puts the 
hunger of people before the greed of financial institutions and puts a stop to 
the damage done by financial markets through excessive and harmful 
speculation.***NOTES:

Sydney ","Investor Alert: GVK's US$10 billion Australian coal project uneconomic, an unacceptable risk",ANZ ,Australia,,,,"
A new report released today by US-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) - ‘Stranded: A financial analysis of GVK's proposed Alpha Coal Project in Australia's Galilee Basin' - has revealed that the US$10 billion Alpha coal mine, port and rail project is uneconomic and represents an unacceptable level of risk to potential investors.
The report comes as Australian rail operator AURIZON (ASX: AZJ) negotiates to partner with Indian conglomerate GVK (BSE: 532708 | NSE: GVKPILEQ) on the construction of the rail and port components of the Alpha project at a cost of US$6 billion.
Commenting on the risk profile of the project, report co-author, IEEFA's Tom Sanzillo, former first deputy comptroller of New York, labelled GVK ‘a weak investment partner' and the Alpha project ‘a quagmire, not an investment'.
GVK is seeking to raise a total of US$10 billion capital to build Australia's largest black coal mine in Queensland's remote, untapped Galilee Basin; construct 500km of rail infrastructure across agricultural land and floodplains to the coast; and develop a highly controversial coal export terminal through the iconic, UNESCO World Heritage listed Great Barrier Reef.
The IEEFA report shows that GVK:

 has never successfully built or operated a coal mine or any business outside of India.
is overcommitted, with16 greenfield infrastructure projects worth $20 billion across six asset classes.
is highly overleveraged, carrying debt of US$2.8 billion with   market capitalisation of only $243 million.
faces a plummeting stock price, which has underperformed the Indian share price index by 80% since 2010.
has an excessively low EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) of 0.44x.
confronts potentially insurmountable regulatory, environmental, operational, logistical and financial hurdles that will likely delay the project and escalate costs to the extent that the project is unviable even for a company with a healthy balance sheet.

GVK purchased its Galilee Basin coal deposits from Hancock Prospecting in 2011 for $1.26 billion near the peak of the coal price cycle of $133 / tonne, a deal for which it was awarded ‘Asia Deal of the Year'.The coal price has since slumped to $88 / tonne with cost of production at more than $70 / tonne, as major coal producers now sell, downscale and cancel greenfield projects in response to the weakening global coal outlook.
Tom Sanzillo said, ‘As currently structured, GVK simply cannot afford to participate in the Alpha project due to its plummeting stock price, overleverage, and poor track record on other projects amongst other factors. In short, it lacks the financial capacity to deliver. The cost side of the project is equally troubling.  The impacts of the proposed export terminal on the Great Barrier Reef, the massive rail infrastructure and rising costs of mining are cost factors that will only keep increasing. And finally there is the demand and price of coal on the global markets. Coal markets are weak now, and a strong, sustained comeback is less likely in the face of the maturation of renewable energy, the changing nature of growth in many countries and public concern over coal's health and environmental impacts'.
'Even in the event of environmental approvals, the addition of new partners or other developments, taken together, the cumulative picture of cascading multiple risks and inevitable delays and cost blowouts around the Alpha project means that there is limited investment potential.
‘No investor should take part,' said Mr. Sanzillo.
Report co-author Tim Buckley, independent financial investment analyst said, ‘The risks of capital cost blowouts and significant further timetable delays are high.
Combined with the financial difficulties of the key proponent, the probability of success for this US$10 billion project is remote. The Alpha project is clearly at risk of being stranded as the thermal coal price continues to decline'.
Ben Pearson, Head of Campaigns for Greenpeace Australia Pacific, which commissioned the report, said, ‘It's clear from this report that development of the Galilee Basin for coal is uneconomic and green groups have made it plain they will do everything in their power to stop it.
For AURIZON to get involved in developing port and rail infrastructure to service this project would be financially foolish, leaving it empty handed with stranded assets'"". "

London ","There's no such thing as a sustainable global bank, just yet",,,,,,"
Santander, announced yesterday as the winner of the Financial Times and 
International Finance Corporation’s Sustainable Global Bank of the Year 
award, has invested over one billion euros in sales and production of 
weapons over the last ten years, highlights the campaigning network 
BankTrack. Santander has provided finance to some of the world’s biggest arms 
companies, including the likes of BAE Systems, EADS, Finmeccanica, 
Thales, Honeywell and Lockheed Martin, many of whom are implicated in 
the sale of arms to oppressive regimes (1). This is despite operating a 
defence sector policy which states that it “will not finance projects 
related to arms manufacturing, trade or distribution of anti-personnel 
mines, cluster bombs or nuclear, chemical or biological weapons”.   Arms deals aside, Santander is also one of the principal financiers of 
the highly controversial HidroAysen dam project in Chile, providing 
finance to all of the key companies involved (2). The project will dam 
two of Chile's most powerful and pristine rivers, and the transmission 
lines for the project would require one of the world's longest clearcuts
 – much of it through untouched temperate rainforests of a type found 
nowhere else on the planet outside Patagonia (3).   Santander was presented with the award at an awards ceremony in London 
last night. The other banks shortlisted for the award were Standard 
Chartered and Morgan Stanley, neither of which fare any better in terms 
of their finance for damaging projects around the world.   Standard Chartered, last year’s winner, is helping to finance at least 
eight destructive ‘dodgy deals’ around the world. The projects, which 
campaigners are fighting to reverse, include the extraction of Canada’s 
vast tar sands, risky oil drilling in the Arctic Circle, a destructive 
mega dam project in Laos, and the Sakhalin II oil platform, which is 
endangering the last feeding ground of the critically endangered Western
 Grey Whale (4).   Morgan Stanley, formerly one of the Big Four US investment banks, is a 
key financer of mountaintop removal coal mining, a hugely ecologically 
destructive technique where the tops of mountains are removed to extract
 the coal inside (5).   “We urgently need a finance sector that is truly committed to 
sustainability, and the FT and IFC’s Sustainable Finance Awards rightly 
recognise steps in this direction. But with the Sustainable Global Bank 
of the Year award, the FT and IFC are looking for something which is not
 yet there,” said BankTrack director Johan Frijns.
 “All of the shortlisted global banks are involved in financing socially
 and environmentally devastating projects, in spite of a few flagship 
green projects and some worthy policies. Setting up a sustainability 
award especially for major global banks is premature; as of now, there 
is no such thing as a ‘sustainable’ global bank”

London ",UK government accepts complaint over GCM Resources’ Bangladesh coal mine,,,Phulbari coal mine ,mining - coal ,Bangladesh,"
British company GCM Resources was dealt a serious blow today as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) agreed to consider complaints regarding severe human rights violations associated with the company's planned coal mine in Bangladesh.
GCM wants to open a massive open-pit coal mine in Phulbari in the north-west of Bangladesh, displacing up to 220,000 people and threatening the Sundarbans, one of the world's largest remaining mangrove forests and a UNESCO World Heritage site.
The complaint by the International Accountability Project and the World Development Movement claims that the mine planned by the AIM-listed company would breach OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. It would violate the human rights of indigenous people from 23 different tribal groups, and destroy nearly 12,000 acres of Bangladesh's most fertile and productive farmland.

Phulbari's fertile farmlands are Bangladesh's rice bowl. (Photo courtesy of JACSES)
Eighty per cent of local people depend on the land for their survival, but GCM will not replace their land and its project plans state that ""most households will become landless.""
GCM appealed to the OECD to reject the complaint, but the UK National Contact Point, the governmental body that addresses violations of the OECD guidelines by British companies abroad, has agreed to pursue the issue.
The investigation will evaluate whether GCM has breached obligations to ensure meaningful and adequate consultation about the project, or to carry out appropriate due diligence to ensure that its project does not violate people's human rights.
GCM has faced repeated protests in Bangladesh against the mine. Three people were killed and many more injured when paramilitary officers opened fire on a protest against the project in 2006. In January this year, further protests forced the company's CEO Gary Lye to abandon a visit to the area.
Seven UN human rights experts have called for an immediate halt to the project.
Kate Hoshour from the International Accountability Project said: ""The UN's most senior human rights experts have warned that the mine threatens the fundamental human rights of hundreds of thousands of people, including their rights to food and water. GCM's response has been to redouble aggressive efforts to force the project forward. We welcome the OECD's decision to investigate.""
Christine Haigh, campaigner at the World Development Movement, said: ""This is a clear sign that extractive companies cannot disregard the rights of the people whose land they take and expect to get away with it. The people of Phulbari do not want this coal mine. GCM should listen to them and abandon the project.""
Rumana Hashem, an eye witness to the violence carried out against the people of Phulbari during protests against GCM's plans in 2006, said: ""I am pleased that the OECD has recognised the threats posed by the proposed Phulbari project, although some of the points in its statement should have been stronger. I thought the mine would be cancelled after the violence I saw in 2006. I hope that now it will be, and that GCM will no longer be allowed to operate in Bangladesh.""

Paris ",France must let Kaliningrad nuclear project die !,Société Générale ,France,Baltic nuclear power plant- Kaliningrad ,energy plants - nuclear,Russian Federation,"
While the Kaliningrad nuclear project, in Russia, faces important technical and financial difficulties, France is trying to make it survive whatever the cost. French ambassador to Russia, Jean de Gliniasty, went on Monday in person on the construction site to support the project and urge Russian authorities to go ahead with this project. This support for a dangerous project to which the local population is opposed, as clearly shown by  a recent poll, is unworthy. It reveals the hypocrisy of French authorities on the lessons drawn from Fukushima. Les Amis de la Terre and Ecodefense demand that France let this project die in peace, and that Société Générale withdraw from it immediately. 
The Baltic nuclear power plant project, located in the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, between Lithuania and Poland, has faced important difficulties for several months now. Several news items these past few days revealed a recent decision by Russian authorities to modify substantially the project and the type of reactors planned to be built. Rosatom, the Russian company leading the project, is now considering building smaller reactors, like the VVER-640 or KLT-40S reactors (640 or 40 MW), rather than the two bigger units of 1 150 MW each. The company has one month to make a final decision on this. On the ground, local contractors talk about a complete suspension of the job, started in 2010.
This decision can be explained by the difficulty of the promoters of this project to find financing and concrete prospects. As Ecodefense, the leading Russian NGO against this project, and les Amis de la Terre, have underlined for months now, none of the neighbouring countries want the future potential electricity produced by this power plant. Worst, the Kaliningrad enclave could be totally electrically isolated in coming years with the integration of Baltic states to the European grid. This would stop the nuclear power plant from any prospect since this project aims specifically at penetrating the European electricity market.
In this context and following this news, the French ambassador in Russia, Jean de Gliniasty, decided to visit the construction site of this project in person, to confirm the support of France and the involvement of Alstom in this project, whatever the cost. Vladimir Slivyak, co-chair of the Russian NGO Ecodefense, denounces this support: ""This support by French authorities goes directly against the will of the majority of local inhabitants, 48% of them opposing the project against 30% supporting it, according to a new poll published only a few days ago. It also totally omits the important deficiencies of the project's Environmental Impact Assessment regarding waste management, dismantling and potential impacts of a major nuclear accident. We have been mobilizing against this project since 2007 and this mobilization is starting to pay off. The French ambassador should not worry so much about this project and should let it die in peace. It should on the contrary support the development of renewables in Russia"".
Yann Louvel, climate and energy campaign coordinator for the BankTrack network, concludes: ""This official support reveals the total hypocrisy of French authorities, claiming to draw all the lessons from Fukushima while continuing to actively support the building of nuclear power plants in countries as corrupted and dangerous as Russia. Les Amis de la Terre demand that the French government and Coface withdraw immediately from this project. The same demand goes to Société Générale, which is responsible for structuring  the export financing of Alstom turbines for this project.""

Amsterdam ",New Equator Principles to have deeply underwhelming impact on people and planet,,,Belo Monte dam ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"
The long awaited new, third version of the Equator Principles (EPIII) (1) will have a deeply underwhelming impact on safeguarding the rights and interests of communities affected by ‘Equator compliant‘ projects, as well as on efforts to stop runaway climate change. Thus concludes BankTrack, the global network of NGOs closely monitoring the Principles since their inception in 2003, at the formal launch of EPIII, today in Amsterdam at the 10th Anniversary Conference of the Equator Principles.
""BankTrack considers EPIII a modest improvement over EPII (2), especially with regards to their expanded scope (3) and the transparency requirements for adopting banks. But the new principles are outright disappointing in their absence of any new commitments on strengthening community rights and on combating climate change"", said Johan Frijns, BankTrack coordinator. ""We expected this extensive review process, involving hundreds of stakeholders and taking over two years to complete, to come up with a breakthrough on both crucial matters; this is a huge missed opportunity that leaves the Principles stranded in the Minor League for years to come.""
Community rights
The new Principles fail to strengthen the ability of communities to effectively invoke the Principles to defend their rights and interests. As in EPII, communities are not considered rights holders but remain seen as passive stakeholders in projects that befall on them. The EP requirements on conducting impact assessments, stakeholder engagements, the development of management plans and action plans and the establishment of grievance mechanisms all presume that the project envisioned by the sponsor eventually will proceed as planned.
Despite consistent demands raised by BankTrack and numerous other civil society groups (4) over the last ten years, the Equator Principles Financial Institutions (EPFIs) have also again refused to establish an accountability and compliance mechanism, where affected stakeholders could have filed complaints on non compliance with the Principles.
""The absence of such an accountability mechanism, by now standard procedure with all multilateral development banks and some Export Credit Agencies, makes a mockery of stated ambitions of EPFIs to set a gold standard in social and environmental risk management"", said Michelle Chan, Director, Economic Policy Program for Friends of the Earth US, ""Such accountability mechanisms, apart from being essential to ensure access to remedy, are also a vital part of any adequate risk management system, providing banks with an external source of information on their clients' performance.""
Climate change
The new Equator Principles contain only two climate related ‘requirements' for clients, requirements that are so devoid of any ambition as to render them meaningless in the global fight against climate change. None of the proposals made by BankTrack and other stakeholders to include financed emission reduction targets and opt for the categorical exclusion of certain high impact sectors (coal mining, tar sands) and project types (coal power plants) found their way in the final EPIII.
One ‘requirement' is that ""for all Projects, in all locations, when combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 Emissions are expected to be more than 100,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent annually, an alternatives analysis will be conducted to evaluate less Greenhouse Gas (GHG) intensive alternatives."" However, it is then left entirely to the client to decide what to do with the outcome of the analysis, with no obligation at all imposed on him to opt for the less GHG intensive alternative.
The second ‘requirement' is for ""the client to report publicly on an annual basis on GHG emission levels (combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 Emissions) during the operational phase for Projects emitting over 100,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent annually"". The threshold of 100,000 tonnes is far higher than the 25,000 tonnes required in the Performance Standards of the International Finance Corporation, to which EPIII is pegged. Given the absence of any obligatory reduction targets over time, such reporting requirements alone will also do little to nothing to reduce emissions.
""It took exactly ten years for the very word ‘climate' to first appear in this environmental risk management tool for banks. But when it finally does, there still seems to be no appreciation whatsoever of the magnitude of the threat posed by climate change to all of us, banks included, let alone any corresponding ambition level"" said Yann Louvel, BankTrack's climate and energy coordinator, ""Banks should not need an ‘alternative analysis' or an ‘emission levels report' to understand that they must immediately terminate the financing of coal power plants, coal mines, and oil and gas exploration and infrastructure projects altogether; only that is adequate risk management""
Belo Monte Dam
The launch of the new Equator Principles coincides with the latest occupation by 170 indigenous people armed with bows and arrows of the construction site of the ‘Belo Monte' Dam in Brazil. The groups have vowed to defend their land with their own lives, leading to fears that this may lead to a massacre due to police repression (5).
The project is mostly financed by funding from BNDES of Brazil that is passed through EPFI Caixa Econômica Federal. According to the loan contract, seen by BankTrack, the project is to meet all relevant Equator Principles requirements, including those on stakeholder consultation and indigenous peoples' consent. However, indigenous people say that project developer Norte Energia, S.A. is far from implementing those commitments.
""It is a testimony to the sorry state of the Principles that horrible projects such as the Belo Monte Dam are allowed to proceed with an Equator stamp of approval.  Affected indigenous people stand to lose their lives defending their lands, right at the moment when Equator banks toast on their tenth anniversary"",commented Zachary Hurwitz, Policy Coordinator at International Rivers; ""If the Principles do not even make a difference in such dire situations, then what are they to deliver elsewhere?""

Melbourne ",ANZ biggest gambler on dirty coal and gas exports,ANZ ,Australia,Great Barrier Reef Coal & Gas Exports ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,Australia,"
A new interactive map has been published that identifies ANZ as the commercial bank lending most heavily to coal and gas export projects along Australia's Eastern seaboard, including in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. The map, by Market Forces in partnership with 350.org, allows people to view loans to ports in specific locations and take action to communicate directly with the banks that are named.
ANZ topped the list of over 35 commercial banks, having loaned $2.35 billion (bn) to coal and gas ports from Newcastle to Abbot Point between January 2008 and May 2013. Commonwealth Bank was second on the list having loaned $1.5 bn, followed by NAB ($1.45 bn) and Westpac ($1.16 bn). The ‘big four' Australian banks' contributed almost a third of total project finance lending.
Market Forces and 350.org are encouraging customers of the ‘big four' to put their bank on notice that either loans to coal and gas projects stop, or the customer will be forced to take their money elsewhere. Since the beginning of May, customers accounting for about $13 million in savings have made this commitment.
""The coal and gas industries are hell-bent on expanding, building a new series of export terminals in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area and jeopardising our chances of keeping a lid on climate change,"" said Julien Vincent, Market Forces Lead Campaigner.
""If the big banks lend to these new dirty coal and gas projects, they are taking a massive gamble with the Reef and our climate. It's vital that customers of ANZ, Commonwealth, NAB and Westpac intervene and tell their bank to stop lending to these environmentally destructive projects"", said Mr Vincent.
""When you do the maths on avoiding the worst impacts of climate change, there simply isn't enough room in the carbon budget for new fossil fuel projects. If new coal and gas projects amount to an exercise in digging up unburnable carbon, that makes the loans that enable these projects a massive economic gamble,"" said 350.org co-founder and author Bill McKibben, who arrives in Australia next week for a ""Global Warming: Do the Maths"" tour.

Berlin ",NGOs criticise poor performance new leadership Deutsche Bank,Deutsche Bank ,Germany,Mountain top removal coal mining ,mining - coal ,United States,"
Urgewald - Facing Finance - OXFAM 
-Dachverband der Kritischen Aktionärinnen und Aktionäre 
A day before Deutsche Bank's annual 
shareholders meeting, German NGOs criticise the new leadership of the bank, 
Anshu Jain and Jürgen Fitschen, on their poor sustainability performance. ""A 
year ago, the new leaders promised a fundamental shift in the bank's business 
towards an ethical and ecological responsible bank. However, this is not taking 
place"" says Dr. Barbara Happe of the environmental and human rights organisation 
urgewald. According to Happe, profit at the expense of people and the 
environment remains at the heart of Deutsche Bank's business 
model. Recent research by urgewald and Facing Finance reveals that Deutsche Bank continues to provide 
money to companies that ignore environmental and human rights issues and damage 
the climate. For example, the bank still issues bonds and shares for arms 
manufacturers that deliver arms into conflict areas, as well as for nuclear 
companies. It also continues activities on food speculation. ""Just the 
financial services of Deutsche Bank for 7 of the 10 most controversial companies 
account for more than 2.8 billion Euro"" laments Thomas Küchenmeister of Facing 
Finance. He refers to a ranking of RepRisk, an agency that informs banks about 
the ecologic and social reputational risks of their clients. Deals with arms 
manufacturers alone already amount to nearly 1 billion Euro, despite the fact 
that the bank claims in its sustainability report that it no longer offers any 
financial product that is directly linked to nuclear weapons, cluster 
ammunition, land mines or human rights violations. ""Deutsche Bank 
continues to conduct business with producers of nuclear weapons and cluster 
ammunition, albeit less deals with the latter"", says Küchenmeister. He 
criticises financial relations of Deutsche Bank with arms manufacturers such as 
Rheinmetall, a manufacturer that produces weapons in, and 
delivers weapons to countries that disregard human rights. Deutsche bank 
also continues to support companies involved in Mountain Top Removal coal mining practices. This mining, 
conducted in the Appalachian Mountains in the US involves literally blasting 
away the top of a mountain, leaving the landscape destroyed and the mining waste 
ending in the rivers poisoning the drinking water. Paul Corbit Brown, 
spokesperson of  the organisation 'Keeper of the Mountains' that resists the 
destruction of the region for coal mining, came over from the US to confront the 
bank with the impact of MTR. ""Deutsche Bank has provided money to Alpha Natural Resources and Arch Coal, companies that exercise this type of mining. The 
bank doesn't exclude this kind of companies from financing, which is 
irresponsible"", criticises Corbit Brown. Deutsche Bank also counts 
amongst its clients the controversial Rio Tinto mining company, one of the world biggest producers of 
uranium. Its 'Roessing' mine in Nambia, the world's third largest uranium mine, 
consumes as much water as the Namibian capital Windhoek. ""In a arid country such 
as Namibia this high water consumption of Roessing is a huge problem. Further, 
mining workers and neighbouring communities are suffering from health problems. 
Not surprising since the uranium concentration in the groundwater, soil and 
sediment has strongly increased. Deutsche Bank should not support such clients"", 
demands Bertchen Kohrs of the environmental organisation Earthlife 
Namibia. Deutsche Bank is big in food speculation too. ""The investment 
funds of Deutsche Bank invested 3.79 billion Euro into bets on the price of food 
commodities, such as wheat and corn"", explains Oxfam's expert David Hachfeld. 
""Food speculation increases the risk of price fluctuation and hunger. Poor 
people in developing countries can't afford basic food if the price is rising. 
Deutsche Bank knows the risk, but prioritise the profit."" Last year the bank 
even broke its promise to shelve the establishment of new funds until having 
finished a research into the risk of speculation increasing hunger. However, 
according to research conducted by Oxfam, Deutsche Bank last year launched five 
new investment funds speculating on prices of agricultural raw 
materials. Taking into account this vast range of critique, NGOs rate 
Jain's and Fitschen's first year performance as very poor. They have summarised 
their judgement in a school report, which will be handed over to shareholders at 
the meeting. They call upon shareholders to donate their dividend to communities 
suffering from the bank's business.     "

Paris ",Société Générale AGM: Do not finance Kaliningrad nuclear project,Société Générale ,France,Baltic nuclear power plant- Kaliningrad ,energy plants - nuclear,Russian Federation,"
Société Générale is holding its AGM this afternoon. Les Amis de la Terre
(Friends of the Earth France), along with Vladimir Slivyak, from the russian
NGO Ecodefense, are challenging Frédéric Oudéa, Société Générale CEO, on his
participation to the Kaliningrad nuclear project. Despite the announcements by
BNP Paribas and german bank HypoVereinsbank to refuse to finance this project,
neither Société Générale nor Coface have renounced to it until now. Les Amis de
la Terre relay today more than 4 000 French cyberactivists (1) and 94
organisations from 22 countries (2) asking them to withdraw from this project
immediately.
After a first meeting with Société Générale and Coface
last march, Vladimir Slivyak, from the russian NGO Ecodefense, is back today in
Paris to challenge this time directly Frédéric Oudéa, Société Générale CEO, on
the Kaliningrad nuclear project. Société Générale and Coface have been
solicited to participate to an export financing for Alstom turbines for this
project.
During his intervention, Vladimir Slivyak will remind
what is at stake for this new nuclear power plant: ""Local people oppose this
nuclear project, its electricity is not needed in the region, it's questionable
on economic ground, and doesn't comply with SocGen nuclear policy. Moreover,
there is a threat of repression against activists protesting Baltic nuclear
plant. This project is totally useless since it is only aimed to get access to
the European market by selling the
electricity to neighboring countries which don't want it. The Environmental
Impact Assessment is finally not legal because it raises many issues including
waste management, dismantling and the impacts of a major nuclear accident"".
It must be mentioned that Ecodefense in Kaliningrad already
experience pressure from authorities. On April 26, Ecodefense staged protest
near the office of Rosbank, Russian branch of Societe Generale. One day
earlier, Russian authorities unexpectedly started the inspection of Ecodefense
which resulted in official warning issued by local prosecutor over activities
of organization. Although next official warning may result in the closure of
Ecodefense,  Russian activists intend to
continue campaign against Baltic NPP.
Other banks have already announced that they will not
finance this project. It is the case of BNP Paribas, since December, and the
german bank HypoVereinsbank, subsidiary of Italian group UniCredit, since last
month. Yann Louvel, climate and energy campaign coordinator of the BankTrack
network, continues: ""The Kaliningrad nuclear project doesn't respect
BNP Paribas sector policy on nuclear, and the bank logically refused to finance
it. But this is also the case with Société Générale sector policy on nuclear,
but it doesn't draw from it the same conclusion! Waste management, dismantling
and reaction programs to situations of urgency are totally unsatisfactory.
Without even mentioning corruption and human rights violations, frequent in Russia. Société
Générale must face these facts and draw the good conclusion from this analysis.""
Mobilisation against this project in France started last month on
Chernobyl Day, with a cyberaction supported by Greenpeace, the ‘'Nuclear Exit""
network, ATTAC and the international BankTrack network. Yann Louvel concludes:
""On top of local population and
neighboring countries, who do not want this project, there are now more than
4 000 French citizens and 94 organisations from 22 countries asking
Société Générale to renounce immediately. Société Générale has to announce its
withdrawal today if it doesn't want to see this mobilization growing in the
coming weeks.""

Brussels ",European banks and pension funds fuel land-grabs in Uganda,BNP Paribas ,France,,,,"
European banks and pension funds continue to finance one of the largest and most 
destructive palm oil giants Wilmar International, according to new research 
released today by Friends of the Earth Europe . Well known banks including 
HSBC, BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank and Rabobank offer financial assistance to 
Wilmar valuing over one billion euro, and European and American financial 
institutions own shares in the company worth €621 million .Wilmar 
International owns oil palm plantation and refiners in Indonesia and Malaysia 
. New research from Friends of the Earth Europe links Wilmar's subsidiaries 
on Kalangala Island, Uganda to land-grabs and violations of both national laws 
and environmental legislation .The project has led to the 
deforestation of around 3,600 hectares in Kalangala and displaced farmers 
and their families with no compensation or alternative livelihood options, 
robbing a large number of islanders of their food, medicine, and 
livelihood.Anne van Schaik, accountable finance campaigner at Friends of 
the Earth Europe said: ""Investors need to push Wilmar to clean up its act, or 
put their money elsewhere. Wilmar and its subsidiaries, backed by European 
money, are forcing communities from their land in Uganda.""The majority 
of investors and financiers have sustainability principles guiding investments, 
with some requiring companies to uphold international standards - the UN Global 
Compact Principles, OECD Guidelines and Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil 
(RSPO). However, investors are failing to act despite clear violations by Wilmar 
of these criteria, according to Friends of the Earth Europe.Anne van 
Schaik continued: ""Financial institutions have sustainability principles, but 
don't act despite clear violations by Wilmar. These violations are not new - 
Wilmar has been involved in land rights conflicts and the violation of 
environmental standards for many years. Investors and financiers need to put 
their money where their mouth is.""Friends of the Earth Europe is calling 
on investors and financiers of Wilmar to pressure the company to clean up its 
operations, or risk divestment. European banks and pension funds should not 
becontributing to land conflicts with local communities, deforestation or to 
companies who violate national law. Wilmar should bring an immediate end to 
land-grabbing, ensure adequate compensation, and any future development should 
obey national law and ensure free, prior and informed consent from affected 
communities.NOTES: Read more on Wilmar and its European

in agrofuels, which are putting major and growing pressure on our land, food and 
forests. European countries have set targets and subsidies for agrofuels, to 
meet EU renewable energy goals, but these targets have driven the expansion of 
plantations overseas. Legislation on agrofuels is currently being debated in the 
European Parliament and Council: Friends of the Earth Europe is urging the EU to 
cap and then reduce to zero such fuels, as well as introduce full 
carbon accounting to prevent high carbon fuels like palm oil biodiesel from 
being sold in Europe. Wilmar's subsidiaries are accused of violating 
the National Environmental Act (1988), the Ugandan constitution (1995), the Land 
Acquisition Act (1965) and the Land Act (1998).     "

Paris ",BNP Paribas AGM: stop funding coal!,BNP Paribas ,France,Mountain top removal coal mining ,mining - coal ,United States,"
BNP Paribas is holding its annual general shareholders’ meeting 
(AGM) today in Paris. Les Amis de la Terre (Friends of the Earth France)
 is challenging the bank’s top executives, who present BNP Paribas as a 
“responsible bank”, on its polluting investments in the coal industry. 
Les Amis de la Terre calls on BNP Paribas to stop its dodgy investments 
with disastrous environmental and social impacts, particularly in 
“mountaintop removal” (MTR), an extreme form of surface coal mining 
taking place in the United States. This technique will soon be included 
in a sectoral policy by Crédit Agricole.    After Société Générale and Crédit Agricole last year, Les Amis de la 
Terre is challenging this year BNP Paribas on its investments in the 
coal industry at its AGM today in Paris. According to the report 
“Bankrolling Climate Change” (1), published end of 2011 by BankTrack, 
the international network of which Les Amis de la Terre is a member, BNP
 Paribas ranks number one as top climate killer French bank in the 
world. Yann Louvel, climate and energy campaign coordinator for 
BankTrack, explains: “Between 2005 and 2010, BNP Paribas invested 
more than 10 billion euros in the coal industry, more than the combined 
amounts invested by Société Générale and Crédit Agricole during the same
 period. BNP Paribas is then the eighth climate killer bank in the world
 and the first French one in the “top 20 climate killer banks” ranking 
presented in the report”.  As last year, les Amis de la Terre is not alone in this AGM. Paul Corbit
 Brown, campaigner for the US NGO « Keeper of the Mountain » is coming 
to denounce the impacts of Mountaintop Removal (MTR) in the United 
States. MTR is an extreme form of coal mining which destroys with 
explosives up to 300 meters of the top of the Appalachians in several US
 states, to reach the coal seams underneath. Paul Corbit Brown comments 
on these impacts: ""There is nothing ethical about mountaintop 
removal. It permanently destroys air, water, soil, communities and 
people's health. It has brought nothing but poverty and sickness to the 
communities in my home state.""  Malika Peyraut, Les Amis de la Terre campaigner, denounces: “BNP 
Paribas is involved in the funding of several companies practicing MTR. 
It participated these past few years to the issuance or exchange of 
bonds from ArcelorMittal and Arch Coal, worth hundreds of million euros.
 It also contributed to several loans to Mechel Oao and Metinvest for a 
total of several billion US$. BNP Paribas needs to stop these banking 
activities by adopting a sectoral policy excluding this type of 
activity. Crédit Agricole is already preparing such a policy: BNP 
Paribas also needs to act now!”.    Yann Louvel concludes: “Beyond MTR, BNP Paribas must facilitate the 
energy transition and replace its investments in fossil fuels with 
investments in energy efficiency and renewables. To track this 
evolution, we ask BNP Paribas to publish annually the ratio of its 
investments between those two sectors as well as the calculation and 
reduction of its financed emissions. Such a comparison would be way more
 useful than the sole promotion of the renewables projects it finances, 
which looks like pure greenwash. Rather than praising itself as a 
“responsible bank” by funding research projects on climate change, it is
 time BNP Paribas reduces its own contribution to climate change by 
immediately ending its investments in the sectors wrecking havoc on the 
climate, such as coal.”  (1) The report is available on this page.  *** Immediate reaction following the AGM ***  As an answer to Les Amis de la Terre question, Baudoin Prot, president 
of BNP Paribas group, just announced the imminent publication of a 
sectoral policy for the mining sector. This policy would include 
criteria dealing with ""mountaintop removal"", the form of coal mining 
Paul Corbit Brown came to denounce today. Whether this is good news will
 depend on the criteria included in this policy, resulting in no less 
than a complete exclusion of this sector.  Even so, BNP Paribas will still have to reduce its overall investments 
in the coal industry, publish the ratio of its financing in the fossil 
fuels vs renewables sectors and calculate and reduce its financed 
emissions. Les Amis de la Terre will continue to pressure them on these 
goals. "

London ",Bill Oddie evicted from HSBC Headquarters,HSBC ,United Kingdom,,,,"
Naturalist and comedian Bill Oddie has been filmed being evicted from HSBC's London headquarters while
 protesting against the bank's business ties to companies that are 
illegally destroying rainforests and abusing human rights in Sarawak, 
Malaysian Borneo.
Oddie has teamed up with the campaign group Global Witness to expose 
how the UK's biggest bank has made almost £100 million by providing 
loans and services to some of the most destructive logging companies in 
the world, in violation of the bank's own policies. The short film pokes
 fun at the bank's hypocrisy, but its message is deadly serious. A public petition launched
 alongside the film calls on HSBC CEO Stuart Gulliver to end the bank's 
relationship with the companies destroying Borneo's last virgin 
rainforests.
 ""HSBC has made an absolute killing helping some of the world's worst 
logging companies get off the ground,"" said Oddie. ""According to HSBC's 
own rules and all the evidence, it shouldn't be touching them with a 
bargepole. As a result the last of Borneo's rainforests are under 
immediate threat.  Everyone needs to sign the petition to stop HBSC 
profiting from deforestation in Malaysia and beyond, before it's too 
late.""
Mimicking the style of a nature documentary, the film - titled Bill Oddie's BankWatch -
 studies a new species known as the ""HSBC banker"" in its natural habitat
 in London's Canary Wharf.  Oddie is filmed in HSBC's headquarters 
lambasting the bank's activities in Malaysia, before being forcibly 
ejected from the premises.
Global Witness investigations have shown how HSBC provided loans and 
services to logging companies with close ties to Sarawak's Chief 
Minister Abdul Taib Mahmud. Taib has ruled the state for over three 
decades and controls all land allocation and forestry licencing, and is 
widely understood to abuse this power to enrich his family and 
associates. The companies have been at the forefront of a timber and 
palm oil bonanza that has left less than five per cent of Sarawak's 
rainforests unaffected by logging or plantations.
Taib is currently under investigation by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption 
Commission. By providing services to a sector notorious for corruption 
and high-level political links, HSBC is at serious risk of violating 
international anti-money laundering regulations which require it to 
carry out extra checks on clients linked to senior politicians.
The Global Witness petition, launched
 in conjunction with 38 Degrees, calls on HSBC to hold its hands up to 
its wrongdoing, drop the clients in question and fix its forest policies
 and compliance procedures so that its investments do not finance this 
kind of abuse in future.
""It's high time our banks stop saying one thing while doing the exact 
opposite. You would think after all the scandals HSBC has been caught up
 in of late they'd learn to start telling us the truth,"" said Oddie. ""I 
made a stand in its HQ because customers and shareholders need to know 
what is going on. Watch the film - it's funny, but the message is no 
laughing matter; HSBC must stop bankrolling the world's worst logging 
companies.""

London ",International Finance Corporation and Deutsche Bank bankrolling Vietnamese land grabs in Cambodia and Laos,Deutsche Bank ,Germany,HAGL ,agriculture - non-food crops,Vietnam,"
The International Finance Corporation 
(IFC) and Deutsche Bank are financing Vietnamese rubber companies 
driving a wave of land and forest ""grabs"" in Cambodia and Laos, 
according to a new report and film by Global Witness.
The report, ""Rubber Barons"", reveals how a pervasive culture of 
secrecy around plantation investments in the region has allowed two of 
Vietnam's largest companies, Hoang Anh Gia Lai (HAGL) and the 
state-owned Vietnam Rubber Group (VRG), to acquire more than 200,000 
hectares of land through a series of deals with the Lao and Cambodian 
governments that lack transparency.
It details how these rubber giants, with close links to the region's 
notoriously corrupt political elites, operate with complete impunity, 
devastating local livelihoods and the environment in the process. 
Deutsche Bank has significant holdings in both companies, while the IFC 
invests in HAGL.
 
""We've known for some time that corrupt politicians in Cambodia and 
Laos are orchestrating the land grabbing crisis that is doing so much 
damage in the region. This report completes the picture by exposing the 
pivotal role of Vietnam's rubber barons and their financiers, Deutsche 
Bank and the IFC,"" said Megan MacInnes, Head of the Land Team at Global 
Witness. ""Both companies are having severe impacts on the human rights 
of ordinary Lao and Cambodian citizens.  Often, the first time people 
learn of a plantation is when the company bulldozers arrive to clear 
their farms.""
Cambodia and Laos are undergoing a land grabbing crisis that has seen
 more than 3.7 million hectares of land handed over to companies since 
2000, forty percent of which is for rubber plantations. The report 
reveals how HAGL and VRG‘s operations are characterised by a lack of 
consultation with communities, non-payment of compensation and routine 
use of armed security forces to guard plantations. Large areas of 
supposedly protected intact forest have been cleared, contrary to forest
 protection laws, apparently in collusion with Cambodia's corrupt elite.
 Global Witness is calling for HAGL and VRG to be prosecuted for their 
illegal activities and for their plantation concessions to be cancelled.
Rubber Barons identifies various relationships between Deutsche Bank 
and the IFC - the private lending arm of the World Bank Group - and the 
rubber companies. These investments stand in stark contrast to both 
institutions' public commitments on ethics and sustainability, as well 
as the World Bank's core mandate to end global poverty:

The      IFC currently invests US$14.95 million in a Vietnamese fund that holds      nearly five per cent equity in HAGL (1).
Deutsche      Bank currently holds US$4.5 million in shares in HAGL through its DWS      Vietnam Fund Ltd (2).
In      2011, HAGL became the first Vietnamese company to list on 
the London Stock      Exchange, using Deutsche Bank Trust Company 
Americas as its depository      bank (3).
Deutsche      Bank holds 1.2 million shares in Dong Phu, a member of VRG, which are      currently worth US$3.3 million (1).

HAGL and VRG's ultimate ownership of these companies lies behind an 
intricate web of shell companies. This allows them to disguise the fact 
that they have massively exceeded Cambodia's legal limit on land 
holdings.
Since August 2012, Global Witness has made persistent requests to 
HAGL and VRG to bring their operations in line with local law, resolve 
disputes with affected communities and publicly disclose details of 
their concessions. Neither company has so far acknowledged any 
wrongdoing, or made any commitment to change their behaviour.
Local people's testimony, detailed in Rubber Barons, describes the 
impact of these activities on their communities - increased food and 
water shortages, loss of livelihood without compensation and poor 
employment conditions are commonplace, while indigenous minorities have 
lost burial grounds and sacred forests to the bulldozers. Those who 
protest face violence, intimidation and even arrest, often by state 
authorities who are meant to protect them but instead protect the 
Vietnamese companies.
""These cases are shocking, but they are far from unique,"" said 
MacInnes. ""Until governments bring in and enforce regulations to end the
 culture of secrecy and impunity that is driving the global land 
grabbing crisis, international banks and financial institutions will 
continue to turn a blind eye to the human rights abuses and 
deforestation they are bankrolling.""
When asked, HAGL confirmed holding rubber plantations totalling 
46,752 hectares in Cambodia and Laos but denied knowledge of any 
disputes with local communities or involvement in illegal activities. 
VRG meanwhile stated the evidence presented to them was not true, but 
declined to confirm the status or holdings of its rubber operations in 
either country.

Notes to editor:
1. The report and film accompanying it are available to view and share at www.globalwitness.org/rubberbarons.
2. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has been an 
institutional shareholder in private equity group, Dragon Capital, since
 2002 and currently holds an 8.8% share in the group. In addition, in 
2003, the IFC invested US$8 million directly in Vietnam Enterprise 
Investments Ltd (VEIL), a fund owned by Dragon Capital. This holding was
 increased in 2006 by US$6.95 million and as a result, the IFC currently
 holds approximately 5% of VEIL’s shares. VEIL currently holds just 
below 4% equity in HAGL and 0.64% in HAGL Rubber (a subsidiary of 
HAGL).Separate from investments originating from IFC, Dragon Capital 
also holds a 1.54% interest in HAGL through its Vietnam Growth Fund Ltd.
 This same fund also holds a 1.23% interest in Dong Phu, a share 
currently valued at US$3.18 million.
3. Deutsche Bank finances HAGL directly through its DWS Vietnam Fund 
Ltd, holding 3.4 million shares worth approximately US$ 4.5 million and 
indirectly through its Vietnam Exchange Traded Fund. Media articles have
 also stated two other Deutsche Bank funds as investing in HAGL but 
Global Witness has been unable to confirm this. Deutsche Bank’s DWS 
Vietnam Fund holds 1.2 million shares worth US$3.3 million in Dong Phu, a
 subsidiary of the Vietnam Rubber Group.
4. Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (DBTCA) announced HAGL was 
offering 16 million shares on London’s Professional Securities Market.  
It has been reported that DBTCA continues to retain a certain number of 
shares following this transaction but Global Witness has been unable to 
confirm this

Brisbane ",Report triggers campaign to prevent Australian fossil fuel investment,ANZ ,Australia,Carmichael coal mine project ,mining - coal  | transport and infrastructure,Australia,"
A new report, Financing Reef 
Destruction: How Banks are using our Money to Destroy a Natural Icon, by
 Market Forces and 350.org, makes clear that the ‘big four’ Australian 
banks – ANZ, Commonwealth, NAB and Westpac – play a critical role in 
enabling major fossil fuel projects in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. Combined, these banks lent $3.8 
billion to coal ports and LNG terminals in the Great Barrier Reef Word 
Heritage Area since January 2008.The report also shows a clear 
trend of growing foreign investment, with institutions from China, India
 and the United States all lending multi-billion sums to fossil fuel 
projects in Australia. The single-biggest loan was an AU$2.8 billion US 
Export-Import Bank facility for the Australia Pacific LNG plant on 
Curtis Island in the Great Barrier Reef Wold Heritage Area. That loan 
has landed the Bank in court over an alleged breach of the US Endangered
 Species Act.A series of new coal and gas export projects, 
including mines, overland transport and export terminals are planned 
that would increase fossil fuel exports along Great Barrier Reef 
coastline. Companies including GVK and Adani (India), Samsung (Korea) 
and the China National Offshore Oil Corporation are attempting to open 
up access to coal and gas reserves in Australia.“The big banks 
are using the money of Australians who care about protecting the Great 
Barrier Reef to finance its destruction,” said Julien Vincent, Market 
Forces Lead Campaigner. “This is absolutely unacceptable, and as key 
decision-makers over new dirty coal and gas projects that would damage 
the Reef and drive global warming, the banks have to show leadership and
 refuse loans to these projects.”350.org co-founder and author 
Bill McKibben, coming to Australia in June for a “Global Warming: Do the
 Maths” tour, said “We've got to wind down the fossil fuel era with 
great haste if we're going to keep the planet from overheating. This 
report by Market Forces provides Australians with the information they 
need to make hard decisions about where their money is invested and if 
it's helping or destroying the planet.""The declining state of 
the Great Barrier Reef is making fossil fuel export projects more 
contested in Australia. Opposition to fossil fuel projects in the Great 
Barrier Reef escalated this week, with a series of television 
advertisements telling Queenslanders that they are going to have to 
fight for the Reef. After visiting the Reef in March 2012, UNESCO 
recommended a halt to coastal development that would impact the site’s 
Outstanding Universal Value and that the Reef be considered for 
inscription on the World Heritage In Danger list.Recent reports 
have also highlighted the gulf between fossil fuel development and the 
amount of carbon that the atmosphere can hold if global temperatures are
 to have a chance at staying below 2˚C. A report by CarbonTracker 
recently found that $674 billion was spent in 2012 developing carbon 
assets that may be unburnable if the world takes appropriate action to 
limit carbon emissions1.“When you do the maths on avoiding the 
worst impacts of climate change, there simply isn’t enough room in the 
carbon budget for new fossil fuel projects,” said McKibben. “If new coal
 and gas projects amount to an exercise in digging up unburnable carbon,
 that makes the loans that enable these projects a massive economic 
gamble.”Market Forces and 350.org are calling on customers of 
the big four banks to ask questions about what their money is being used
 for and ultimately to decide if they want to keep their money at 
institutions who are financing reef destruction and global warming.“It’s
 time for Australian bank customers to consider an ultimatum: either the
 banks rule out future loans to coal and gas mining and export projects 
in Australia by the end of the year, or the customers close their 
accounts and take their money elsewhere,” Vincent said.“We hope 
customers taking action stimulates a positive reaction from the banks – 
if they won’t make the right decision for moral reasons maybe they’ll do
 it to preserve their own customer base”, said Vincent.The report, Financing Reef Destruction, is available on this page.1. Carbon Tracker’s research can be found on this page. "

San Francisco ",New Coal Finance Report Card Exposes Risk of Extreme Energy Investments,Bank of America ,United States,Mountain top removal coal mining ,mining - coal ,United States,"
Today, Rainforest Action Network (RAN), Sierra Club and BankTrack released the fourth annual coal finance report card,""Extreme Investments: U.S Banks and the Coal Industry."" The report finds that in 2012 the banking sector financed $20.8 billion for the dirtiest coal companies, even as U.S. coal consumption for power generation fell 11 percent and as mounting scientific evidence confirmed coal's extreme impact on health and climate change. It ranks Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase as the top three financiers of the ""worst of the worst"" coal companies, including operators of coal-fired power plants and mountaintop removal (MTR) coal mines.
The report also found that the top three U.S. financiers of the coal industry (BofA, Citi, & Chase) collectively financed an estimated $9 billion for mountaintop removal mining companies and the most coal-intensive power utilities last year. The report details how financial practices failed to address risks and impacts of an industry in decline and underscores the need for banks to take steps to reduce exposure to coal.
""The bottom line is any bank funding coal puts our health and the climate at risk,"" said Ben Collins, research and policy campaigner for Rainforest Action Network's Energy and Finance program. ""The acute environmental and financial risks of coal have already begun to materialize. For the health of our communities and the sake of our future energy supply, banks must take clear, measurable steps to address the impacts of their coal financing.""
The report includes case studies on the most risk coal investments banks are exposed to, including Patriot Coal, which declared bankruptcy in 2012 and began to phase out its MTR mining operations, and the Tennessee Valley Authority, which recently announced controversial plans to extend the life of a coal plant.
""Mountaintop removal coal mining brings destruction, health problems and human rights violations to the people of Appalachia,"" said  Mark Kresowik,a policy analyst for the Beyond Coal Campaign at the Sierra Club. ""Operations like those at Arch Coal and Alpha Natural Resources are awful investments for the American banking industry. In fact, shares of companies with MTR mines lost an average of 40% of their value between April 2012 and April 2013 and only one of the 13 largest MTR companies had an S&P credit rating above ‘junk.' It's time for our banks to invest in smart, clean alternatives that don't risk our health or the health of our economy.""
The report points out that while many of the banks have adopted environmental policies and due diligence processes, these have had little measurable impact on financing provided to the most polluting coal companies. One notable exception was Wells Fargo bank, which demonstrated substantive improvements in its mountaintop removal lending practices in 2012, resulting in a ""C"" grade.
Of the banks graded for 2013, BNY Mellon received the lowest grades, failing in both categories of exposure to mountaintop removal mining and coal fired power plants. Goldman Sachs and US Bank received two ""D's"" and PNC Financial failed for its coal power financing. Bank of America and Citi tied for most exposure to mountaintop removal, financing companies that mined 42 percent of all MTR coal produced in 2012.
The report finds that the environmental, social and financial risks involved with the entire lifecycle of coal from mining, to production to export are likely to grow even more acute over time. It urges banks to shift financing toward clean energy and plan for a carbon constrained future. Specific recommendations include phasing out lending to the largest producers of mountaintop removal coal, ensuring that coal financing deals commit banks and companies to emissions reductions and withholding financing for new coal export terminals.

Paris ",Kaliningrad Nuclear Plant: HypoVereinsbank follows BNP Paribas and pulls out. When will Coface and Société Générale follow suit?,BNP Paribas ,France,Baltic nuclear power plant- Kaliningrad ,energy plants - nuclear,Russian Federation,"
Following in the footsteps of BNP Paribas, the German HypoVereinsbank just announced that it will not finance the Kaliningrad nuclear power plant in Russia. Today, to mark the anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster, Friends of the Earth France launches the mobilization against this project in France with an online petition (1), supported by Greenpeace, the Nuclear Exit (""Sortir du nucléaire"") network, ATTAC and BankTrack, demanding that Coface and Société Générale follow their example immediately. In addition, 94 organisations from 22 countries have signed an open letter (2) in support of this goal, while the Russian NGO Ecodefense, currently undergoing an inspection by the Russian authorities, demonstrates in front of the offices of Société Générale's subsidiary in Kaliningrad. 
Following the announcement by BNP Paribas in December, the German bank HypoVereinsbank, a subsidiary of UniCredit, has now announced that it will not participate in the financing of a controversial new nuclear power plant in Kaliningrad. Located in the Russian enclave between Poland and Lithuania, the project aims to enter the European energy market by selling electricity to these neighbouring countries, although they have already stated their opposition to the project. Rosatom, the Russian company leading the project, is looking for an investor to take on 49% of the project, so far without success. In this context, Coface and Société Générale have been solicited for an export credit facility to fund Alstom turbines for this project.
It is not only the neighbouring countries, but also the local population that has been also opposed to the project since its inception. Vladimir Slivyak, from the Russian NGO Ecodefense, explains: ""On this Chernobyl Day, we call directly on Coface and Société Générale, by sending them an open letter signed by 94 organisations from 22 countries around the world, to ask them to abandon this project. This letter highlights the futility of the project, which does not meet local needs, and the fact that many inhabitants have been stopped by Rosatom and the Russian authorities from participating in public hearings, which is unacceptable. The project's Environmental Impact Assessment does not comply with Russian legal norms, and remains unsatisfactory on many issues including waste management, reactor decommissioning and impacts of a major nuclear accident. We will demonstrate today in front of the Société Générale subsidiary here in Kaliningrad. (3)""
Russia is well-known for its lack of nuclear safety. On this sad anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster, the consequences of this nuclear catastrophe are still tragically felt on the European continent. Many corruption scandals have also hit the Russian nuclear industry in the past few years. Russia also exerts more and more pressure on NGOs like Ecodefense, currently being inspected by the Russian authorities.


After a first meeting with Coface and Société Générale in March with Vladimir Slivyak's participation, Friends of the Earth France now launches the mobilization against this project. Yann Louvel, Climate and Energy Campaign Coordinator for the BankTrack network, concludes: ""We start today with the launch of a cyberaction (1), in collaboration with Cyberacteurs website, also supported by Greenpeace, the network ""Sortir du nucléaire"", ATTAC and BankTrack, to ask Coface and Société Générale to abandon this project. We invite all French citizens to take part in this cyberaction, to demand that these two financial institutions follow BNP Paribas and HypoVereinsbank and immediately abandon this project.""

Nijmegen ",NGOs warn banks not to further finance PNG LNG project,Crédit Mutuel ,France,Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) project ,oil and gas,Papua New Guinea,"
A coalition of seven NGOs (BankTrack, Jubilee Australia, Pacific Environment, Act Now! PNG, Mineral Policy Institute, International Accountability Project and Friends of the Earth France) today sent a letter to seventeen banks that are already involved in the financing of the highly controversial PNG LNG project to ask them not to extend any further financing to this project.
Despite a first warning letter more than three years ago, 17 banks decided to finance the PNG LNG project, the biggest project ever in the history of Papua New Guinea. Because of huge cost overruns (20% from US$14bn to US$19bn), due in part to the failure to anticipate local conflict, ExxonMobil is looking for a US$1.5bn additional debt facility to complete the project from the very same banks.
The letter stresses the key findings of the latest report by Jubilee Australia « PipeDreams : the PNG LNG Project and the future hopes of a nation » which reveals that « it is very likely that the project will exacerbate poverty, increase corruption and lead to more violence in the country ». It raises the critical issue of landowner identification and negotiation, for which the Equator Principles requirements have clearly been violated. The concrete risks of the Dutch disease syndrome (the relationship between the increase in exploitation of natural resources and a decline in the other economic sectors) now spreading are also one of the reasons for the opposition to this project, as well as the uneven local revenue distribution and the risks of further project-related conflicts.
Yann Louvel, Climate and Energy Campaign Coordinator for the BankTrack network, concludes: « The dangers of this project are worsening and we have already seen tensions and violence related to land disputes, employment and the allocation of the Business Development Grants. We urge the private banks involved not to extend further financing to this project ».

China ",Chinese Government Releases Guidelines for Overseas Investment,,,,,,"
On February 28th, 2013, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Environmental Protection released its ""Guidelines for Environmental Protection in Foreign Investment and Cooperation"" (""Guidelines""), which are based on recommendations by the Chinese NGO, Global Environmental Institute (GEI). These Guidelines provide civil society groups with a new source of leverage when it comes to holding Chinese companies responsible for their environmental and social impacts overseas. 

View the ""Guidelines for Environmental Protection in Foreign Investment and Cooperation"" in Burmese | Chinese | English | Spanish 
Read an analysis of the Guidelines by Grace Mang, China Program Director
Read a comparison of the Guidelines with international standards by Policy Director Peter Bosshard (also available in Chinese on chinadialogue)
Read interviews with Mr. Ren Peng of Global Environmental Institute and Dr. Hu Tao of the World Resources Institute

The Guidelines cover key issues, including legal compliance, environmental policies, environmental management plans, mitigation measures, disaster management plans, community relations, waste management, and international standards. 
While the Guidelines are non-binding, they are still government policy and can thus be a useful tool for civil society seeking to hold Chinese companies to account. Even though it is unlikely that the Guidelines will translate into immediate changes at project sites, the Guidelines create a new window for civil society to engage with Chinese companies abroad, obtain project information and documents, and hold them to a higher level of responsibility around mitigating damages.

Edinburgh ",RBS sustainability report shows deliberate manipulation of truth by the state-owned bank,Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS)  ,United Kingdom,,,,"
Commenting on an RBS sustainability report published last week (10th April 2013), Paul Daly, Corporate Accountability Campaigner, Friends of the Earth Scotland, said:
""One third of RBS energy lending still goes to climate-trashing projects. The report looks solely at project funding, which excludes loans to companies involved in tar sands, or corporations who get coal by blasting the tops off of mountains; decimating landscapes and releasing toxins that poison water and reportedly impact on human health.
""RBS claims this report moves towards better transparency. To achieve this RBS need to start accounting for their investment in climate trashing corporations as well as projects. Sir Philip Hampton recently reported to the Guardian that RBS has not funded tar sand projects in over four years - however today's report declares they still fund corporations who undertake these operations. This is a not lack of transparency, this is deliberate manipulation of fact.
""The problem with RBS's funding is that it still puts profit before people and planet - this is the mindset which historically got the bank into trouble. For RBS good investment doesn't equate with good environmental practice - that is not what we need from our state-owned bank.
Yann Louvel, Climate and Energy Campaign Coordinator for the BankTrack network, adds : ""RBS' new policy on power generation is very deceptive and falls far behind international best practices. Other international banks have adopted more stringent standards than RBS, which has still a long way to go to become, as CEO Stephen Hester has put it, 'a really good bank'"".
Paul Daly concludes : ""We call on RBS to dump its toxic debtors - sending out a strong message to the world that we are committed to renewable energy, not scraping the bottom of the fossil fuel barrel regardless of environmental or human cost.""

must crack down on anonymous company ownership, said Global Witness today
following revelations by the International Consortium of Investigative
Journalists (ICIJ) of the hidden offshore dealings of politicians, fraudsters
and the super-rich. 
The massive cache of
leaked documents demonstrates how hidden ownership of shell companies can
facilitate corruption, tax dodging and possibly worse.
Mr. Cameron has made a
welcome promise to make tax and financial transparency priority issues at the
meeting of G8 leaders in Northern Ireland this June.
Stuart McWilliam,
Campaigner at Global Witness said: ""This revelation of the extent of
financial secrecy should act as a wake-up call to us all. Hidden company
ownership enables corruption, state looting and dodgy deals that directly
deplete state budgets and entrench poverty. Arms traffickers, drug dealers, and
corrupt politicians all use shell companies to carry out their illicit
activity.""
""It is not just
offshore centres that facilitate this sort of secrecy. Lawyers, banks and
company service providers in the UK and US are expert at providing anonymity to
those who can pay,"" he added.
""By requiring the
names of the ultimate beneficial owners of all companies to be made public, G8
leaders could provide a huge boost to efforts to reduce corruption and
financial crime globally and to promote development worldwide. There is no
excuse for them not to act.""

Boston ",Experts Urge Bank of America to Phase Out Coal Investments,Bank of America ,United States,,,,"
A letter released
today by Rainforest Action Network and signed by 50 financial, environmental
and legal experts urges Bank of America to demonstrate leadership on climate
and public health by restricting its investments in the coal industry. Signatories on
the letter include Rebecca Henderson of Harvard Business School, Noam Chomsky
from MIT, Bill McKibben, 350.org founder, Tedd Saunders from the Saunders Hotel
Group and 19 investment firms.
A delegation of five signatories will deliver the
letter to Bank of America at noon today at 100 Federal Street in downtown
Boston.
Bank of America's top executive officers, including
CEO Brian Moynihan, are headquartered in Boston. The city is also a leading
socially responsible investment (SRI) hub. Signatories on today's letter
represent some of the largest and most well respected SRI asset managers in the
business, with $3.74 trillion in assets under management.
""Bank of America has a unique opportunity to shift
energy financing to support clean, renewable power generation and reduce
climate change risks in its operations,"" said Susan Baker, Vice President,
Shareholder Advocacy & Corporate Engagement, Trillium Asset Management, LLC.
""Squandering that opportunity shortchanges investors, economic growth and the
future of our planet.""  
Bank of America is the leading financier of U.S. coal,
the top contributor to climate change pollution in the country. It invested at
least $6.4 billion across the sector in the past two years, according to
Bloomberg data. The bank funds every aspect of the industry, from coal-fired
power plants to mountaintop removal mining operations in Appalachia to export
terminal developments in the Pacific Northwest.
""As a philanthropist, I appreciate the complexities of
putting money to work for the greater social good,"" said Farhad Ebrahimi,
founder of the Chorus Foundation. ""Bank of America has made some impressive
commitments to financing a low carbon economy, but those commitments are
undermined by the bank's investments in dirty coal. Only by aligning all of our
investments will we see the changes that we so desperately need.""
Today's letter delivery to Bank of America illustrates
the increasing opposition to the continued extraction and use of coal energy
for health, environmental, climate and financial reasons.
""The Boston investment community is taking a big step
forward by calling on Bank of America to end its leading role in financing coal
and instead demonstrate leadership in the transition to a clean energy
economy,"" said Vanessa Green, a lifetime Boston resident and campaigner with
Rainforest Action Network. ""Simply put, we cannot solve the climate crisis
while the nation's largest banks continue to prop up the coal industry.""
The letter urges the bank to address specific elements
in a renewed coal policy, including that the bank phase out financing for
companies pursuing new coal-fired power plants and life extending retrofits,
companies that operate mountaintop removal mines, and companies pursuing new
coal export infrastructure. The letter asserts:
""Signatories to this letter include long-term
investors of diversified portfolios whose holdings in many respects are
representative of the global economy. As a result, investors have a clear
financial interest in the enduring health of capital markets and the economy.
Coal combustion and its links to negative environmental and health impacts
present real risks to investors and bolster the argument for stronger
protections of public health and welfare.""
Rainforest Action Network's Energy and Finance program
combines policy analysis with a national campaign to expose the risks of financing
coal while promoting the transition toward a clean energy economy. The
organization has achieved more than a dozen landmark policy commitments from
America's largest corporations including Disney, Citi, Home Depot, Goldman
Sachs, Kinko's, Boise and Lowe's.

",Why the World Bank must end its support for palm oil in Honduras,,,Bajo Aguan Valley Palm Oil Plantation ,agriculture - palm oil ,Honduras,"
In a press release issued
 yesterday by Friends of the Earth International, we asked for 
cancellation of a World Bank loan to Honduran palm oil producer Grupo 
Dinant. Here's why:
Around the world, the palm oil industry is fast becoming recognized 
as a ""leader"" in ecological destruction and human rights abuse. Some of 
the companies drawing most attention are huge Indonesian and Malaysian 
firms, including Wilmar International and Sime Darby. Wilmar has been involved in such repeated abuses that institutional investors like the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund have dropped their stocks from its portfolio, while Sime Darby, whose abuses are equally grave, may be next on the list.
But palm oil is an equal-opportunity market that relies on cheap 
labor and large expanses of land to turn a profit. As such, small-ish 
players in small countries are just as capable as the large global firms
 in wreaking havoc.
Grupo Dinant in Honduras is one such company, whose track record of 
violence and land grabbing implicates it in some of the most serious 
abuses of human rights in Central America today. The company, owned by a
 single wealthy individual, runs a virtual terror campaign to ensure 
control of a large swath of land in the Lower Aguan Valley near the 
Caribbean coast of Honduras. I visited the area years ago, and wrote about it in 2011, when a recent surge of killings brought to light the fact that the company was actually receiving Certified Emissions Credits under the United Nations Clean Development Mechanism.
As Friends of the Earth International and allied NGOs made clear in a press release yesterday, the violence and impunity continue. Today, with 89 peasant 
farmers dead in the Aguan Valley, Grupo Dinant is in the spotlight 
again, as the World Bank's International Finance Corporation (IFC), 
which has loaned $30 million to the company, has requested that Dinant 
hire an international security consultant assess its security program 
and to provide training for the company's security forces.
The memo from IFC says that the consultant will ""work with Dinant to develop a Corporate 
Security Policy and Code of Ethics based on the UN Voluntary Principles 
for Business and Human Rights (VPBHR)."" But given that Dinant's security
 force consists of known paramilitaries, and given the track record of 
abuse and impunity in the region, retraining them to respect human 
rights is akin to training pit bulls to act like poodles by putting pink
 ribbons on them. That is, it's a distraction, and a dangerous one.
Dinant's oil palm plantations have been at the center of land 
conflicts dating back to the 1970s. Despite a long history of conflict, 
the IFC paid the first of two $15 million loan installments to Grupo 
Dinant in November, 2009 - shortly after a military coup had ousted the democratically elected president. The coup was publicly supported by Grupo Dinant's CEO, Miguel Facusse. 
Since the coup, Dinant and another palm oil company have been implicated in the murder of dozens of peasants. Killings
 are continuing with complete impunity, the region around the 
plantations has been heavily militarized, and long-standing peasant 
communities have been violently evicted. Yet the World Bank's loan assessment -
 updated last month - claims: ""Dinant understands the importance of 
having good relationships with their neighboring communities and are 
quite proactive in this regard.""
The recent statement from the IFC follows on an audit from the IFC's own Compliance Advisor/Ombudsman (CAO) which states that
 that ""IFC's performance in relation to this project merited further 
enquiry,"" including consideration of  ""whether IFC policies and 
procedures provide adequate guidance to staff on how to manage social 
risks associated with Projects  in areas that are subject to 
conflict or conflict.""
The CAO exists thanks to years of civil society demands, and while it
 is laudable that the body is taking the case seriously, the 
bureaucratic language masks a grim reality. The IFC's response - 
retraining thugs to quit being thugs - would be laughable, were it not 
for the lives involved.
In 2011, FIAN, an international NGO working for food rights, produced a report on human rights violations in Bajo Aguán, documenting ""evidence of the involvement of private security forces hired by Dinant and other companies owned by Miguel Facussé in human rights abuses and, in particular, in the murder of peasants in Bajo Aguán.""
 When the report was brought to the German development bank DEG, the 
Bank confirmed FIAN's findings and canceled a $20 million loan to 
Dinant.
Still, the violence continued, supported by the IFC.
A 2012 public hearing on the human rights situation in the peasant communities of the lower Aguán concluded that the agrarian conflict there is the ""most serious situation in terms of violence against peasants in Central America in the last fifteen years.""
Still, the violence continued, supported by the IFC.
The IFC's statement says that the agency ""has engaged with the 
company and government to help identify a peaceful solution,"" that 
""Grupo Dinant is cooperating with its investigations,"" and that ""the 
company's approach is to handle land claims and occupations through the 
Honduran courts.""
None of this considers the fact - well-evidenced through years of 
independent investigation - that the company is, in fact, the aggressor,
 and that the government of Honduras cannot be expected to reign in a 
company run by one of the country's most powerful and well-connected 
individuals.  
Does the World Bank really expect that security forces who have acted
 with impunity on behalf of a company that is closely allied with the 
illegitimate coup government of Honduras can be retrained to respect 
human rights?  
At best, you'll get them to do a better job of burying their victims 
and their crimes, and carrying on with business as usual - which, 
ultimately, may be all that the IFC really wants to do.

Laos ",Fish Passages A Poor Match for Mekong Dams’ Impacts,,,Xayaburi dam ,energy plants - dams,Laos,"
From March 2013 World Rivers Review
The start of construction of the Xayaburi Dam on the Mekong River in Laos sets off a dangerous game of Russian roulette with the world's largest inland fishery.
As the first project in a cascade of 11 hydropower dams to be built on the Lower Mekong River's mainstream, the dam is expected to block the migration route of between 23 and 100 fish species, while adversely impacting the livelihoods and food security of more than 200,000 people. The dam's proponents claim that a state-of-the-art fish ladder, designed by the Finnish and Swiss companies Pöyry and Terraplant, will allow migrating fish to safely pass through the dam. 
Yet fishery experts in the Mekong region have challenged this claim, stating that no technology currently exists to effectively mitigate the impacts caused by the mainstream dams due to the wide diversity of migrating fish species and the large numbers of fish that migrate at peak times. A 2011 scientific study published in Environmental Management warned that a serious effort to minimize impacts from the mainstream dams would take decades of research on the biological requirements of key migratory species to ensure that specialized fish passage facilities actually meet the needs of this diverse fishery . 
In its 2011 review of Pöyry's work, the Mekong River Commission recommended a less-conservative plan, stating that construction on the Xayaburi Dam be delayed at least two years, so that fishery baseline data could be collected, analyzed and incorporated into the final design of the dam.  
Instead of heeding the recommendations of these experts, Laos has continued to move forward with construction, with the project's coffer dam expected to be completed as early as May.
Yet if any lessons are to be drawn from the experience of dam building in the Mekong River Basin, it's that fish passages offer false promises. In the nearby Mun River, an important tributary of the Mekong, the Pak Mun Dam's fish passage has been viewed by experts as a total failure, as less than a quarter of the river's fish species successfully pass through the passage. 
In a 2001 review of the failures of the Pak Mun Dam's fish passage, fishery expert Tyson R. Roberts warned that solving the problem of dams creating a barrier to fish migration is only the first step in attempting to mitigate the impacts of dams on fisheries. Roberts cautioned: ""What use is a fish ladder ... enabling fish to move from one extremely unfavorable set of environmental conditions downstream (in the reservoir outflow) to a totally different but also unfavorable set of environmental conditions upstream (in the reservoir)?"" 
The reality is, there are no successful examples of fish passages in the region to draw from, nor even in another tropical country. With so much at stake for the Mekong River's fisheries and its people, the game of Russian roulette on the Xayaburi Dam must stop.  Construction on the project should be halted until proven solutions are put forward to protect the Mekong's abundant fisheries from the impacts of the mainstream dams.

Washington DC ",World Bank must end support for Honduran palm oil company implicated in dozens of murders,,,Bajo Aguan Valley Palm Oil Plantation ,agriculture - palm oil ,Honduras,"
International
 NGOs have condemned a statement by the World Bank's International 
Finance Corporation,  which defends the record of a Honduran palm oil
 company, Grupo Dinant, which is implicated in dozens of murders as well
 as other human rights abuses. The IFC statement explicitly admits to 
supporting training for the company's armed security guards. A World 
Bank Ombudsman  is currently investigating an IFC loan of $30 million
 for Grupo Dinant which was approved in 2009, at least half of which has
 already been disbursed. This month, an Open Letter by 17 NGOs  and 
an international petition signed by over 63,000 people  have 
protested the loan and called on the World Bank to immediately cease 
their support for Grupo Dinant.
Since 2009, international human rights bodies have documented dozens 
of murders of peasant activists and their supporters in connection with 
land conflicts involving Grupo Dinant, the company's armed security 
guards and Honduran military and police. The evidence includes a 
fact-finding mission report by international human rights organisations 
in March 2011, a hearing before the Inter-American Commission of Human 
Rights in October 2011, an international public hearing on human rights 
in the region in May 2012  and a report about human rights abuses 
attributed to military forces in the region by Rights Action, published 
this month . The recent Rights Action report confirms that at least 
88 members and supporters of peasant movements have been murdered in 
targeted killings in the Bajo Aguan Valley over the past three years. It
 documents the direct involvement of Grupo Dinant's armed security 
forces in the violence against peasant movements. Contrary to the World 
Bank's claims that the violence ended in 2012, two peasant activists 
were found tortured and murdered in February 2013. 
Annie Bird from Rights Action says: ""It is a serious indictment of 
World Bank's role in Honduras's land conflicts that their International 
Finance Corporation admits to directly engaging with the training of 
Grupo Dinant's paramilitary ‘security guards'. It is not clear whether 
this engagement is a response to concerns over human rights abuses but 
retraining paramilitaries implicated in killings is never an acceptable 
response. The World Bank must cease such engagement and stop supporting 
Grupo Dinant at once.""
Almuth Ernsting from Global Forest Coalition and Biofuelwatch adds: 
""The World Bank's claims that killings are being investigated by 
Honduran courts with full cooperation from Grupo Dinant contradict the 
findings of human rights missions which show a state of total impunity 
surrounding those murders. Such a state of impunity has been confirmed 
by the UN Working Group on Mercenaries. Not only must the World Bank 
cancel its loan but there needs to be a full investigation into their 
role in human rights abuses in Honduras.""
In 2011, the German development bank, DEG, cancelled a loan for Grupo
 Dinant due to the company's involvement in serious human rights 
abuses.Yet the World Bank continues to back the company and dismiss all 
independent evidence, as their recent statement shows.
Jeff Conant from Friends of the Earth U.S. adds: ""The World Bank's 
statement on Bajo Aguan reveals the extent of their complicity with a 
palm oil company implicated in some of the most serious human rights 
abuses in Central America today. Years after a damning audit of their 
palm oil funding and a supposed overhaul of their policies, the World 
Bank is legitimizing the use of armed paramilitaries in land conflicts 
against peasants who are trying to reclaim their own land, dismissing a 
vast volume of evidence from independent fact finding missions.""
The NGOs demand cancellation of the World Bank's loan to Grupo Dinant
 and an immediate full and independent investigation into the World 
Bank's involvement with Grupo Dinant, which must go beyond the remit of 
the current Ombudsman investigation.

Altamira, Brazil ",Human Trafficking and Prostitution Scandal Threatens Belo Monte Dam,,,Belo Monte dam ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"
Brazil's Parliamentary Commission on Human Trafficking (CPI)
announced yesterday that it will summon the president of the Belo Monte
dam-building consortium Norte Energia to explain its relationship to a
nightclub, located within the dam's work camp, where 18 young women and an
adolescent girl were held hostage and forced to prostitute themselves before
being freed last month. Should CPI's inquiry demonstrate that Norte Energia
shares responsibility for the crimes of human trafficking and sexual slavery, the
construction of the world's third largest dam on the Amazon's Xingu River could
be immediately suspended pending the implementation of rigorous
socio-environmental mitigation measures.
The human trafficking scandal broke in mid-February when a
16 year-old girl escaped from a nightclub and denounced that she and several
others from southern Brazil had been held as sex slaves in abysmal living
conditions after being lured with offers for jobs in Altamira from their native
town of Santa Catarina. After the girl's escape, police arrested the
nightclub's owners and guards, and a congressional inquiry was opened.
According to Congressman Arnaldo Jordy, president of the CPI
on Human Trafficking, the location of the nightclub within Belo Monte's public
land concession indicates that the Norte Energia consortium could have played a
role in this crime and will have to make immediate amends. In addition, the CPI
inquiry will summons representatives from Brazil's National Development Bank
(BNDES), and the public banks Caixa Económica and Banco do Brasil to evaluate
the ""social damages"" caused by the projects they are financing, such
as Belo Monte.
""It's impossible that the company has no type of
culpability. This brothel is on the side of the only road inside the work camp.
We cannot accept this kind of complicity,"" said Mr. Jordy. ""Whatever
explanation is offered, whatever the defense presented by the consortium, we
will evaluate the possibilities, among them to suspend the project until
conditionalities are observed.""
Since the construction of the Belo Monte dam began, tens of
thousands of migrants have arrived in the city of Altamira in search of work,
more than doubling the city's population from 90 thousand in 2010 to nearly 200
thousand today. In order to mitigate the detrimental impacts of this population
boom, Norte Energia was mandated by the Brazilian federal government to comply
with a rigorous set of socio-environmental actions prior to initiating the
project's construction.
The chaotic migration has placed enormous strain on the
city's social services and infrastructure, while leading to an explosion in
violent crime, especially against women and girls. Since the project broke
ground in 2011, the number of child victims of violence and sexual exploitation
in Altamira has nearly tripled.
""Unfortunately human trafficking and sex abuses are
considered a regular consequence of projects like this,"" said Maira
Irigaray of nonprofit Amazon Watch. ""Cases at sites Tucurui and Madeira
were never even exposed. Brazilian authorities, construction companies and
financers must be held accountable because they are responsible for these
horrific abuses against women and girls.""
""The latest scandals are part of a larger pattern
within the Amazon dam industry, in which profit maximization and corruption
constantly override concerns for human dignity and environmental
protection,"" said Brent Millikan, Amazon Program Director of International
Rivers. ""According to Brazilian legislation, however, public financial institutions
such as BNDES can be held legally responsible for the social and environmental
damage that is already being caused by Belo Monte.""
By summoning representatives of Belo Monte's principal
project financiers BNDES, Caixa Económica and Banco do Brasil for questioning,
the CPI inquiry could also aim to make these institutions accountable for the
serious social damages being caused by the mega-dam's construction. BNDES is
financing 80% of Belo Monte's US$15 billion price tag (31 billion reais). In November of 2012, BNDES approved a 22.5 billion reais project loan, 7 billion of which is to be passed through by Caixa Económica, and 2 billion of which is to be passed through by BTG Pactual. "

United States ","Arch Coal, the Blair Mountain Battlefield, and Bank Human Rights Commitments",,,Mountain top removal coal mining ,mining - coal ,United States,"
RAN's March 2013 Coal Risk Update focuses on the
potential human rights impacts of Arch Coal's proposed Adkins Fork mountaintop
removal mine in Blair, West Virginia. If approved, this mine would destroy the
heart of a historically significant battlefield site and would also have severe
impacts on the environment and human health.
The update finds that several banks that lend to Arch
Coal may be doing so in violation of both their own human rights commitments
and emerging human rights norms for the private sector:

 Potential water, noise, and
air pollution impacts from the mine will likely violate the human rights to
water and health of residents of Blair, WV.


Arch's past mining
operations near Blair that, according to testimony of Arch officials,
""would make life so miserable for many Blair residents that they would
want to sell their homes and move"" implicate the right to housing.


Human rights norms also
proscribe the intentional destruction of cultural heritage sites such as the
Blair Mountain battlefield.

RAN recommends that Arch's lenders reassess their
financial ties to Arch and strengthen their human rights due diligence
mechanisms, for effective human rights risk management is no longer
""optional"" for banks:

Six of the nine banks
involved with Arch's most recent corporate loan have committed to avoid
transactions that pose significant human rights risks.


Seven of these banks have
committed to the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative's
""precautionary approach"" to addressing the social and environmental
impacts of the financial sector.

Paris ",Kaliningrad: Are France and Societe Generale responsible for double standards in nuclear safety?,Société Générale ,France,Baltic nuclear power plant- Kaliningrad ,energy plants - nuclear,Russian Federation,"
After meeting with Coface and Societe Generale, potential financiers of the Kaliningrad nuclear power plant in Russia through the export finance of Alstom turbines, Friends of the Earth France and Greenpeace France denounce this geopolitical project, due to the enormous risks involved (economics, corruption, human rights, waste management) and the strong local opposition. They ask the French State and Societe Generale to draw lessons from Fukushima, stop their doublespeak and refuse to finance this project immediately, as BNP Paribas has already done.
Announced in 2008, the Kaliningrad nuclear power plant project, located in the Russian enclave between Poland and Lithuania, was officially launched in 2010, and Rosatom started work on the site last year. Presented as an answer to the forecast growing electricity needs locally, this project is in fact above all geopolitical, aimed at allowing Russia to break into the European energy market by selling electricity from the plant to neighbouring countries. The problem is that these countries have already expressed their opposition to the project and refuse to import this electricity, stressing the economic risks of the venture.
The project is also being confronted with a strong local opposition, explains Vladimir Slivyak, from the Ecodefense association, visiting Paris this week: ""The majority of the local population is opposed to the project since its beginning - 67% according to a poll conducted in 2007. Our opposition first led to the cancellation of the project before it was brought back on the table in 2008. We have been totally mobilized against the project since then, and have asked four times to organize a local referendum, in vain. Some of us were even stopped from participating in the consultations on the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) by local authorities and Rosatom in 2009"". This EIA also raises many issues: it did not seriously address the possible alternatives to this nuclear power plant, only partially addressed the waste management issue, and did not address the decommissioning issue or the potential impacts of a major nuclear accident. In addition it has not been submitted to the populations of neighbouring countries, despite their close proximity (the Lithuanian border is only 10km from the site).
Despite these concerns, the French State could still guarantee this project through Coface, and Societe Generale could provide finance in the form of export finance for Alstom turbines, explains Sophia Majnoni, nuclear campaigner for Greenpeace France: ""When you add the omnipresent corruption risks in Russia and the fact that the design of the reactors has not been assessed by an independent safety authority in the European Union, you understand that the French government is using doublespeak when it discusses the lessons to draw from Fukushima, and is promoting a double standard in nuclear safety for political reasons. By exporting nuclear risks abroad, to a country that has already had to cope with the Chernobyl catastrophe, a guarantee by Coface on this project would be the ultimate symbol of this incoherence"".
Yann Louvel, climate and energy campaign coordinator for the BankTrack network, concludes: ""In our meeting with Coface and Societe Generale on the 5th March, we asked them to renounce this project immediately. The project does not meet the criteria in the bank's own nuclear sector policy. The risks are so high that other financial players, including BNP Paribas, have already decided not to finance this project. The French State and Societe Generale have to draw the lessons from Fukushima and follow their example."" "

Brussels ",It is time the EU scraps its carbon Emissions Trading System,,,,,,"
A growing group of civil society organisations, BankTrack included, is calling on the EU to abolish its Emission Trading System (ETS) to open space for truly effective climate policies. Today they release a joint declaration that highlights the many structural loopholes the ETS is facing, that the proposed reform proposals put forward by EU policy makers will not be able to fix. Tomorrow (19 Feb.) the Environmental Committee of the European Parliament will vote on the Commission's backloading proposal. ""Although advertised as a way to fix the failing ETS, it is nothing but a drop in the ocean. The EU's flagship policy to address climate change has diverted attention from the need to transform the system's dependency on fossil fuels and growing consumption, resulting in increased emissions. After seven lost years, it's time to make space for effective and fair climate policies,"" says Joanna Cabello, from Carbon Trade Watch. More than 90 organisations, networks and movements from all over the world launch today the joint declaration 'It is Time to Scrap the ETS'. It lists the structural flaws of the ETS and the risks of trying to fix it. One of the flaws is the use of offset projects which allows companies or governments from the North to buy credits from a project in the South instead of reducing emissions at source. ""The offset projects under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), the biggest offset scheme, has actually increased emissions while causing land grabs and human rights violations, community displacements, conflicts and increased local environmental destruction,"" says Isaac Rojas, from Friends of the Earth Latin America and Caribbean (ATALC). ""Other new market mechanisms and related financial products (such as forest carbon offsets and biodiversity offsets) follow the same logic which allows, and offsets, deforestation, forest degradation, biodiversity loss and water pollution,"" he adds. In spite of the growing evidence of the problems, offset use in the ETS grew by 85% in 2011. Furthermore, the EU ETS is costing the public a lot of money without serving a public purpose. Belen Balanyá, from Corporate Europe Observatory says: ""At a time when EU citizens are shouldering the cost of the economic crisis, they are also being forced to bear the cost of the legislation, regulation and much of the quantification of emissions that carbon markets require, as well as the costs of measures against fraud, theft, corruption, and tax evasion. Meanwhile big polluters such as Arcellor Mittal and Lafarge make millions of windfall profits with over allocated permits.""  The EU ETS created the biggest carbon market in the world and now serves as a model for other countries. China is setting up a system with EU support and is planning to link it to the EU ETS. Other countries and regions such as Brazil, Korea, Australia, California in the US and Quebec in Canada have similar plans. The failures of the ETS will also be exported to other areas, as it will be used as a model for trading other ‘ecosystem services' such as forests, biodiversity, water, soils and landscapes. In the meantime, civil society groups from around the world are demanding to scrap the ETS so that market mechanisms stop being used as a model for environmental protection. The organisations supporting this declaration conclude: ""It is time to stop fixating on ‘price' as a driver for change. We need to scrap the ETS and implement effective and fair climate policies by making the necessary transition away from fossil fuel dependency.""

London ",Barclays ends food speculation that made up to £278 million in 2012,Barclays ,United Kingdom,,,,"
 
Barclays, which announced an end to its speculation on food on Tuesday, made up to an estimated £278 million from the trade in 2012. The figure brings the bank's total revenue from food speculation from 2010 to 2012 to an estimated three quarters of a billion pounds.
The bank has pulled out of speculative deals with hedge funds. Campaigners welcome this move but are disappointed by its decision to continue selling investment products that allow other financial players, like pension funds, to speculate.
The £278 million figure was released today by the World Development Movement, which is calling for regulation to prevent banks betting on food prices and contributing to the global hunger crisis.
Barclays has been the leading UK player in speculating on food. Goldman Sachs is widely recognised as the world leader.
Barclays' withdrawal follows announcements in 2012 by several German, Austrian and Scandinavian banks that they would reduce or suspend trading in food commodity markets. But German giant Deutsche Bank, one of the banks indicating a withdrawal, has since returned to speculating on food.
Legislation to curb speculation is on the table at the EU, but the UK government has so far opposed effective controls.
World Development Movement campaigner Christine Haigh said today:

""Barclays' announcement is a welcome step. One of the world's biggest banks has acknowledged that gambling on food is not an acceptable way to make money, and other speculators like Goldman Sachs should take heed. But Barclays remains in the market peddling investment products which enable others to speculate on food prices, and could return to larger scale speculation at any time. The only thing that will prevent banks driving up prices is tough regulation, and this is what the UK government should be supporting.""

Phnom Penh ",Cambodia’s Lower Sesan 2 Dam’s Draft Law Evades Costs and Concerns,,,Lower Sesan 2 dam ,energy plants - dams,Cambodia,"
Phnom Penh: Cambodian lawmakers are set to debate a new draft law for the controversial Lower Sesan 2 Hydropower Dam at this Friday’s National Assembly session.  The draft law offers government guarantees to the project developers in the event that Electricité du Cambodge fails to pay for the electricity it has promised to purchase or in case of a political force majeure that would affect the project developer’s interests. The law is based on an implementation agreement between the government and Hydropower Lower Sesan 2 Company Ltd that has significantly reduced the project’s compensation and environmental management costs. If approved, the law will help the implementation agreement to go into effect, thereby releasing the project developer from responsibility for many of the dam’s environmental and social impacts.
The new law claims that the Lower Sesan 2 Dam will affect less than 800 households in northeastern Cambodia.  In contrast, a study entitled “Best Practices in Compensation and Resettlement for Large Dams” indicated that tens to hundreds of thousands of people living upstream and downstream of the project in Cambodia, and within the region, who will experience negative impacts to their livelihoods and food security.  
The Lower Sesan 2 Dam is expected to have significant transboundary impacts in the Mekong River Basin. In 2012, a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences concluded that the dam will wipe out 9 percent of the Mekong Basin’s fish biomass.  The International Centre for Environmental Management, which has studied sediment flows in the region, was quoted in the Cambodia Daily newspaper as saying that the dam is expected to reduce 6-8 percent of the Basin’s sediments loads which are essential to the productivity of the Mekong Delta, riverbank gardens and other floodplains.  Research published in 2012 by the Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management found that the full hydropower development of the Sesan, Srepok and Sekong rivers, including the Lower Sesan 2 Dam, will significantly alter  water levels in the Tonle Sap Lake and will have a higher impact on the Lake than the Upper Mekong hydropower cascade in China.  
“As one of the worst proposed dams in the Lower Mekong Basin, the Lower Sesan 2 will unleash irreversible environmental destruction and harm to the food security of the nation.  It would be irresponsible for the National Assembly to approve this draft law and proceed with the project,” said Ms. Ame Trandem, Southeast Asia Program Director for International Rivers. “This dam threatens to undermine the country’s development.” 
Ms. Trandem added, “It’s clear that this dam should not proceed, as the company continues to evade the project’s real costs and has failed to consider the demands of affected communities who have repeatedly called for the project’s cancellation.”
During a visit last week to five villages that will be directly and indirectly affected by the Lower Sesan 2 Dam in Stung Treng province, International Rivers found that people have not been adequately consulted and lack basic information about the project and its compensation plan.  Immediately downstream of the dam site in Pluk Village, villagers have been informed that they will have to move to a safe zone and live in tents while the dam is being constructed.  People are unaware of whether they would receive any compensation for the disruption to their livelihoods during this move. In Srekor Village, which would be flooded by the reservoir, people are unclear when they will have to move and whether they will be entitled to new homes or infrastructure in the resettlement site.  Nearly all people interviewed were never consulted on the project and stated that they don’t want the dam to be built or to have to move away from their homes.
“National Assembly members would be wise to demand more studies and consider alternative energy technologies rather than gamble with Cambodia’s future on such a risky project,” continued Ms. Trandem.  “The benefits this project will bring to the country are negligible, especially when scientific research is showing just the opposite.” "

Paris ",New guidance notes on energy by ORSE: Falling short of the mark!,,,,,,"
ORSE, the Study Centre for Corporate Social Responsibility, which gathers major players of the financing of the French economy and abroad, published yesterday its new guidance notes on the energy sector aimed to inspire sector policies for French banks and insurers (1). For Friends of the Earth France, while these guidance notes are a first step, they are largely insufficient and far from FoE France's demands. The necessary energy transition will not happen if banks continue to finance new coal fired power plants, unconventional fossil fuels projects, huge dams or nuclear power plants unabated, the environmental and social impacts of which become ever more disastrous. These activities need to be excluded from financing, and French financial players' ""financed emissions"" need to decrease significantly, as fast as possible.
The adoption of sector policies in the energy sector has been a priority demand of FoE France since the publication of the report ""French Banks, Fossil Banks?"" in 2007 (2). Major French banks, notably BNP Paribas, Société Générale and Crédit Agricole, were at first far behind other international banks, but have progressively adopted energy sector policies in the past few years. The adoption of these guidance notes in the energy sector by ORSE, aimed to inspire such policies in other banks as well as insurers and asset managers in France, is then a first step in the right direction.
The ORSE guidelines, however, very much resemble the latest sector policies adopted by French banks, and are, like the sector policies, wholly insufficient. Viviana Varin, campaigner on finance sector responsibility for FoE France, explains where the problem lies: ""The wording of these guidance notes is deceiving. The presentation of the issues is highly biased, the vocabulary often vague, and the numerous loopholes leave much room for interpretation, making these notes a real Swiss cheese. Moreover, the selection or exclusion criteria do not live up to the stated ambition of ""reflecting current best practices in the market"" since many of those best practices are actually missing in the guidance notes. The improvements mentioned are unfortunately timid, such as the reference to the criteria of the World Commission on Dams for the hydroelectric sector, mentioned only as ""recommendation"" and not an obligation for new projects in the South"".
But the main issue lies in the continued distaste of French financial institutions for the complete exclusion of dodgy activities. Yann Louvel, Climate and Energy Campaign Coordinator for the BankTrack network, concludes: ""Rather than excluding the sectors and activities that have the most negative impacts on the climate, the environmental or living conditions of local communities, such as coal fired power plants, tar sands projects, oil projects in the Arctic or nuclear power plants, these guidance notes try to come up with acceptable criteria which are unfortunately totally insufficient. For BankTrack, such unconventional fossil fuels projects or nuclear projects cannot be ""responsible"" by nature. French banks have not drawn the lessons from the latest catastrophes in this sector, starting with the Fukushima disaster. They must adopt full exclusion of these false solutions to the climate and environmental crises, and reduce their financed emissions as fast as possible not to be involved any more in many dodgy deals around the world.""

Tokyo ",Japan utilities at risk unless they adapt to changed market forces,,,,,,"
The value of Japan's energy utilities, which slumped in the aftermath of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, will fall further if the companies continue to ignore major changes in market forces and regulations, a new Greenpeace report warns.
The report 'Beyond Nuclear: The triple challenge facing Japanese utilities', identifies three main issues the industry faces: a new wave of market deregulation, the devaluation of nuclear assets and breakthroughs in the deployment of renewables - and recommends changes that could boost the fortunes of Japan's utilities.
""The Fukushima disaster has broken the back of the traditional energy industry in Japan. The combination of the three main challenges our report highlights, aggravated by shrinking electricity demand and volatile coal, oil and LNG prices can stifle recovery if the utilities don't quickly adapt their business models,"" said Gyorgy Dallos, Greenpeace International energy investments advisor.
Published today, the Greenpeace report notes that the share prices of Japan's 10 major utilities plummeted after the Fukushima disaster and have not recovered. Fukushima nuclear plant owner TEPCO lead the decline, while the shares of non-nuclear Okinawa Electric Power fell the least.
Despite the victory of the pro-nuclear LDP party at the national election in December, utility share prices were still 22-89% below March 2011 levels on February 1, 2013, significantly underperforming Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 Index, which has recovered to above pre-Fukushima levels.
The Greenpeace report outlines a range of strategies, successfully used in other markets, that can guide the evolution of Japan's utilities. They must increase the flexibility of their electricity generation, improve the efficiency of existing thermal generation, reduce peak demand and volatility and learn how to benefit from the blossoming renewable revolution and Feed-in-Tariffs.
To boost their financial positions, the report also recommends that the utilities consider floating a minority share in their transmission-distribution assets.
""The good times are over for Japan's nuclear utilities. They can forget the days of market dominance and high profitability. But they can learn to be successful in a harsher environment and become less exposed to political changes and market risks,"" said Dallos.

",Selenium contamination risk at Alpha's MTR sites,,,Alpha Natural Resources ,mining - coal ,United States,"
In February 2013, a Rainforest Action Network Coal Risk Update warned of Alpha Natural Resources's exposure to litigation risk from selenium contamination at its MTR sites. The report noted that Alpha's violation history exposed it to significant financial risks from litigation,regulatory enforcement, and the immense cost of installing selenium filtering equipment at mine outfalls. Since the report's publication, six additional selenium contamination lawsuits have been filed against Alpha by citizens and environmental groups, in addition to four similar lawsuits filed prior to 2013. In March 2014, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Justice reached a settlement with Alpha over water contamination at 79 mine sites, which included several MTR mines. As part of the settlement, Alpha agreed to pay a $27.5 million penalty-the largest ever issued by the EPA for Clean Water Act-related pollution discharge violations-and agreed to spend $200 million to remediate pollution at its mine sites. The company's legal woes over water pollution continued in April 2014, when a federal judge ruled in favour of environmental groups in one of the selenium contamination lawsuits against the company.

San Francisco ",Selenium Risk at Alpha Natural Resources' Mountaintop Removal Mines,,,Mountain top removal coal mining ,mining - coal ,United States,"
This is the first installment in a new series of research updates by the Rainforest Action Network on the environmental and social risks involved with investment in the coal industry. These updates will highlight emerging risks facing companies involved with coal extraction, processing, or combustion.
In this update, we analyze environmental compliance risks at Alpha Natural Resources related to selenium emissions at the company's surface mines.
The report's key findings include the following:

Alpha Natural Resources faces several ongoing environmental lawsuits at its surface mines in Appalachia, including five separate lawsuits filed in 2012 alleging selenium contamination from mine water discharges.
Selenium compliance costs at surface mines can be significant.Selenium remediation expenditures at the surface mines at one of Alpha's peers, Patriot Coal contributed to a fivefold increase in the company's asset retirement obligations from $134 million to $743 million between 2007 and 2012.
Selenium emissions at Alpha's surface mines may pose risks for investors. West Virginia regulatory enforcement data indicates that Alpha's selenium compliance record raises concerns for investors in light of the company's exposure to selenium-related lawsuits.
The bankruptcy of Patriot Coal illustrates the danger of managing selenium compliance in the courtroom rather than in the boardroom.Improved disclosure by Alpha would enable investors to better understand its selenium-related litigation risks and compliance strategy.

Laos ",Mekong Countries at Odds Over Mega-Dams,,,Xayaburi dam ,energy plants - dams,Laos,"
Originally published in the Fair Observer.
Governments are struggling to decide whether the Mekong River should continue to feed 60 million people or become a source of hydroelectric power.
What started as a debate about a hydroelectric dam has become a high profile dispute over the future of food security in the Mekong region. The controversial Xayaburi Dam in Laos has resulted in increasing political tensions and a crackdown on civil society, culminating in the disappearance of a Lao activist in December.
Over 60 million people living in Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam depend on the Mekong River. It is the world’s largest inland fishery and the second most biodiverse river, behind only the Amazon. The river’s fish are the main source of protein for millions of people. The river also nourishes some of the region’s most productive agricultural fields. Tourists flock to the Mekong River from across the world, contributing to all four countries’ economies.
Now Laos wants to build nine hydropower dams on the river and sell the electricity to neighboring countries. With the help of Thailand, Laos has already started construction on the first project, called the Xayaburi Dam. The problem is that the dams in Laos will cause significant harm to countries downstream. This puts Laos’ neighbors in a difficult situation. Scientists have concluded that if the dams are built, the food security of millions of people in all four countries will be threatened.
The costs of damming the Mekong
The stakes are high. As one of Asia’s poorest countries, Laos sees the dams as an opportunity to earn much needed revenue. For the project developers, the Xayaburi Dam provides a cash windfall. Yet leading scientific studies have found that many of the dams’ costs will be borne by other governments and people living downstream, rather than the dam developers themselves. The dams will block fish migrations, leading to drastic declines in Cambodia’s fisheries industry. They will also reduce the flow of nutrients downstream to rice paddies and agricultural fields in Vietnam’s Mekong Delta. Many of the region’s poorest villagers who live along the riverbanks will lose their farmland and the fish that provide their main source of protein.  Scientists have found no viable measures to mitigate the harm or replace lost food security.
As a water dispute arises, a treaty fails
In 1995, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam signed a treaty to promote cooperation in use of the Mekong River. The treaty created the Mekong River Commission, which is tasked with finding mutually acceptable ways to use and sustain the river. As part of this, the treaty requires the governments to seek agreement before beginning major projects on the Mekong, using a process called “prior consultation.”
The Xayaburi Dam was the first big test for the commission. Instead of seeking agreement, however, the commission hit gridlock. When the four governments first met to discuss the project in April 2011, Cambodia and Vietnam asked for dam construction to be postponed, so that transboundary impacts studies could be conducted. Laos and Thailand refused to do these studies.
With no clear resolution to the prior consultation, Laos and Thailand decided to proceed with the project anyway. The commission provided few opportunities for the fishermen and communities who would live near the dams to be heard, and many still do not know when construction vehicles will show up or when they will be told to move.
On November 7, 2012, Laos held a groundbreaking ceremony for the Xayaburi Dam (although construction actually began in late 2010). Laos claimed that the dam had been re-designed to address Cambodia’s and Vietnam’s concerns, although the Mekong River Commission had not yet seen details of the re-design. Cambodia and Vietnam remained silent after the announcement, leading to speculation that a deal had been struck.
Cambodia and Vietnam find their voice
On January 17, government ministers gathered in Laos for the annual meeting of the Mekong River Commission’s governing body. Although the Xayaburi Dam was not on the agenda, the governments finally spoke out. Discussions became tense. Cambodia said that Laos had misinterpreted the 1995 Mekong treaty by proceeding with the Xayaburi Dam before the “prior consultation” was finished. Vietnam said that the recent launching of the dam “is causing concerns…about its adverse impacts on downstream areas.” Even Thailand acknowledged that concerns still exist.
Donors to the Mekong River Commission also spoke up. In a joint statement, Australia, Japan, European countries, the United States, and others said, “It is our consensus that building dams on the mainstream of the Mekong may irrevocably change the river and hence constitute a challenge for food security, sustainable development, and biodiversity conservation.” At the end of the meeting, Laos announced “with deep regrets” that it could not sign the meeting’s official minutes, signaling that it did not acknowledge the criticisms. Days later, the Lao government’s Vientiane Times published an article claiming that the commission supported the Xayaburi Dam.
Public concern with the dams
As the commission’s meetings falter along, citizens in all four countries have searched for ways to raise their concerns to government officials. Thai villagers who live near the Mekong River have protested their country’s involvement in the project and filed a lawsuit. Journalists and civil society groups continue to monitor the situation and report on the status of the dams, because the Mekong River Commission’s own transparency has been limited. Scientists across the world continue to raise concerns.
Meanwhile, Laos has prevented any public criticism of the dam within its own borders. In December, the government expelled a Swiss activist, Anne-Sophie Gindroz. One week later, prominent Lao activist Sombath Somphone was kidnapped. Although the reason for his kidnapping is unknown, evidence suggests that the Lao government was involved. Both Mr. Somphone and Ms. Gindroz helped to organize a forum last October where the Mekong dams were publicly criticized. Mr. Somphone remains missing, and other Lao citizens who have been critical of the Mekong dams are now in hiding.
What happens next?
Is this the beginning of a Mekong water conflict? Conflict may grow as the Xayaburi Dam’s impacts are felt over the coming years, and as Laos moves forward with other Mekong dams. Within the next year, evidence suggests that Laos will give the go-ahead for construction on two other dams, including one that is only two kilometers from the Cambodian border.
On the other hand, the politics of the Mekong are complicated. The region’s economies are closely intertwined, and governments are hesitant to damage relations with one another. Cambodia has proposed to build two of its own dams on the Mekong, and Vietnam is involved in three of the proposed dams, although none of these projects are likely to move forward anytime soon. Thailand plans to buy the electricity from eight of the eleven dams, although energy experts in Thailand are saying that the electricity is not needed. China is involved in several of the dams as well and may be exerting pressure on Cambodia and Vietnam to support the dams.
As the Mekong governments become entangled in a diplomatic dispute, the outcome is uncertain, but one thing is clear. For the millions of poor villagers who depend on the Mekong River for food security, and who have no voice in their governments’ decisions, challenging times lie ahead. "

Luang Prabang, Laos ","Cambodia, Vietnam, and Donors Challenge Laos on Mekong Dams",,,Xayaburi dam ,energy plants - dams,Laos,"
Luang Prabang, Laos:  At yesterday’s 19th Mekong River Commission (MRC) Council Meeting, heated debate occurred over Laos’ construction of the Xayaburi Dam and plans to build a cascade of dams on the Lower Mekong River. According to participants at the meeting, MRC governments disagreed about the prior consultation procedures and how they had been applied in the case of the Xayaburi Dam. The Cambodian delegation asserted that Laos had misinterpreted the Mekong Agreement and that the prior consultation process had never been completed. Meanwhile, Vietnam requested that no further developments on the Mekong mainstream occur until the Mekong mainstream dams study agreed upon at least year’s Council Meeting is completed. The official opening statements from Council members reveal that Cambodia and Vietnam have not changed their opposition to the Xayaburi Dam and other mainstream dams (download the opening statements below).
In his opening statement, Vietnam’s Deputy Minister of Natural Resources and the Environment diplomatically chastised the Lao government, stating that the “launching of the first mainstream hydropower project recently in the Lower Mekong Basin is causing concerns of the Governments of the riparian countries in the region and the international community about its adverse impacts on downstream areas.  While we are still trying to do the research to understand its impacts, each riparian country should show their responsibility by assuring that any future development and management of water resources proposed in the basin should be considered with due care and full precaution based on best scientific understanding of the potential impacts.”
The Cambodian and Thai Council members both asked that the Mekong mainstream dams impact study be completed as soon as possible to ensure that future decisions about mainstream dams are informed by good science. 
Meanwhile, in a Joint Statement made by the MRC’s Development Partners, donor governments expressed the need for consensus amongst the MRC governments on Mekong dams due to their transboundary impacts and requested that the Lao government disclose the Xayaburi Dam’s project design, while taking into account the concerns of their neighbors.  The statement said, “It is our consensus that building dams on the mainstream of the Mekong may irrevocably change the river and hence constitute a challenge for food security, sustainable development, and biodiversity conservation.” 
MRC Development Partners also recommended in their statement that all ambiguities in the prior consultation process be resolved before any other mainstream project proceeds.
“We applaud Cambodia and Vietnam for upholding their responsibilities in the 1995 Mekong Agreement, and donors for recognizing the flaws in the current process.  Vietnam has acted responsibly in requesting that all decisions over the development of the Mekong are based on science,” said Ms. Pianporn Deetes, Thailand Campaign Coordinator for International Rivers. “Laos needs to begin respecting the 1995 Mekong Agreement and neighboring governments’ requests by immediately stopping construction of the Xayaburi Dam.”
Throughout the MRC prior consultation process, reservations over the Xayaburi Dam and the flawed decision-making process have been expressed by the Cambodian and Vietnamese governments. Divisions between MRC member countries have remained since the MRC’s Special Joint Committee Meeting held on April 19th, 2011, in which the government of Lao PDR proposed to proceed with the project. In contrast, the governments of Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam called for an extension to the decision-making process, citing concerns about transboundary impacts and knowledge gaps that require both further study and public consultation.  Vietnam requested a ten-year moratorium on decisions over mainstream dams.  At the 18th MRC Council Meeting in December 2011, the four governments agreed to carry out a study on the impacts of the Mekong mainstream dams.  The study has been slow to progress with the countries only recently agreeing upon the study’s concept note.
“No further projects should be allowed to undergo the MRC’s prior consultation process until an immediate review of the process is carried out by the four governments, with the participation of the region’s public,” said  Mr. Kirk Herbertson, Southeast Asia Policy Coordinator for International Rivers.  “The Mekong River Commission is in desperate need of legal and institutional reform.  It’s a broken process that needs immediate fixing.”
On Friday, January 18th, representatives of the MRC Council and the Development Partners will participate in a field visit to the Xayaburi Dam site. "

Bangkok, Thailand ",Xayaburi Dam Left Off MRC Council Agenda,,,Xayaburi dam ,energy plants - dams,Laos,"
Bangkok, Thailand: The Mekong governments have left the controversial Xayaburi Dam off of the agenda of this week’s annual Mekong River Commission (MRC) Council meeting.
“By failing to address the Xayaburi Dam at the Council Meeting, the Mekong River Commission governments are evading their responsibilities,” said Mr. Niwat Roykaew of the Chiang Khong Conservation Group.   “Silence will not make the problems caused by the development of the destructive Xayaburi Dam and any future Mekong dams go away.”
In November 2012, the Lao government held the official groundbreaking ceremony for the Xayaburi Dam despite ongoing concerns with the project. The MRC member countries have not reached a conclusion to the prior consultation process. Laos disregarded official requests by the governments of Cambodia and Vietnam for a transboundary impact assessment of the project, as well as advice given by the Mekong River Commission’s Secretariat to delay the dam’s construction until necessary studies were first carried out.  In last week’s Cambodia Daily newspaper, Cambodia’s Environment Minister reiterated the country’s position by stating “Prime Minister Hun Sen said there has to be an environmental impact study first to see how it affects  and we asked Laos to respect the suspension.”
International donors have also raised concerns. Most recently, in November the U.S. government announced that it is “concerned that construction is proceeding before impact studies have been completed.”
“For over two years, the proposed Xayaburi Dam has sharply divided the region’s governments and become one of the world’s highest profile transboundary water disputes,” said Ms. Pianporn Deetes of International Rivers.  “As Laos has consistently refused to cooperate with its neighbors, it’s no surprise that the issue is not on the agenda.  Laos has violated the Mekong Agreement, made false claims that the dam is environmentally sustainable, and ignored the general consensus amongst fishery experts that its proposed mitigation measures for fishery impacts are unlikely to work.”
A legal analysis published this week by International Rivers found that Laos has violated the 1995 Mekong Agreement and international law by proceeding with the Xayaburi Dam.
“Regional governments hold the power to prevent the tragedy of the commons that will likely occur if the Xayaburi and other Mekong mainstream dams move forward.  Yet to do so, depends upon the Mekong governments taking immediate action to demand that construction of the Xayaburi Dam and other mainstream projects halt until further studies and public consultation occur,” said Mr. Chhith Sam Ath of the The NGO Forum on Cambodia. “We are appealing to regional governments and donors to ensure that a review of the prior consultation process is conducted before any other projects move forward to prevent other projects from following the same problematic path of the Xayaburi Dam.”
Over the past four years, civil society, academics, scientists, donor governments and MRC member countries have raised concerns over the threat the Xayaburi Dam and other Mekong mainstream dams pose to food security of millions of people and the ecological integrity of the Mekong River.  
“The extent and severity of the impact that the Xayaburi Dam will have on the livelihoods and food security of the Mekong people remains unknown,” said Ms. Lam Thi Thu Suu of the Vietnam Rivers Network and Centre for Social Research and Development.  “As a shared river, our future depends on the regional governments cooperating and addressing the problems associated with the Xayaburi Dam before it’s too late.”
During a field visit to the Mekong River last week, International Rivers discovered that other dams proposed on the Mekong River’s mainstream in Laos are advancing.  At the proposed Pak Beng Dam site, which has yet to enter the MRC’s prior consultation process, villagers told International Rivers that project implementation is expected to begin in the next two to twelve months with the construction of the dam’s access roads.  Villagers also stated that Chinese companies have recently concluded feasibility studies for the Pak Lay and Sanakham dams.  Last September, International Rivers found that some work had already begun at the Don Sahong Dam site with the blasting of two rapids to make way for fish passage.
The 19th Meeting of the Mekong River Commission Council will take place on January 16-17th in Luang Prabang, Laos.  International donors to the Commission are expected to release a statement at the meeting.

The Theun-Hinboun Power Company commenced operation of its
Expansion Project in Central Laos today, jeopardizing the livelihoods of tens
of thousands of people. The project, consisting of a new dam on the Nam Ngouang
River and a doubling of capacity at the existing Theun-Hinboun powerhouse, will
double the amount of water being diverted into the Hai and Hinboun Rivers,
causing extensive flooding and other impacts. The project been marked by
controversy for years due to the company's failure to compensate villagers for
the impacts of the first project and poor plans for compensating communities
whose lives will be affected by the expansion. International Rivers has been
monitoring the Theun-Hinboun Dam since it first commenced operations in 1998.
 ""The Theun-Hinboun
Expansion Project has displaced over 7500 people and will affect the
livelihoods of tens of thousands more people living downstream,"" said Tania
Lee, Lao Program Coordinator for International Rivers. ""The plans to restore
livelihoods are woefully inadequate. The Theun-Hinboun Power Company - which is
part-owned by the Norwegian state-owned company Statkraft - is profiting at the
expense of some of Southeast Asia's poorest people.""
Since the original Theun-Hinboun Project started operations in 1998,
thousands of people living downstream along the Hai and Hinboun Rivers have
experienced flooding of rice fields, decreases in fish catch and inability to
grow vegetables along the riverbanks. Despite these heavy losses, project
owners have never adequately compensated communities. The Theun-Hinboun
Expansion Project will exacerbate the effects of the first dam and force many
people living downstream along the Hai and Hinboun Rivers to move to new
relocation sites away from the river. For many villagers, this will make living
off the land increasingly impossible.
Already several villages have been relocated to new sites
downstream and interviews with these villagers reveal that people are worried
about how they will grow rice and feed their families in the future. Land
shortages abound and many villagers have been given poor quality land that
cannot sustain rice cultivation. Thousands more people are expected to be
relocated in the coming five years due to project-induced flooding. According
to Lao laws, these villagers have the legal right to know when and where they
will be moved. However, there are no clear plans publicly available outlining
these details or providing information about how people will be able to grow
sufficient food for their families at the new sites.
""Without adequate livelihood restoration programs in place,
economic insecurity and chronic food shortages are likely to become serious
problems for affected communities,"" said Ms. Lee, who has visited affected
villages several times over the past year.
The Theun-Hinboun Power Company is jointly owned by the Government
of Laos, the Norwegian state-owned company Statkraft and GMS Power of Thailand.
The US$585.5 million Theun-Hinboun Expansion Project is financed by four Thai
commercial banks, Australia's ANZ Bank, France's BNP Paribas Bank, and public
investments from France, Germany and the Netherlands.
""Project financiers such as ANZ Bank and BNP Paribas have an
obligation to ensure that the Theun-Hinboun Power Company fully restores the
livelihoods of all affected communities. Action plans for relocating downstream
communities should be immediately released to the public and independent
monitors should be established to ensure that commitments by the project
developer are upheld,"" concluded Ms. Lee. "

UK ",Senior HSBC bankers need to face jail for their bank’s role in laundering drugs money,HSBC ,United Kingdom,,,,"
Today, Europe's
largest bank, HSBC, announced that it will pay $1.9 billion (£1.2 billion) to
settle allegations that it laundered money for drugs cartels, terrorists and
pariah states. During approximately the same period that HSBC failed to check
whether the dollars it was shipping from Mexico to the US were drugs money,
47,000 people died at the hands of Mexican drugs traffickers.
""Fines alone
are not going to change banks' behaviour: the chances of being caught are
relatively small and the potential profits from accepting dodgy clients are too
big.  Fines are seen as a cost of doing business,"" said Rosie Sharpe,
campaigner at Global Witness. 
""Instead,
regulators should hold senior bankers legally responsible for their banks'
money laundering performance.  At the very least, senior bankers should be
prevented from working in the industry, akin to the way in which doctors can be
struck off.  Bonuses should be clawed back, and, in the most serious
cases, senior bankers should face jail,"" said Sharpe.
According to
the chair of the US Senate Subcommittee, HSBC's culture was ‘pervasively
polluted'.  The number of drugs cartels in Mexico makes it a high risk for
money laundering.  HSBC Mexico had high risk clients such as money
remitters and offered high risk products such as dollar accounts in the Cayman
Islands.  Despite this, HSBC US treated its Mexican affiliate as low risk. 
The result was that HSBC's Mexican operations moved $7bn in physical cash into
the US between 2007 and 2008. Instead of prosecuting senior bankers, however,
the US Department of Justice has entered into a ‘deferred prosecution
agreement' with the bank, in which the bank is essentially granted immunity
from prosecution in exchange for doing what they should have been doing all
along.  ""If you get caught with your hand in the till you go to jail, but
if you're a big bank and you're caught breaking the law, it seems that all that
happens is you're fined and told you'll go to jail if you do it again,"" said
Sharpe. 
Yesterday the
UK's Home Affairs Select Committee said that fines against banks that aided
money laundering and drugs trafficking were not enough. The Committee
recommended personal, criminal liability for those who hold the most senior
positions in banks that are found to have been involved in money laundering.
As well as
prosecuting senior HSBC bankers, bonuses should be clawed back.  Lord
Green was appointed HSBC chief executive in 2003 and chairman in 2006, and is
now the UK Trade Minister.  ""We estimate that Lord Green pocketed more
than £25 million in bonuses and shares during his time at HSBC, despite the
fact that the bank's own criteria for awarding bonuses is meant to take into
account adherence to ethical standards; he should return this money,"" said
Sharpe.   
HSBC accepted
responsibility for its past mistakes and stated that it had comprehensively
changed its approach to anti-money laundering compliance. The bank will be
monitored by the Department of Justice for the five year term of the agreement.
Notes
to editors

HSBC issued a press release stating that it
     had reached a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the Department of
     Justice, as part of which it would pay $1.9 billion. HSBC also announced

     York County District Attorney's Office, Federal Reserve, U.S. Department
     of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, Office of the

Vientiane, Laos ",Should We Worry About Xayaburi Dam Safety?,,,Xayaburi dam ,energy plants - dams,Laos,"
The Lao government has been heavily criticized for beginning construction on the Xayaburi Dam without first studying the project’s impacts on downstream countries. The region’s most credible scientific experts have raised concerns that the dam will block fish migrations and the flow of sediments down the Mekong River, threatening food security throughout the region. No one, except for Laos’ own consultants, has said publicly that this project is going forward in a responsible way.
This week’s news of a dam collapse in Cambodia raises another important question that the Lao government has not yet answered. Is the Xayaburi Dam safe?
Safety risks of dams
Dam safety is a very real concern in the Lower Mekong region. On December 1st, a cement wall of the Stung Atay Dam in Cambodia collapsed during construction when a turbine water outlet burst. The dam’s reservoir was estimated to be around 60% full at the time and drained entirely within a few hours. Three of the dam’s construction workers were washed away and remain missing. In November, Vietnam’s Dak Mek 3 Dam collapsed when a cement truck rammed into it. In October, Vietnam cancelled 23 dams in its central highlands after an earthquake caused damage to the Song Tranh 2 Dam.
Likewise, the proposed Mekong River dams raise significant safety concerns. The Mekong River is vulnerable to extreme flooding, in part because of climate change. Earthquakes are a particular risk at the Xayaburi Dam site, which is located only 100 km from a fault line. In recent years, at least 3 earthquakes have occurred near the project site—a 7.1 magnitude earthquake in March 2011, a 4.6 magnitude earthquake in February 2011, and a 6.1 magnitude earthquake in 2007. Other safety concerns could exist as well.
Yet again, Xayaburi developers disregard MRC’s advice
While most dams do not collapse, the World Bank notes that “there are serious consequences if a dam does not function properly or fails.” As a result, the Bank developed dam safety standards in 2001 that are used widely in the hydropower industry. The Mekong River Commission (MRC) expects Mekong dam builders to follow the World Bank’s widely accepted dam safety standards. The MRC’s secretariat concluded in a March 2011 technical review that the Xayaburi project did not yet comply with these standards. The secretariat wrote, “The recent earthquake near Xayaburi emphasizes the need for an independent review of the project according to international safety standards.”
To our knowledge, the Xayaburi developers have not commissioned independent experts to review the design details of the Xayaburi project for dam safety. In its infamous August 2011 report, Laos' consultant Pöyry omitted all mention of the World Bank dam safety standards when it concluded that the project was “principally in compliance” with MRC requirements. In July 2012, Pöyry inaccurately informed a delegation of foreign government officials visiting the dam site that “the design complies with MRC design guidelines.”
Xayaburi: The Non-Transparent Dam
Regardless of whether you believe the Xayaburi Dam can be built sustainably, the Lao government’s process for pushing the project forward has been irresponsible. Laos’ approach of beginning construction now and refusing to complete proper impact studies beforehand ignores the concerns of neighboring countries as well as the recommendations of the MRC Secretariat. The project has set a precedent that has undermined the 1995 Mekong Agreement, leaving future Mekong River cooperation in jeopardy.
There is still a lot unknown about the impacts that the Xayaburi project will bring. Pöyry says it has designed a new fish passage technology, for example, but the design details remain a secret. The fish that are intended to use this technology have not been fully studied or identified. Nor has any fish passage ever been used successfully on a dam as high as this one (32 meters) or on a river with as many fish species as the Mekong. Likewise, even Laos’ consultant CNR has acknowledged that the plan to prevent the dam from trapping sediments is “conceptual” and that “these solutions need to be developed and their costs evaluated.”
We should also add dam safety to the list of concerns. We do not know if this dam is safe. We cannot rely solely on the claims of the Lao government and Pöyry, which has proved their willingness to say anything to allow this project to go forward. "

United States ","New Global Assessment Reveals Nearly 1,200 Proposed Coal-Fired Power Plants",,,,,,"
Coal-fired power plants are a major source
of greenhouse gas emissions—one that could be increasing significantly
globally, according to new analysis from the World Resources Institute.
Several months ago, WRI began compiling and
analyzing information about proposed new coal-fired plants in order to assess
potential future risks to the global climate. We released our findings today in
the Global Coal Risk Assessment working paper. Our research shows that 1,199
new coal-fired plants with a total installed capacity of 1,401,268 megawatts
(MW) are being proposed globally. If all of these projects are built, it would
add new coal power capacity that is almost four times the current capacity of
all coal-fired plants in the United States.
Coal in the Developing World
Our analysis finds that 483 power companies
have proposed new coal-fired plants across 59 countries. Most of these proposed
plants are in developing nations—mainly China and India. These two countries
account for 76 percent of the proposed new coal power capacity. New coal-fired
plants are also proposed in some developing countries where there’s currently
limited or no domestic coal production, such as Cambodia and Senegal. The
United States ranks seventh out of all countries, with 36 proposed plants with
a capacity of more than 20,000 MW.
Not all of these projects will necessarily
be approved and developed—the report only looks at proposed new plants.
However, this research shows a significant—and troubling—interest in coal
development globally.
A Crucial Decade for Energy Choices
Energy is a universal need, and new energy
development is critical in the developing world in order to lift people out of
poverty and empower them to enjoy a higher quality of life. However, the choice
of energy sources is a tough one, as developing countries must seek low-cost
options. Coal-fired plants are often considered such an option, even though
strong evidence of coal’s toll on the climate, environment, and human health
suggests otherwise.
Take China: The country created an economic
miracle by relying on coal as its primary energy source. However, China has
been paying a huge price for its coal dependence in the form of increasing
public health concerns, deteriorating ecosystems, poor air quality, more carbon
pollution, and growing social tensions. While the Chinese government announced
a target to cap coal consumption at 3.9 billion tons by 2015 and introduced
ambitious energy efficiency and renewable energy policies, the country still
has a long way to go to wean itself off coal.
Last week, the International Energy Agency
(IEA) released its annual World Energy Outlook, finding that coal demand could
rise by 21 percent by 2035. The IEA points out that the future of coal depends
largely on policy decisions as well as the price of other energy sources,
including natural gas.
Fortunately, cleaner energy technologies
are becoming increasingly competitive and easily accessible. Many developing
countries have come to understand the importance of cleaner energy sources for
the long-term sustainability of their development and have put policies in
place to encourage energy efficiency and renewable energy. For example, a
significant portion of India’s new installed power generation capacity will
come from renewable energy sources in order to meet its national target of 15
percent renewable energy by 2020.
The next decade will be crucial for countries—especially
developing nations—to make the right energy choices. We hope this working paper
can inspire discussions around what should be done to avoid planetary risks
while ensuring economic growth.

Vientiane, Laos ","Days After Xayaburi Gets Green Light, Pöyry Flaunts Project's Corruption",,,Xayaburi dam ,energy plants - dams,Laos,"
On November 9, only four days after Laos announced the official start of construction on the Xayaburi Dam, Finnish company Pöyry announced that it has taken on a central role in the project. According to the company’s press release, “Pöyry will support the Government of Lao and the project owner Xayaburi Power Company Limited during the 8-year implementation period by reviewing the design and supervising the construction of the project.
In doing so, Pöyry publicly shows for the first time how it has benefited financially from its controversial 2011 study that downplayed the project's environmental and social impacts.
Regardless of whether you believe that this dam can be built in a sustainable way, it is clear that the diplomatic negotiations have been ugly. Call it what you prefer – corruption, unethical behavior, or intentional disregard for the rules of good faith cooperation between nations. Either case warrants an intervention from the governments that have stood on the sidelines throughout this conflict.
Pöyry's Central Role in Pushing the Dam Forward
Pöyry, if you recall, conducted the study that Laos has used to argue that the Xayaburi Dam will not have transboundary impacts. In May 2011, Laos hired Pöyry to evaluate the project's compliance with the requirements of the Mekong River Commission (MRC), shortly after Cambodia and Vietnam first raised concerns about the project's downstream impacts and requested that a transboundary environmental impact assessment be carried out. The MRC is the diplomatic body that is supposed to promote joint cooperation in use of the shared Mekong River. 
Pöyry determined that the project was “principally in compliance” with the MRC’s standards for dam-building, despite identifying over 40 additional studies that are still needed to understand the project’s impacts. In cases where the project was unlikely to meet the MRC’s requirements (e.g. for fish passages or dam safety), Pöyry simply omitted any mention of those requirements. Pöyry also recommended that construction continue while these studies were carried out. Scientists widely criticized the study, given the significant risk that many of the project’s impacts cannot be mitigated by the unproven technologies that Pöyry proposes to use. 
In June 2011, Pöyry also provided legal advice to Laos that the project could proceed despite opposition from neighboring countries. Laos explicitly cited Pöyry when informing developer Ch. Karnchang and the Thai government that the MRC “prior consultation” was completed. In contrast, the official MRC position at the time was that the Mekong governments had “agreed that a decision on the prior consultation process…be tabled for consideration at the ministerial level, as they could not come to a common conclusion on how to proceed with the project.” Afterwards, without informing neighboring countries, the Lao government allowed construction on the project to continue. Pöyry remained involved in the project.
From the beginning, Pöyry 's credibility was in question because of its close business ties to Ch. Karnchang, the company it was asked to evaluate. Pöyry also had a strong financial incentive to skew its 2011 study in order to provide the Lao government with a positive review – doing so brought the company several years' worth of additional revenue.
After Cambodia and Vietnam criticized Pöyry‘s work in late 2011, the Lao government hired Compagnie Nationale du Rhône (CNR) to provide a peer review of Pöyry’s work related to sediments. CNR suggested several changes to Pöyry’s sediments model and did not review Pöyry’s fisheries model. In August 2012, CNR issued a press statement clarifying that it had only presented a “conceptual” model of the dam and that further studies were still needed, in contrast to Pöyry’s view that construction should continue. 
Laos Relies on Pöyry to Lobby Neighboring Countries
After International Rivers discovered in June 2012 that construction activities were well underway, the Lao government invited a delegation of foreign governments to visit the dam site in July. (At the time, the Lao government referred to all activities as “preliminary work” and repeatedly promised that construction would not start until neighboring countries’ concerns were addressed.) Pöyry led the July 2012 visit, making presentations that portrayed the project as environmentally responsible. The Lao government – in cooperation with the state-run Vientiane Times – lobbied hard to present the Pöyry and CNR studies as proof that neighboring countries' concerns with the transboundary impacts had been addressed.
Meanwhile, Laos refused to conduct studies on the Xayaburi Dam’s transboundary impacts. At most, only a few months' worth of baseline data were collected to ground-truth Pöyry’s promises. The project’s original environmental impact assessment only examined what would happen 10 kilometers downstream from the site, which severely limited the amount of data on which Pöyry based its models.
Is Silence the Same as Approval?
By November 2012, the Lao government appears to have successfully convinced the Cambodian and Vietnamese governments to buy into the Pöyry and CNR studies. Both countries continued to call for further studies on the Xayaburi Dam’s impacts, but no longer called for these studies to take place before construction began as scientists had recommended. Both governments may have felt that Laos' continued construction made the project inevitable by this point, and that a strong intervention jeopardized the countries’ close economic ties. Indeed, by this point almost all discussions have been taking place outside the MRC framework and there was little leverage left provided by the 1995 Mekong Agreement between the countries.
For the past several years, donor governments such as Australia, Finland, Germany, and the United States have financially kept the MRC afloat. The commission is supposed to serve as the key framework for promoting cooperation around use of the Mekong River, the region’s largest shared natural resource. On Pöyry’s advice (and to its financial benefit), the Xayaburi process has moved far outside the MRC. No government has criticized Laos’ recent decision to proceed with the project, except for the United States. Nor has any government criticized the way that Laos and Pöyry have undermined the MRC. People throughout the region are outraged. The tolerance for corruption around the Mekong dams, it seems, is quite high.
The Xayaburi Dam has become a stark example of why governments need to strengthen oversight of the overseas activities of their companies. Finland in particular should not allow its companies to exploit the authoritarian nature of governments such as the one in Laos. This is not the same as saying that Laos and Pöyry cannot build dams – rather, it is saying that they must play by the rules to do so.

Vientiane, Laos ",Laos Evades Responsibility and Plows Ahead with Xayaburi Dam,,,Xayaburi dam ,energy plants - dams,Laos,"

In clear defiance of its neighbors and
a regional agreement, the Lao government has announced that it will hold a groundbreaking
ceremony at the Xayaburi Dam site on the Mekong River this Wednesday, November
7th. Mr. Viraphonh Viravong, Laos' Deputy Minister of Energy and Mining, told a
group of journalists yesterday, ""It has been assessed, it has been discussed
the last two years. We have addressed most of the concerns.""  After the
ceremony, the project developers are expected to begin construction on the coffer dam, which diverts the river while the
permanent dam wall is built. The coffer dam is expected to be completed by May
2013.
""The international community should not
let the Lao government get away with such a blatant violation of international
law,"" said Ms. Ame Trandem, Southeast Asia Program Director for International
Rivers. ""We are calling on donor governments and the governments of Thailand,
Vietnam and Cambodia to take a firm stand against Laos. The Xayaburi Dam is the
first of a cascade of devastating mainstream dams that will severely undermine
the region's development efforts. The food security and jobs of millions of
people in the region are now on the line.""
Construction activities at the dam site
began in late 2010. In April 2011, the Cambodian and Vietnamese governments
asked the Lao government for further studies on the project's transboundary
impacts. In December 2011, the four governments of the Mekong River Commission
met and agreed to conduct further studies on the impacts of the Xayaburi Dam
and 10 other proposed mainstream dams. To date, no regional agreement has been
made to build the Xayaburi Dam despite the 1995 Mekong Agreement's requirement
that the governments of Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand and Laos cooperate and seek
joint agreement on mainstream projects.
""Laos said it would cooperate with
neighboring countries, but this was never genuine,"" continued Trandem.
""Instead, the project always continued on schedule and was never actually
delayed.  None of Vietnam and Cambodia's environmental and social concerns
have been taken seriously.  Laos has never even collected basic
information about the ways that people depend on the river, so how can it say
that there will be no impacts?""
On October 22nd, Vietnam's Minister of
Natural Resources and Environment met the Lao Prime Minister and requested that
all construction on the Xayaburi Dam be stopped until necessary studies to
assess the impacts of Mekong mainstream dams were first carried out. Laos
continues to deny that the dam will have transboundary impacts and is applying
the recommended mitigation measures made by Finnish consulting company Pöyry and French company Compagnie Nationale du
Rhône, despite
the fact that the project has never carried out a transboundary impact
assessment. The Cambodian government, Vietnamese government, and scientists
throughout the Mekong region have disagreed with the work of these companies.
""Laos is playing roulette with the Mekong
River, offering unproven solutions and opening up the Mekong as a testing
ground for new technologies.  When the Mekong River Commission stays quiet
and tolerates one country risking the sustainability of the Mekong River and all
future transboundary cooperation, something is seriously wrong,"" said Ms
Pianporn Deetes, Thailand Campaign Coordinator for International Rivers. ""As
Thai companies serve as the project's developers, financers and the Thai
government will purchase the bulk of the Xayaburi Dam's electricity, Thailand
has the responsibility to call for a stop to construction immediately and
cancel its power purchase agreement until there is regional agreement to build
the dam.  This move by Laos sets a dangerous precedent for the future of
the Mekong region. If Laos is allowed to proceed unhindered, then in the future
all member governments will proceed unilaterally on projects on the Mekong
River. The Mekong Agreement will become yet another useless piece of paper.""
""Unless the Mekong crisis is tackled
immediately, the future of the region is in great danger,"" concluded Deetes.
""With the Asian and European heads of states gathered in Laos for the ASEM
Summit, it's time that the international community takes a strong stand and
makes it clear that such actions by Laos will not be tolerated.""

Nong Khai, Thailand ",Thai Communities Protest Xayaburi Dam at the Asia-Europe Summit,,,Xayaburi dam ,energy plants - dams,Laos,"
As world leaders gathered in Vientiane, Lao PDR for the 9th Asia-Europe Summit, 250 Thai villagers gathered in boats on the Mekong River outside the city to protest the Xayaburi Dam. The villagers represented the 24,000 people in Thailand who will be affected by the proposed Xayaburi Hydropower Project in Laos.
The Xayaburi Dam in Lao PDR—the first planned hydropower dam on the Lower Mekong Mainstream – provides warning to the Heads of State from Asia and Europe that tensions are brewing over the region’s most important shared resource. The Mekong River has reached a crisis point with plans to construct the Xayaburi Dam and a cascade of eleven dams rapidly moving forward.The protest was organized by the Network of Thai People in Eight Mekong Provinces and the Network of Community Organization Council in Seven Northeastern Provinces.
Construction on the Xayaburi Dam is currently underway, despite significant concerns raised by the Cambodian and Vietnamese governments and the people of the Mekong River Basin regarding the project’s transboundary impacts and the need for further study.
In their petition to the governments, the communities stated, ""Since energy is part of the agenda during this important meeting, we would like to inform you that the Mekong is the bloodline, the life, the spirit and the culture of at least over sixty million people."" 
Scientists have concluded that, if built, the dams will impact the food security and livelihoods of 60 million people living near the Lower Mekong River.

United Kingdom ",HSBC rakes in US$130 million bankrolling rainforest destruction and human rights abuses in Malaysia’s corrupt forestry sector,HSBC ,United Kingdom,,,,"
HSBC has bankrolled logging companies causing widespread environmental destruction and human rights abuses in Sarawak, Malaysia, violating its sustainability policies and earning around US$130 million in the process, a Global Witness investigation reveals today. The bank is also providing financial services to companies widely suspected of systematic bribery and corruption.
Malaysia’s Sarawak region exports more tropical timber than South America and Africa combined and now has just five per cent of its forests left intact following decades of industrial-scale logging and plantation development. The Global Witness report, “In the Future There Will Be No Forests Left”, identifies loans and services to seven of the region’s largest logging conglomerates that would have generated HSBC an estimated US$130 million in interest and fees.
The companies supported by HSBC have devastated Malaysian Borneo’s rainforests and carried out various abuses against indigenous communities. Sarawak’s logging giants, all past or present HSBC clients, have since expanded their destructive model of business to every major tropical forested region in the world. These companies are currently logging or converting forests to plantations in 18 million hectares of concessions – an area three times the size of Norway.
“HSBC has bankrolled some of the world’s worst logging companies and in some cases got them off the ground with their first commercial loans. The destruction they have caused simply couldn’t have happened without the services and kudos the bank provided,” said Tom Picken, Global Witness Forest Campaign leader.
By providing services to a sector notorious for corruption and high-level political links, HSBC is at serious risk of violating international anti-money laundering regulations which require it to carry out extra checks on clients linked to senior politicians.
Sarawak is headed by Chief Minister Taib, currently the subject of a probe by Malaysia’s Federal Anti-Corruption unit. Taib holds complete political control over the region’s land allocation and forestry licensing, and is widely believed to use this power for the benefit of his family and associates. Several of HSBC’s Sarawak clients are closely connected to Taib’s family. Global Witness has obtained strong evidence showing Taib and members of his family are engaged in systemic corruption and money laundering.
Global Witness Forest Campaign Leader Tom Picken said, “In light of recent money-laundering scandals, HSBC and its financial regulators urgently need to find out whether the bank is handling illegal transactions from this notoriously corrupt and destructive sector”.
The report shows how four of HSBC’s current clients in Sarawak systematically violated the bank’s 2004 forestry policies. These required the bank to drop clients that did not have a credible likelihood of having 70 per cent of their operations certified to the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) or equivalent standard by 2009. None of HSBC’s Sarawak forestry clients investigated by Global Witness hold a single FSC certificate. This represents a 100 per cent compliance failure. Furthermore, Global Witness uncovered multiple instances of unsustainable and illegal operations by the companies, including the following:

Shin Yang group is logging and clearing pristine rainforest in an area proposed by the Malaysian authorities for national park status. The company is illegally logging on steep slopes and along river banks. Local communities and former staff of Shin Yang have independently alleged the company hires armed gangsters to intimidate and assault those who voice concerns or act against the company’s interests.
Sarawak Oil Palms is clearing and draining globally-significant high conservation value peat forests for oil palm plantations, releasing vast quantities of greenhouse gas emissions. The company also cleared part of a proposed national park that was listed by the Malaysian government as a conservation area for threatened trees. The company is in conflict with local communities which claim native customary rights over areas where it operates.
WTK group has been logging destructively – and most likely illegally – in pristine mountain rainforest in the “Heart of Borneo”. These operations triggered a series of catastrophic landslides that blocked Sarawak’s largest river for a 50km stretch in 2010.
Ta Ann group is clear-cutting rainforest confirmed as habitat for the critically endangered orangutan in the “Heart of Borneo”. The company advertises that it holds a “HSBC Forest Policy” certificate.


Picken said “In 2004 HSBC brought in progressive world-wide forest policies designed to avoid precisely these sorts of commercial relationships and make the bank a market leader on sustainability. It has consistently traded on these commitments in public, yet failed to meet them in practice. The bank should hold its hands up, drop these clients immediately and compensate the victims for the mayhem it has helped cause.”

San Fransisco ",Bankrolling Climate Disruption,,,,,,"
Rising concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have 
begun to disrupt the global climate, triggering extreme weather events around 
the globe in recent years. To address this growing climate crisis, the 
global economy must rapidly transition to low-carbon energy sources. This 
transition poses major challenges for the banking sector, which will need to 
shift its financing from fossil fuel-based power sources to low-carbon energy 
infrastructure.
To date, the banking sector has accelerated climate change through its 
""financed emissions,"" the greenhouse gas emissions induced by bank loans, 
investments, and financial services. The Rainforest Action Network report, 
""Bankrolling Climate Disruption: the Impacts of the Banking Sector's Financed 
Emissions"", analyzes the climate impacts of these emissions and the risks they 
pose for banks.
The growing climate, reputational, and financial risks from the emissions 
footprints of bank financing portfolios make it imperative for banks to measure 
and reduce their financed emissions:

Time is running out for banks to finance the transition to a low-carbon 
economy - By the end of the decade, locked-in emissions from new infrastructure 
will make it impossible to limit global greenhouse gas concentrations to safe 
levels, making it imperative for banks to begin to reduce the carbon footprints 
of their financing portfolios.

The risks involved with financing carbon-intensive companies are growing - 
The financed emissions footprints of banks leave them vulnerable to reputational 
risks from a climate-aware public and to financial risks from financing 
relationships with companies that will struggle to compete in a 
carbon-constrained economy.

Banks have made environmental financing commitments, but have failed to 
measure their climate impacts - Major U.S. banks have committed over $100 
billion to green financing initiatives, but have failed to measure whether these 
commitments have significantly reduced their portfolio-wide climate 
impacts.

The report concludes by recommending actions banks can take to join their 
public sector counterparts in setting financed emissions reduction 
targets.

Nijmegen, Netherlands ",BankTrack comments on draft Equator Principles III,,,,,,"

BankTrack, the international NGO network monitoring investment decisions and sustainability commitments of large international banks, today submitted its comments on the Equator Principles III draft text (EPIII) . The submission followed a meeting in London on September 25 where BankTrack shared its view on EPIII with the Equator Principles Association (Association) 
Following earlier BankTrack reports , this new submission assesses the draft EPIII text on whether it adequately deals with five major issues left unresolved in EPII:

Increase the transparency of the workings of the Principles and the Association
Increase the accountability of the Principles and adopting banks towards stakeholders and affected communities
Extend the scope of the Principles
Adequately deal with climate change
Adequately deal with human rights obligations of banks

Overall, BankTrack considers EPIII an improvement over EPII, notably in the extension of the scope of the Principles and the commitment of EPFIs to post more project level information on their website.
Yet, the detailed assessment leads BankTrack to conclude that bigger steps must be taken by the Association if the new Equator Principles are to become a leading initiative on sustainable finance. The Association seems prepared to only take tiny, over cautious steps ahead where bold moves are required, thus risking to be overrun by the very developments and risks the Equator Principles are supposed to manage.
The absence of any meaningful commitment on tackling climate change is a case in point. The EPFIs are to a substantial extent deepening the climate crisis by continuing to invest in ever more oil, gas, coal extraction, and coal power projects. This will not be mitigated by merely requiring borrowers to ‘assess less GHG intensive alternatives and consider them when financially feasible' and ‘report on GHG emission levels'. BankTrack expects the new Equator Principles to include mandatory requirements on borrrowers that will lead to a substantial reduction of the overall climate impact of all projects financed under Equator.
Yann Louvel, BankTrack's climate and energy campaign coordinator, comments: ""It is astonishing and disappointing that the Equator Principles banks, while claiming to adhere to the gold standard for managing environmental and social risk by banks, continue to turn a blind eye to the severe risk they pose on the planet and on themselves by financing projects that exacerbate and accelerate climate change such as tar sands, coal fired power plants or Arctic drilling.""
Johan Frijns, BankTrack Director, comments: ""it took seven years since EPII, and fifteen months of talking by the Equator banks to produce this draft, yet there is a real risk that EPIII will not be the commitment we need from banks to take up their responsibilities towards stakeholders, impacted communities and the planet. We simply expect more of EPIII.""

Tianjin, China ",Raising public awareness and build NGOs' capacity in China,,,,,,"
The forum was 
held at the International Conference Hall of Tian Yu Hotel in Tianjin, 
China. Over 70 participants attended the forum, 
including representatives from local and International NGOs, green 
businesses, prestigious universities, Ministry of Environmental 
Protection, China Industrial Bank and several media.
In the 
morning session, four speeches were given by the guest speakers. First, a
 representative from Chinese Academy for Environmental Planning gave a 
key-note speech on Green Economy in China: From Concept to Action. 
Following it, three guest speakers from China Industrial Bank, Chinese 
Ecological Civilization Research and Promotion Association (CECRPA), and
 Greenovation Hub delivered three thematic speeches respectively on 
Sustainability Practices of China Industrial Bank, How Real Economy Puts
 Green Economy into Practice, and Chinese NGOs' Role in Promoting Green 
Economy. At the end of this session, Green Watershed and 10 other local 
NGOs jointly released the ranking on 2008-2011 Green Credit Performance 
of 16 listed Chinese banks. The ranking includes an overall ranking and 
10 classification rankings according to 10 indicators.
In the 
afternoon session, there were three panel discussions covering three 
areas in Green Economy: Green Agriculture, Green Manufacturing, and 
Green Finance. Panel Discussion I was chaired by Prof. Xiulin Gu from 
Yunnan University of Finance and Economics, with panelists from Oxfam, 
China Dialogue, and BIOFarm. The panelists discussed about Issues 
related to sustainable agriculture, such as genetically modified food, 
fair trade of agricultural products and food safety. Panel Discussion II
 was chaired by Mr. Jun Ma from Institute of Public & Environmental 
Affairs (IPE), with panelists from three manufacturing companies 
dedicated to green production. Issues on clean production, green supply 
chain and efficient business management were discussed on. In the third 
panel discussion, Mr. Xiaogang Yu from Green Watershed facilitated the 
discussion with three representatives from China Industrial Bank, Jinan 
University and Peking University. The discussion focused on the 
implementation of Green Credit Guidelines issued by CBRC, Green Finance 
transformation in China, and the Equator Principle III Draft. To set up 
the NGO network of Green Credit advocacy, Green Watershed issued the 
Advocacy of Green Credit signed by 25 Chinese environmental NGOs at the 
end of the session.
Green Finance Advocacy Workshop for Chinese NGOs
On
 September 11th and 12th, the Green Finance Advocacy Workshop for 
Chinese NGOs was held in Tian Yu Hotel of Tianjin. The workshop had over
 50 participants from 37 NGOs from China and abroad, including Friends 
of Nature, Global Environmental Institute, International Rivers, 
Transition Suginami (Tokyo). The trainers were Mr. Johan Frijns from 
BankTrack (Netherlands), Dr. Andreas Missbach from Berne Declaration 
(Switzerland) and Ms. Michelle Chan from Friends of the Earth (US). Mr. 
Xiaogang Yu from Green Watershed and Mr. Jun Ma from IPE also gave 
several presentations at the workshop.
The workshop was generally
 designed to include two parts, and each part was broken down into a 
couple of sessions that were connected to each other. The first part, 
which was held on September 11th, focused on the basics of green 
finance, sustainable banking, current international initiatives and 
domestic policies, and the role of NGOs to hold banks accountable. In 
addition, NGO participants joined a group discussion to identify various
 stakeholders of green credit and their attitudes towards and influence 
on the development of green credit.
The second part, which was 
held on September 12th, focused on strategies for campaigning and 
general action plans for future cooperation. The trainers and presenters
 from BankTrack, Berne Declaration, BankWiser, Friends of the Earth, 
Green Watershed and International Rivers delivered presentations and 
shared their experiences in some of the campaigns their organizations 
initiated or involved in. Also, all participants joined a group 
discussion on What to Expect in the Future: Joint Action Plan. They were
 encouraged to think about how to impact changes on four sectors 
respectively: the policymaking and regulatory sector, the banking 
sector, the business sector, and the public and media sector. They have 
successfully integrated the knowledge they learned from the workshop 
into the joint action plan.
Public Lecture at Nankai University
After
 the forum, a public lecture was delivered at Nankai University in the 
evening of September 10th, 2012. The theme of the lecture was Green 
Economy and Future Leaders. Two speakers were Mr. Xiaogang Yu from Green
 Watershed and Mr. Jun Ma from IPE. The majority of the audience were 
about 20 college students from Tianjin who have a strong interest in 
green finance and green economy, and NGO's roles in the green 
transformation. The lecture helped to publicize the knowledge of green 
finance and promote public participation.
Participation in Summer Davos 2012
Mr.
 Xiaogang Yu attended the Sumer Davos 2012 in Tianjin as a 
representative from Green Watershed, with two other NGO representatives 
from IPE and Greenovation Hub. This was a great chance to talk with and 
advocate for green finance to world-class business CEOs and political 
elites. "

Brasilia, Brazil ",Supreme Court Judge Overturns Suspension of Belo Monte Dam,,,Belo Monte dam ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"
The Brazilian Supreme Court has overturned the suspension of the Belo
 Monte Dam, caving to pressure from President Dilma Rousseff's 
administration without giving appropriate consideration to indigenous 
rights implications of the case, human rights groups said today. The 
case illustrates the Brazilian judiciary's alarming lack of 
independence, when powerful interests are at stake.
On
 August 27th the Chief Justice of the Brazilian Supreme Court Carlos 
Ayres Britto unilaterally overturned an August 14th ruling by a regional
 federal court (TRF-1) to suspend construction of the controversial Belo
 Monte Dam. The suspension was based on illegalities in the 2005 
congressional authorization of the project due to the absence of prior 
consultations with affected indigenous peoples, as required by the 
federal constitution and ILO Convention 169. 
""This unfortunate 
decision doesn't invalidate the TRF1's judgment that the project is 
unconstitutional,"" said Atossa Soltani, Executive Director of Amazon 
Watch. ""This is a failure of the judiciary to stand up to entrenched 
interests and the power of a politically motivated executive branch that
 wants the Belo Monte Dam to move forward at all costs.""
The 
Federal Public Prosecutor's Office  is expected to appeal Britto's 
decision and demand a review by the full Supreme Court.  Yesterday's 
decision was not a judgment of the merits of the case and the Supreme 
Court may still uphold the historic decision that suspended this highly 
controversial Amazon dam project two weeks ago.  ""This suspension was 
based on an instrument dating back to the time of the dictatorship and 
is still used in Brazil. We've had favorable decisions on many of our 
legal actions, but they can end up suspended by such measures"" said 
Felicio Pontes Jr., a federal public prosecutor in the state of Pará and
 one of the authors of the lawsuit filed in 2006 that questions 
Congressional authorization of Belo Monte in the absence of prior 
consultations with indigenous peoples.
Justice Britto was reported
 to have received multiple Ministers and other government 
representatives in recent days who argued against the suspension of Belo
 Monte and long overdue consultations with indigenous peoples. Despite 
repeated requests, he was unwilling to meet with representatives of 
indigenous communities affected by the project, prior to issuing his 
decision on Monday.
This case is emblematic of a seriously flawed
 legal system, where bureaucracy and political interventions allow for 
systematic violations of human rights and environmental law,"" said Brent
 Millikan, Amazon Program Director at International Rivers. ""There is an
 urgent need to judge the merits of over a dozen lawsuits against Belo 
Monte that are still awaiting their day in court.""
Justice 
Britto's decision was made in response to a complaint filed by the 
Attorney General's office (AGU), in which the central argument was that 
the regional court's decision conflicted with a previous Supreme Court 
ruling in 2007. However, the prior Supreme Court decision actually 
recognized that the Brazilian Congress' authorization of Belo Monte - in
 the absence of prior consultations with indigenous peoples - was 
flawed. Instead of canceling Belo Monte altogether, the previous ruling 
ordered that an environmental impact study and consultations with 
indigenous peoples be completed in order for the Congress to reach a 
decision on whether the project should move forward.
One of the 
arguments in the AGU complaint is that the suspension of Belo Monte 
would cause social and economic chaos if some 14,000 workers were 
dismissed. There is no mention of the social, economic, and 
environmental havoc that the construction of Belo Monte is wreaking on 
the region, nor the fact that when dam construction is completed in a 
few years, some 40,000 workers are scheduled to be fired. "

San Fransisco ",Belo Monte dam suspended by High Brazilian Court,,,Belo Monte dam ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"
Federal Judge Souza Prudente of the Federal Tribunal of Brazil's
Amazon region suspended all work today on the Belo Monte Dam, invalidating
the project's environmental and installation licenses. While the project has been suspended previously on numerous
occasions, and those suspensions overturned on
political grounds, this latest decision could have some legs. The
decision breaks down in the following way:

 The
federal judge ruled that no consultations were held with indigenous people
prior to Congress issuing Decree 788 in 2005, which effectively approved the
Belo Monte Dam. Article 231 of the Brazilian
Constitution requires consultations to be held directly by the Congress prior
to approval. In this case, approval was given three years before
publication of the environmental impact assessment, and no consultations with
indigenous peoples were ever carried out by the Brazilian Congress.
 As a
result, the project's environmental license (granted in 2010) and installation
license (granted in 2011) are now considered invalid, meaning that no
further work can continue on the dam.
 Brazil's
National Congress must hold a series of public hearings, or consultations, with
the indigenous tribes that will be affected by Belo Monte. Only after such
consultations occur and are considered satisfactory, must the Congress
legislate a new approval for the dam.
 The
government and project consortium Norte Energia, S.A. can appeal to Brazil's
Supreme Court, Brazil's Superior Court of Justice, the President of the Federal
Tribunal, and Brazil's Attorney General, in the next 30 days. Since this is a
constitutional matter, the appeal is likely to go to the Supreme Court.

In a press conference given today late in
Brasil, Souza Prudente stated that ""only in a dictatorial regime does a
government approve a project before holding consultations.""
The decision supports the arguments that the
affected tribes have been making over the lifetime of Belo Monte: tribes will
face downstream
livelihood impacts as a result of a reduction in the flow of
the Xingu River on
the 100-km stretch known as the Volta Grande or ""Big Bend,"" and were
never properly consulted, much less gave their consent.
In the words of the decision itself,
""installation will cause direct
interference in the minimal ecological existence of the indigenous communities,
with negative and irreversible impacts on their health, quality of life, and
cultural patrimony, on the lands that they have traditionally occupied for time
immemorial.  This requires the authorization of the National Congress after holding
prior consultations with these communities, as deemed by law, under the penalty
of suspension of the authorization, which has been granted illegally.""
Beyond the fact that the Belo Monte Dam is now
considered illegal by one of Brazil's higher courts, the fact is that Brazil
doesn't need Belo Monte.  Economic rationale for the dam is based on a
projected economic growth of 5% or more a year, but over the past few quarters,
GDP has been lucky to grow at even a measily rate.  As far as Belo Monte's
importance to Brazil's economic race, this is really a case of the horse
following the wagon.
And, as illustrated by this historic court
decision, the wagon has been trampling on indigenous people and their rights,
along the way.
Update (August 14, 5pm PST): Looks like the government has wasted no time
responding to Judge Prudente.  The President of the Federal Regional
Tribunal is claiming that a separate decision from Prudente that also suspended
the Teles Pires Dam today, is not valid. No news yet about the
response to the decision on Belo Monte.  A true crisis in the judiciary is
brewing in Brazil! "

Bangkok, Thailand ",Thai Villagers File Lawsuit on Xayaburi Dam,,,Xayaburi dam ,energy plants - dams,Laos,"

On
August 7, a coalition of 37 Thai villagers filed a lawsuit in Thailand's
Administrative Court in Bangkok aimed at stopping the Xayaburi Dam, which is
currently under construction illegally in Laos. Even though the Xayaburi Dam is
not located in Thailand, Thai actors have played a critical role as developers,
financiers, and most importantly, buyer of the electricity. If the dam is
built, it will cause harm to Thai people living along the Mekong River in the
northeast provinces. The suit is against five Thai government bodies -
including the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), the body
that has agreed to buy 95% of the hydropower from Xayaburi - and claims that
the Thai government should have considered the project's impacts to Thai
villagers' livelihoods before agreeing to purchase power from the dam.
The
filing was accompanied by almost a hundred Thai villagers and fisherfolk from
eight Mekong provinces carrying banners, mock fish and fishing gear. The
villagers wanted people to understand why they are asking for justice, and how
they depend on the river for their food and livelihoods. The Court's staff
welcomed the villagers, allowing them to conduct a spiritual ceremony for the
mighty Mekong River and demonstrate their traditional Mekong fishing methods to
the journalists who were present. Here are some photos from the event:
It was not an easy decision for villagers to use legal action to fight
against EGAT, a giant state-owned enterprise that has so far disregarded the
villagers' concerns about the ways the dam would cause them harm. They made the
final decision to go to court because construction on the dam has continued
even though there is no approval from other riparian countries who would be
affected, including Vietnam and Cambodia.
As
Thai citizens, the villagers hope their concerns about the Xayaburi Dam's
transboundary impacts will be recognized, and their rights will be ensured. "

Sakhalin Island, Russia ",Complaint seeks resettlement and compensation from Shell and UK banks for damage caused by Sakhalin II oil and gas project,Barclays ,United Kingdom,Sakhalin II oil and gas project ,oil and gas,Russian Federation,"
Today, residents living adjacent to a highly polluting liquefied natural gas (""LNG"") plant and oil and gas export terminals on Sakhalin Island, Russia, filed a complaint against Royal Dutch Shell and three of the largest UK banks: Royal Bank of Scotland (""RBS""), Standard Chartered, and Barclays, for their failure to adhere to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's (""OECD"") Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (the ""Guidelines"").
The enormous LNG plant and the export terminals, called the Prigorodnoye Production Complex, are part of Sakhalin II, one of the world's largest integrated oil and gas projects, operated by the Russian Sakhalin Energy Investment Company (""SEIC""). According to Dmitry Lisitsyn, Chairman of Council of Sakhalin Environment Watch, a Sakhalin Island-based regional environmental organization representing the project-affected residents, ""the construction and operation of the Prigorodnoye Production Complex has severely harmed the adjacent community, endangering their health, jeopardizing their food security, and polluting and destroying local environmental resources. Community members living only 1.2 kilometers away have not been resettled or justly compensated, in violation of Russian law and international standards including the OECD Guidelines.""
The OECD developed the Guidelines to set standards for responsible business conduct in areas such as human rights and the environment. The complaint was filed with the Dutch and UK National Contact Points (""NCPs""), government offices charged with promoting observance of the Guidelines and receiving complaints about Guidelines violations. ""Shell, RBS, Standard Chartered, and Barclays share responsibility for the environmental and community damage caused by the Prigorodnoye Production Complex,"" explains Doug Norlen, Policy Director at Pacific Environment, a U.S.-based organization that works closely with Sakhalin Environmental Watch.
""Shell and these banks are only the tip of the iceberg in terms of the multinational corporations involved in the Sakhalin II Project, but they are among the most influential."" Shell, headquartered in the Netherlands and incorporated in the UK, is a major shareholder in the Project, and RBS, Standard Chartered, and Barclays are among the largest banks in the UK. ""The Dutch and UK NCPs are critical to ensuring that Shell and these UK banks comply with established international environmental and human rights standards,"" says Norlen.
""Communities demand the UK and Dutch NCPs' involvement after years of unsuccessful engagement with SEIC and its financial supporters,"" explains Sarah Singh, an attorney at US-based Accountability Counsel, which assisted in filing the complaint. ""Shell, RBS, Standard Chartered, and Barclays have thus far failed to use their influence over the Project operator to correct the environmental and human rights abuses associated with this Project.""

Altamira, Brazil ","Amidst Broken Promises, Indigenous Authorities Detain Belo Monte Dam Engineers",,,Belo Monte dam ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"

Three engineers employed by Norte Energia, S.A.
(NESA), the company building the Belo Monte Dam on Brazil's Xingu River, were detained Tuesday by Juruna and Arara tribal
authorities in the remote village of Muratu after the company failed to live up
to promised mitigation measures aimed at reducing the dam's devastating impacts
on local communities. 
The incident occurred yesterday as Norte Energia
sought to reach agreement with tribal leaders over measures to allegedly
mitigate adverse impacts stemming from construction of earthen coffer dams on
the Xingu River. The authorities report that the engineers are being prohibited
from leaving the village but there is no use of force or violence. The dams are
blocking navigation of small boats used by indigenous peoples and other local
communities, especially to reach the town of Altamira - an important center for
accessing markets, basic health care, education and other services.
In Tuesday's meeting, Norte Energia representatives
presented a proposal for a system for transportation of indigenous vessels
around the site where coffer dams are blocking boat traffic. Tribal leaders
interrupted the meeting, arguing that the proposal was ludicrous, and that such
discussions would not proceed while a long list of legally required actions to
mitigate and compensate the adverse impacts of Belo Monte continues to be
ignored by Norte Energia. A first phase of the earthen dams has already had
negative consequences for indigenous peoples, especially on water quality and
devastation of fisheries.
""Nobody understood anything that the technicians said,
and they didn't have any answers to our questions,"" explained Giliarde Juruna,
a leader of the Juruna tribe from the Paquiçamba territory immediately
downstream from the dam. ""They didn't know how to respond when we asked them
how we would bathe or how we would navigate on the river, or even how the
project had changed since they presented it to us last year. In the end, the
engineers agreed that our complaints were justified.""
""There was a climate of total disbelief on behalf of
the tribes, since Norte Energia recognized it had yet to implement the vast
majority of the legally-required measures to minimize the impacts of the
project on their lands,"" explained Thais Santi of the Federal Public
Prosecutor's Office in Altamira, who was an observer at the meeting. ""At a
certain level, even the engineers recognized that the dam is an absurdity, that
the consultation was a sham, and that the mitigation projects presented by the
company's technical team didn't make any sense,"" noted Santi.
According to tribal leaders, the engineers will remain
under detention until Norte Energia and government agencies have fully carried
out promises to mitigate and compensate adverse impacts of Belo Monte, not only
in relation to boat traffic, but also in terms of water quality, sanitation,
and protection of their territories and natural resources.
On Monday, the Federal Public Prosecutors' Office filed a
lawsuit calling for the immediate suspension of the construction license for Belo Monte, which was granted in June 2011 by the
federal environmental agency IBAMA. Citing an abundance of evidence - including
reports produced by IBAMA and municipal governments and well-documented
complaints files by local indigenous leaders and NGOs - the lawsuit demands
that project construction at Belo Monte be immediately halted, given the
chronic non-compliance of Norte Energia with legally-required mitigation and
compensation measures.
""It's an outrage that Norte Energia has been allowed
to continue construction for over a year while ignoring basic measures they are
obliged to carry out in order to avoid or minimize impacts on affected
communities. The developer is ignoring the impacts the project is already
having on indigenous people and, in the process, running roughshod over their rights,""
said Brent Millikan of International Rivers.
Last month, over 300 indigenous people from 9 tribes occupied the Belo Monte Dam construction site on the final day of the United Nations Rio+20
conference, maintaining the occupation for 21 days until Norte Energia stated
it had reached an agreement with the occupiers. The tribal leaders involved in
yesterday's action claim that an agreement was never reached, and that the
developer has instead created divisions among the communities. 
The Norte Energia consortium, while technically a
""private"" enterprise, is dominated by the Brazilian
state-owned energy conglomerate Eletrobras. Major investments come from the public employee
pension funds of Petrobras, Banco do Brasil and Caixa Econômica Federal, all
entities under government control. The mining giant Vale - privatized in the
mid-1990s but still highly influenced by the Brazilian government - purchased a
9% stake in the NESA consortium in 2011. 80% of project
financing for Belo Monte's mushrooming budget - currently estimated at US$12 billion - comes from
the government-controlled development bank BNDES, financed by worker taxes and
Brazilian treasury bonds.

London ",“World’s favorite bank” HSBC “left U.S. vulnerable to dirty money”,HSBC ,United Kingdom,,,,"

According to the chair of a U.S. Senate
subcommittee, HSBC's ""pervasively polluted"" culture allowed money launderers,
drug dealers and suspected terrorists to move their money through the U.S.
financial system. Today, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI)
will hold a hearing exposing HSBC's North American banking units alleged
failure to curb financial crime, and the failure of banking regulators to
address this.
Global Witness has consistently highlighted the
reluctance of major banks to turn away suspect funds, and today's hearing will
provide more evidence of this. Global Witness' investigations have detailed how
weaknesses in the global anti-money laundering system have allowed corrupt politicians
to move their illicitly-acquired loot with a high degree of impunity.
""Profit seems to trump responsibility; if these allegations
are true, HSBC's failure to comply with money laundering laws has left the U.S.
financial system wide open to terrorist finance, as well as the proceeds of
corruption, tax evasion and other crimes,"" said Stefanie Ostfeld, a Policy
Advisor with Global Witness. ""HSBC shouldn't be anyone's favorite bank given the massive
and sustained flaws alleged by the committee"". 
A report released to coincide with the hearing provides
details of HSBC's failings: Between 2007 and 2008 HSBC Mexico moved $7bn into
the U.S. Both Mexican and U.S. authorities warned that these bulk cash shipments
could only reach that volume if they included illegal drug proceeds.HSBC provided
services to banks in Saudi Arabia and Bangladesh despite their links to
terrorist financing.The bank offered more than 2,000 accounts to companies with
bearer shares, despite the difficult of tracing the ownership of these sorts of
accounts and the high money laundering risk they pose. 
In the aftermath of September 11, Congress strengthened
U.S. laws intended to combat terrorism and money laundering. Banks have a legal
obligation to perform ""due diligence"" to identify their customers and report suspicious
activity to the authorities.
Despite these stronger laws, banks have
consistently failed to seriously tackle money laundering. Over the last decade,
U.S. bank regulators have told HSBC multiple times to fix deficiencies in its
anti-money laundering systems.
The PSI report is also critical of the role played
by HSBC's regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The regulator
failed to use either formal or informal enforcement actions to compel improvements
in HSBC's compliance program, despite mounting evidence of HSBC's failings.
In addition to the Senate, HSBC is under
investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice, NY County District Attorney's
Office, Office of Foreign Assets Control, Federal Reserve, Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency and the Internal Revenue Service, according to an
SEC filing. According to one report, HSBC may be facing a fine of up to $1
billion.
It is unlikely that HSBC is the only bank failing
in its anti-money laundering compliance program responsibilities. Global
Witness investigations have detailed banks in major financial centers doing
business with corrupt senior officials from Nigeria, Angola, Turkmenistan,
Liberia, Equatorial Guinea and Republic of Congo. Last year, a study by the
British financial regulator found that banks in the UK were systematically failing
to carry out the required anti-money laundering checks, particularly when
dealing with customers where there was a high risk of corruption. There is no
evidence to suggest that the situation in other financial centers, including
the U.S., is any different.
""The current system is broken. Banks are not doing enough
to turn away dirty money and the regulators aren't doing enough to make them,""
said Ostfeld. ""Banks need to take financial crime seriously so that they don't
facilitate money laundering, drug running and terrorism. Our regulators need to
make it very clear that the sort of behavior displayed by HSBC is unacceptable.
The worst offenders should face criminal sanctions"".  
Global Witness is calling on HSBC to strengthen its
anti-money laundering compliance program and to carry out and publish an external
audit of how well they are managing money laundering risk.
Global Witness is calling on the U.S. Government
to: Ensure U.S. anti-money laundering laws and regulations are being
robustly enforced, including by issuing punitive fines when banks fail to do
this, as U.S. authorities have done for banks that facilitate evading taxes and
sanctions. If HSBC is found to have major breaches in anti-money laundering
compliance, the U.S. bank regulators should issue serious fines and consider
criminal prosecution of individuals.Close loopholes in the U.S. anti-money laundering
framework, including explicitly requiring banks to obtain information about the
ultimate, or beneficial, owner for all company accounts, and to consider
whether the ownership structure is reasonable in light of the commercial
activities and profile of the account holder.Banks should also be required to perform
extra checks on the accounts of all senior foreign politicians and officials
(referred to as politically exposed persons) and not just those with private
bank accounts with deposits of more than $1 million, as is the case at the
moment. Advocate that Congress pass legislation that would require companies to
disclose their beneficial ownership information at the point of incorporation,
as hidden company ownership enables corrupt dictators, drug traffickers and
other criminals to disguise their identities, and therefore their dirty money,
behind anonymous shell companies in order to access the financial system. The
White House committed to do this in the U.S. National Action Plan of the Open
Government Partnership and the Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized
Crime.
Global Witness is available to provide comment and
context about this hearing.

Notes to editors
 
1. The hearing, ""U.S. Vulnerabilities to Money
Laundering, Drugs, and Terrorist Financing: HSBC
Case History,"" is on
Tuesday, July 17, 2012, at 9:30 a.m., in Room 106
of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. The Subcommittee released a report to
accompany the hearing.
2. Global Witness and the FACT Coalition will host a
joint press conference on Tuesday, July 17th following the hearing.
This will be at 3:00 PM, or, if the
hearing concludes after 2:30 PM, 30 minutes after the conclusion of the
hearing. The venue is Mott House, 122 Maryland Avenue NE, Washington, DC (Across
the street from the Dirksen Senate Office Building).
3. Representatives from HSBC, the US Treasury
Department and a financial regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency, will discuss how high risk clients of HSBC's U.S. affiliate accessed
the financial system. This allegedly left the U.S. vulnerable to drug
trafficking, money laundering and terrorist financing.
4. In October 2010, the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency (OCC) found that HSBC Bank USA had multiple deficiencies in its
anti-money laundering compliance program. According to the OCC these
deficiencies included ""inadequate collection and analysis of CDD information,
including inadequate monitoring of PEPs"" and poor monitoring of suspicious
activity and correspondent funds transfer activity, leading to ""a significant
potential for unreported money laundering or terrorist financing.""
5. In February 2012, HSBC stated in an SEC filing that
it was being investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice, NY County District
Attorney's Office, Office of Foreign Assets Control, Federal Reserve, Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency, Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Senate
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations for multiple issues, including
compliance with U.S. anti-money laundering laws, the Bank Secrecy Act, economic
sanctions and tax and securities laws.
6. A February 2010 PSI report shined a spotlight on how failures
by American banks had enabled the proceeds of foreign corruption to enter the
U.S. The report found that HSBC staff facilitated suspicious wire transfers
into the country for the Angolan Central Bank. Other banks, including Bank of
America and Wells Fargo, flagged these transfers as suspicious and ultimately
didn't accept them as they had concerns about moving money from an Angolan
government account to a private individual's account. The report, Keeping
Foreign Corruption Out of the
United States: Four Case Histories is available
here.
7. In November 2009 Global Witness' report The Secret Life of a Shopaholic exposed major
weaknesses in the American anti-money laundering regime, particularly the rules
on wire transfers, that are supposed to keep dirty money-whether from
corruption, terrorism or narcotics-out of the financial system. The report
revealed that banks including Wachovia, Bank of America and UBS, allowed Teodorin
Obiang, son of the president of oil-rich Equatorial Guinea, to bring $75
million into the U.S between 2005 and 2007.

The Hague, The netherlands ",Pension funds and banks invest millions in companies that supply controversial communication systems to Syria,ING ,Netherlands,,,,"

Dutch bankgroups and pension funds invest in
two companies that in that past year have supplied radio equipment to Syrian
police, and a data-storage system for internet control to the Syrian
authorities. This research is commissioned by Oxfam Novib and IKV Pax Christi
and covers the Italian company Finmeccanica - that already in 2011, came into
disrepute due to arms supplies to Libya - and the American company Netapp.
The research was
conducted by Dutch economic research centre Profundo, and shows that fourteen
Dutch financial institutions invest in one or both companies. Last year,
similar research commissioned  by the
Dutch Fair Bank Guide proved that Finmeccanica supplied the Libyan dictator
Kadaffi with arms. Even then Dutch banks and pension funds were investing in
this company. Spokesperson Peter Ras from Oxfam Novib: ""It
is
disheartening to see that financial institutions continue to invest in companies that support dictators. Apparently, many financial institutions have not learned from the misery in Libya and
their policies have not improved.
This needs to happen now.""
The Italian arms
company Finmeccanica supplied
mobile communication equipment to the
Syrian police in May 2011. This
was two months after the uprising
broke out in Syria. In 2007, Finmeccanica supplied
Syria with an advanced radar system. In May 2012 the U.S. government launched an investigation into the delivery of the data storage system of the U.S. electronics
company Netapp to Syria in
2011. The system is
part of a large web control system. With this system all internet movements of opponents of the regime can be followed.
Miriam Struyk of IKV
Pax Christi: ""Even communication as provided by Finmeccanica and Netapp is unfortunately a very effective weapon to suppress civilians."" In March 2011 a popular uprising against the Syrian dictatorship broke out and  led to the loss of at least
10.000 lives.
ING bank and Aegon bank have announced that they are
willing to investigate where and how their current arms policy needs to be
tightened in order to prevent such cases of arms trade. Moreover, additional
research shows that there are more ICT companies supplying regimes such as that
in Syria with equipment. This obviously calls for more structural change and
tightening of current investors' arms policy.
Oxfam Novib
and IKV Pax Christi call on all bank
groups and pension funds that invest
in these companies to withdraw their investments. They should
also improve and structurally tighten their policies on
arms trade with repressive regimes
and supply of equipment that can strengthen repression. Finally, greater transparency about their investments and about time-bound 'engagement' with (weapon) companies is needed. "

Argentina ",Barrick Gold Suffers Legal Defeat in Argentine Supreme Court Glacier Protection Law Holds and Mining Companies Must Reveal Impacts,,,Pascua Lama gold mining project ,mining - non coal,Argentina,"
Barrick Gold, the company that had proposed dynamiting glaciers and hauling them off in dump trucks to enable it to access gold reserves at its Pascua Lama project, suffered a major setback today in the Argentine National Supreme Court. An injunction order originally granted to Barrick by a local federal circuit court judge suspending the recently approved National Glacier Act was terminally revoked. The glacier law is now back in full force for Barrick and other mining companies operating in Argentina.Mining companies investing in exploration activities all along the Andes mountains were quietly awaiting the ruling by the Argentine Supreme Court, which issued an 8 page verdict today stating firmly that the glacier law holds and Barrick and a slew of other mining companies exploring for minerals in the high Andes mountains will now have to file glacier impact reports on their operations and adhere to the law. If they are found to be in glacier areas or impacting glaciers, according to the law, they will have to redesign their projects-or worse, pack their bags and go home. Barrick's Veladero project and the not-yet-extracting Pascua Lama project (a binational project with Chile) both fall under the scope of the law and would have to produce glacier impact studies to continue operations.The verdict, labeled Complainant: Barrick Gold Exploraciones Argentina, S.A. and others vs. the National Government, reversed a previous court order in 2011 from federal circuit court judge Galvez in San Juan province which favored the Canadian mining giant, stating that the National Glacier Act created a state of ""uncertainty"" and ""lack of tranquility"" for mining companies operating in glacier zones, where the national law states clearly that mining shall not impact glaciers or periglacial environments (permafrost). The problem for mining projects in provinces like San Juan or La Rioja is that much of the terrain above 4,000 meters is where the vast majority of new projects are searching for minerals in the high Andes mountains.The Supreme Court slapped circuit court judge Galvez on the wrist, stating that his granting of the injunction was poorly justified. The Supreme Court says National laws can only be suspended when the originating concerns are severe-not the case, they say, for the mining companies, which simply have to ensure they are not impacting glaciers or permafrost. The National Glacier Inventory must be carried out, says the Supreme Court, and then we'll see what that means for the mining companies.The earlier verdict granted to Barrick (a similar injunction request was granted to Xstrata Copper), which had effectively suspended the National Glacier Act for companies such as Barrick Gold (Pascua Lama and Veladero) and Xstrata Copper (El Pachón), was a great windfall for several hundred exploratory mining projects in the high Andes mountains. This not only includes San Juan province but also high altitude provinces such as La Rioja, Catamarca, Jujuy, Salta, and Mendoza, where glaciers and permafrost abound. The doubt remains, hence, what the strict ruling will mean for companies whose concessions are surrounded by or coincide with glaciers and more generally with frozen grounds (permafrost), which are also protected by the law. At first glance, these companies will have to prove they are not impacting glaciers or permafrost or risk being in regulatory trouble.Many other mining companies such as NGEx Resources (Vicuña, Las Flechas, José Maria), McEwen Mining (Los Azules), Peregrine Metals (El Altar), Glencore (Aguilar), Malbex (Del Carmen), Anglo American (Cerro Verde), Osisko (Famatina) and many others, were betting that less stringent provincial glacier protection laws, which cover fewer types of glaciers and some of which do not protect permafrost zones, would prevail over the national law-which is the strictest of a dozen or so glaciers laws that have appeared in the last two years.The Supreme Court verdict specifies that the National Glacier Law rightly and justly calls for a National Glacier Inventory to determine what areas should be protected by the law and where mining activity might be affecting glaciers and periglacial environments. The fear from the mining sector and from the provincial government, which has been betting on mining for developing its economy, is more than warranted. Recently the national glacier institute, the IANIGLA, revealed its first official inventory results for the Mendoza River, an uncontroversial area rich in glaciers but where no mining is planned. The IANIGLA came out loudly, indicating specifically that in the zones surrounding the more than 1,600 glaciers in the Mendoza River basin, mining is now prohibited. The official statement by the IANIGLA was a bucket of ice thrown at the mining sector, as it is a clear indicator confirming that the National Glacier Act will begin to set no-go zones for mining operations due to potential glacier and permafrost impacts.The verdict also emphasizes the responsibility of mining companies to produce within 180 days of the passage of the National Glacier Act a detailed glacier impact study to determine if the glacier law applies to the project in question. This includes projects already under operation, making the National Glacier Act retroactive for projects such as Barrick's Veladero gold mine.Finally the court throws out corporate concerns that the National Glacier Act might hinder mining activity, orders that the National Glacier Inventory be carried out and calls on Barrick to submit to a glacier impact study, after which it shall be determined how the National Glacier Law applies to Barrick.For more information:Jorge Daniel TaillantCenter for Human Rights and Environment (CEDHA)jdtaillant@cedha.org.arlink to the verdict:http://wp.cedha.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Fallo-Barrick-Revocación-de-cautelar.pdf (in Spanish only)link to the Argentine National Glacier Act (unofficial English Translation) "

United States of America ",New report details risks of China Development Bank’s increasing global footprint, Development Bank ,China,Shwe gas and pipelines projects ,oil and gas,Myanmar,"
The China Development Bank is rapidly becoming an important player in international development finance, but it currently lacks the environmental and social standards that are expected of a world-class financial institution.
That is the conclusion of a report (and summary in Chinese) released today by Friends of the Earth – United States and BankTrack, an international network of civil society organisations tracking the operations of the financial sector. The report, China Development Bank’s Overseas Investments, is the third report related to the Chinese banking sector that the two organizations have jointly published.
China Development Bank is now the world’s largest development bank by total assets (almost USD 1 trillion) and China’s biggest lender, financing cross-border transactions and investment in over 90 countries and regions. The report describes the bank’s global footprint, and identifies the ways in which the bank raises and disburses financing.
It also describes the bank’s environmental and social financing policies, and includes case studies describing the on-the-ground reality faced by communities around the world who are impacted by CDB’s transactions.
“From the Shwe gas project in Burma, to tar sands development in Canada, and illegal logging in Indonesia, CDB is involved in ‘Dodgy Deals’ around the globe,” said Johan Frijns, Director of BankTrack, which keeps an inventory of controversial bank-financed transactions on its website. “It is clear that CDB’s policies are not doing nearly enough to protect communities and the environment.”
The report also points out that the China Banking Regulatory Commission’s new Green Credit Policy Directive requires banks to uphold international best practice in overseas deals. Released in February 2012, the Directive is the latest guidance from the Chinese banking regulator to steer bank lending towards environmentally responsible activities.
“In order to fulfill its duties as a prominent international bank, as well as comply with new Chinese banking regulations, CDB must make significant strides in implementing international best practices,” said Michelle Chan, Director of Economic Policy Programs at Friends of the Earth – US. “Like other international banks, CDB needs to develop strong safeguards for environmentally and socially sensitive transactions, be much more transparent on how it conducts its operations and include local communities and other stakeholders in decision-making on investments that affect their legitimate interests.”
Recently the CDB released its 2011 corporate social responsibility report, which was not included the Friends of the Earth/ BankTrack analysis. However, CDB’s new report shows that the bank’s overseas financing continues to increase, along with its portfolio of environmental lending. Today, CDB is a leading financier of environmental projects at both home and overseas; for example, it provides major support for the expansion of Chinese companies into renewable wind and solar energy abroad.
“CDB’s concerted efforts to finance environmentally beneficial activities shows that the bank has tremendous potential to catalyze ecologically and socially sustainable development,” said Chan. “By working hand-in-hand with stakeholders, including Chinese civil society, CDB has the potential to show global leadership in this area.” "

Washington DC ","New Report Shows Days of Cheap, Affordable Coal Fired Power are Over",,,,,,"
Today, the Sierra Club released a new study, revealing that the days of cheap, affordable coal fired power are now over. The report, Locked In: The Financial Risks of New Coal-Fired Power Plants in Today’s Volatile International Coal Market, challenges the traditional view that coal is a cheap and reliable energy option for countries around the world. At a time when coal-fired power is at a historic low in the US and the EU, the report warns of developing countries locking themselves into coal plant investments that face significant financial risk from rising costs.
Authored by Bruce Buckheit, former Director of the EPA’s Air Enforcement Office, the report upends a common argument in favor of coal investment – that it is cheap and affordable. Rather, the report highlights the rising costs of coal plant construction, rising global coal prices, and the emergence of an “Organization of Coal Exporting Countries” (OCEC) -- all of which make electricity from coal-fired power plants inherently risky and unaffordable for countries around the world.
“Environmental and public health concerns aside, the truth is coal is just a lousy financial investment,” says Justin Guay, Washington Representative for the Sierra Club. “Policymakers and financial institutions need to catch up to this 21st century reality - coal is no longer affordable.”
According to the report, the primary factor affecting the viability of coal-fired power plant projects is increasing costs. Construction cost overruns of up to 100% have become common-place while coal prices continue to rise around the world. The latter is exacerbated by an emerging OCEC that dominates a highly concentrated global coal market. The top two producers alone - Australia and Indonesia - account for more than 50% of global coal exports, providing ample opportunity for maintaining high coal prices.  Often prevented from passing on these costs to consumers due to domestic regulatory structures, coal plant investments in China and India retain maximum exposure to these cost fluctuations which puts significant pressure on profit margins, making them extremely risky investments. 
The fallout from these rising costs is already evident around the world.  In India, the 4GW Tata Mundra Ultra-Mega Power Plant project is seeking to be released from its long-term power purchase agreements in the face of billions of dollars in losses, before it has even completed construction.  In the United States, the recently-completed Spiritwood Station coal plant in North Dakota has opted to remain idle rather than operate at a loss. 
“We are seeing a rise in non-performing coal assets around the world,” says Guay. “These risky investments force average citizens to pay the price for increasingly expensive coal fired power.”
Compounding these problems is the opportunity cost of the alternative – clean, renewable energy. Leading competitors such as wind energy and solar photovoltaic (PV) panels are experiencing plummeting prices and rapidly becoming competitive with coal fired power.  The report documents that the cost of power from solar PV has fallen by over 60% since 2008, while new wind power can provide energy at 5-10 cents/kWh, making it competitive with coal in any market.
“Clean energy is increasingly competitive around the world,’ says Guay. “Countries and financial institutions that lock themselves into coal investments are exposed to the risk volatile international fuel markets – something clean energy investments avoid.”
Ultimately, the report argues that avoiding ‘lock-in’ to new coal fired power plant investments requires assuming that coal prices will rise, using accurate discount rates, and establishing a risk premium for any proposed coal plant investment. The combination of these measures can help shield financial institutions from the increasing risks associated with coal.

Bangkok, Thailand ",Ch. Karnchang Plows Forward with Xayaburi Dam Construction,,,Xayaburi dam ,energy plants - dams,Laos,"
Bangkok, Thailand – A recent investigation of the Xayaburi Dam site by International Rivers revealed that Thai company Ch. Karnchang has already undertaken significant resettlement and construction activities, contrary to claims that only preliminary work is underway.  Despite Ch. Karnchang’s recent statements that it will comply with the Lao government’s commitment to postpone construction until there is regional agreement, International Rivers found construction activities underway during a visit last week to the dam site and 15 affected villages. Recent activities include dredging to deepen and widen the riverbed at the dam site, the construction of a large concrete retaining wall, and an increase in the company’s local labor force. One village, Houay Souy, was already resettled from the dam’s planned spillway to near Xayaboury town in January 2012.  Ame Trandem, Southeast Asia Program Director for International Rivers, said, “By proceeding with resettlement and construction on the Xayaburi Dam, Ch. Karnchang has blatantly defied the diplomatic process underway to decide on the future of the Mekong River. The company has violated the trust of the governments of Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, with apparent impunity.”  On June 2, Mr. Aswin Kongsiri, Chairperson of the Ch. Karnchang Board of Directors told the Bangkok Post that “the Lao government will ultimately make the final decision on whether the project will go ahead, but we want to wait for all stakeholders in the Greater Mekong Subregion to agree with it.” Mr. Aswin indicated that the company had not yet started construction, stating “we have thus focused on project preparation, mainly financing and the environmental impact report.”  These claims came weeks after the Lao government publicly announced that dam construction had been postponed and only “preliminary construction” such as building access roads had taken place.  “So far, Ch Karnchang claims that they are only going forward with ‘preliminary construction’ on the project, but the definition of ‘preliminary’ keeps expanding,” said Kirk Herbertson, Mekong Campaigner for International Rivers. “Ripping up the riverbed and resettling entire villages cannot be considered a preliminary activity.”  Interviews with resettled families from Houay Souy revealed a series of broken promises made by Ch. Karnchang. Resettled households have yet to receive new agricultural land and have been required to spend much of their own compensation money to finish building the houses that were provided to them. Ch. Karnchang also reneged on a promise to provide one year of free electricity and water. Instead villagers were provided only one month free. The company has informed other villages that they will be moved as soon as December 2012, but said they will not compensate the villagers for the loss of fisheries, access to agricultural land, gold panning, and other major sources of food and income, in violation of Lao law.  Teerapong Pomun, Director of Thai NGO Living River Siam, who joined the trip to the dam site, said, “Even at this early stage, the Xayaburi Dam is causing harm to local people and the environment. Ch. Karnchang needs to be held accountable for its irresponsible and illegal behavior. It’s only a matter of time before the damage to the river’s ecosystem and fisheries begins to impact downstream countries like Thailand, something the company has failed to even take into account.”  On June 28-29, the governments of the Mekong River Commission (MRC) will meet with development partners in Vientiane, Laos for the MRC’s Informal Donor Meeting 2012. The issue of the Mekong mainstream dams is expected to be on the agenda.  “Ch. Karnchang’s ongoing construction activities are creating conflict among the Mekong countries,” said Mr. Herbertson. “No construction should be allowed that places future cooperation along the Mekong River in jeopardy. It’s time for the Thai and Lao governments to hold firm to their commitments and require Ch. Karnchang to respect the diplomatic process.”  In addition to Ch. Karnchang’s role, Thailand has close links to the Xayaburi Dam. The project is being financed by Thai commercial banks. An estimated 95% of the dam’s electricity would be sold to Thailand. In July, communities from eight Thai provinces along the Mekong River are expected to bring a lawsuit against the Thai government for signing an agreement to purchase the dam’s electricity in violation of their constitutional rights.

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil ",BankTrack position on the Natural Capital Declaration,,,,,,"
BankTrack today issued its 'Position on the Natural Capital Declaration' on the occasion of the official launch of the Natural Capital Declaration at the Rio+20 Summit In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
BankTrack welcomes any initiative by the financial sector that univocally acknowledges the inherent value of nature, as well as the limits posed to their business activities by the environmental carrying capacity of the earth. We equally welcome any sufficiently ambitious, credible initiative of the sector to factor this fundamental recognition into their business and investment decisions.
BankTrack considers the Natural Capital Declaration not such an initiative, but a false and disturbing response of the financial sector to the profound ecological crises of today. It is based upon a fatally flawed understanding of the root causes of these crises (imperfect valuation of ‘Natural Capital and Ecosystem Services’) and proposes an equally flawed solution to them (proper pricing).
The Declaration claims the fundamental right of business, and the adopting institutions in particular, to enter every realm of nature and the environment and to identify, price and subsequently market whatever ‘stock’ and ‘service’ can be identified there, under the pretext that this commodification process will help end the ongoing plunder and exploitation of nature. As such, the Declaration is another attempt to promote the liberal, market based ‘green economy’ model sought by business as outcome of the Rio conference.
BankTrack believes that the manifold ecological crises need a wholy different response: instead of expanding the scope of markets to every domain of nature, creating a true green economy would start from the opposite; reversing the tide of commodification and financialisation, reducing the role of markets and the financial sector, acknowledging the limits of business versus other spheres of life, and recognising the collective responsibility of all people for, and strengthening the democratic control over the worlds’ ecological commons. Rather than a Natural Capital Declaration we need more Nature without Capital.
Instead of launching a vaguely worded voluntary initiative with no immediate discernible impact on everyday investment decisions, we call upon the financial sector to withdraw itself from where it has no rightful place, to adopt strict no-go standards for all business activities that wreak havoc upon nature, climate, the environment and people, and to throw its full weight behind those sectors and initiatives that help preserve, protect and restore the life giving capacity of the earth.

Brussels ",World’s leading banks invest in cluster bomb producers,Allianz ,Germany,,,,"
Worldwide, 137 private and public financial institutions continue to invest almost US$43 billion into producers of banned cluster munitions. Leading financial investors and loan providers include: Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and China Merchants Bank.
The detail and extent of global explosive investments is shown in the 2012 report: “Worldwide Investments in Cluster Munitions; a shared responsibility”. The report by IKV Pax Christi (the Netherlands) and FairFin (Belgium), was released today in Berlin, to put pressure on Germany and other governments to legislate against these kinds of explosive investments.
Like landmines, cluster munitions are banned under international law because they kill indiscriminately. The report looks at financial investments into a short list of companies known for production of cluster munitions. These include : Alliant Techsystems (USA), Hanwha (South Korea), Lockheed Martin (USA), Norinco (China), Poongsan (South Korea), Singapore Technologies Engineering (Singapore), Splav (Russia), and Textron (USA).
Although many states and financial institutions have spoken out against these investments, the worldwide study shows that in the last three years financial institutions:
•     provided loans for a total of at least US$4.1 billion;
•     provided investment banking services worth a total of at least US$8.1 billion; and
•     owned or managed shares and bonds for at least US$30.4 billion.
“After all the financial scandals, crisis and promises to act in a more responsible and transparent way, it is a disgrace that financial institutions continue to invest in banned weapons,” said Roos Boer, co-author of the report for IKV Pax Christi (the Netherlands). “Investing in banned weapons is ethically unacceptable and it is time for governments and banks to ban these explosive investments,”  she added.
The majority of the financial institutions that invest in cluster munition producers is from countries that have not yet joined the international treaty which bans cluster bombs. Also of concern, the report demonstrates that there are still 27 financial institutions from countries which have joined the convention that still invest in cluster munition producers.
As well as a “Hall of Shame”, the report also includes examples of good company and national practice. In the “Hall of Fame” and “runners-up” category, 56 financial institutions are credited for disinvesting from cluster munition producers, This is up from 47 last year.
Financial institutions with a comprehensive policy to disinvest from cluster munition producers are listed in the Hall of Fame. Newcomers in the 2012 report’s Hall of Fame include: the Australian Future Fund, the Luxembourg Compensation Fund, SNS REAAL (the Netherlands) and WestLB (Germany). These financial institutions exclude all financial links to cluster munition producers.
The runners-up lists financial institutions with disinvestment policies, but which still have some loopholes in their policy. Newcomers in this year’s runners-up category include:  AEGON (the Netherlands), Aviva (United Kingdom), Intesa Sanpaolo (Italy), Lloyds Banking Group (United Kingdom), Société Générale (France), and Royal Bank of Scotland (United Kingdom).
All the positive examples are from financial institutions based in countries which have signed the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM). “We see that more and more financial institutions are starting to disinvest from cluster munition producers,” said Stijn Suijs, co-author of the report for FairFin (Belgium), “But we are still seeing too many loopholes in company policies that should be closed because clients do not want their money to go to cluster munitions”, he added.
The report also gives insight to the new and unprecedented development of states legislating against investments in cluster munitions. Most recently Italy was added to the list of states that introduced legislation to ban (forms of) investment in these weapons. At the moment, 5 countries have such legislation in place: Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, and New Zealand. In 2012 draft legislation was tabled in the Netherlands and Switzerland furthermore. 21 other states that signed the CCM did not legislate (yet) but did make their view clear that they consider investments to be prohibited by the Convention.
The report is launched in Germany where activists in Munich and Berlin are calling for disinvestment today. Two major German financial institutions (Allianz and Deutsche Bank) are mentioned in the report for their investments in cluster munition producers. Germany has no legislation to ban investments in cluster munitions yet.
“We call upon Germany to legislate against investments in cluster munitions and provide clear guidelines for financial institutions. If countries around Germany like Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg and in the near future Switzerland and the Netherlands can do it, so can Germany”, said Boer.
The report was commissioned, written and edited by IKV Pax Christi and FairFin, who commissioned economic research consultancy Profundo (the Netherlands) to find data for the Hall of Shame section of the report.

KEY NOTES: ON CLUSTER MUNITIONS
•     Cluster munitions are large weapons which are deployed from the air and from the ground and release dozens or hundreds of smaller submunitions. Submunitions released by air-dropped cluster bombs are most often called “bomblets,” while those delivered from the ground by artillery or rockets are usually referred to as “grenades.”
•     37 countries and territories are known to be affected by cluster munitions from use in armed conflict: Afghanistan, Albania, Angola, Azerbaijan, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cambodia, Chad, Chechnya, Croatia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Falklands/Malvinas, Georgia, Grenada, Iraq, Israel, Kosovo, Kuwait, Lao PDR, Lebanon, Mauritania, Montenegro, Mozambique, Nagorno-Karabakh, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Tajikistan, Thailand Uganda, Vietnam, Western Sahara, Zambia, Yemen.
•     18 countries have used cluster munitions: Colombia, Eritrea, Ethiopia, France, Georgia, Israel, Libya, Morocco, The Netherlands, Nigeria, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Former Yugoslavia (Serbia), Sudan, Thailand, United Kingdom, United States.
KEY NOTES: ON THE CONVENTION ON CLUSTER MUNITIONS 
•     On August 1st, 2010, the Convention on Cluster Munitions entered into force and became binding under international law. As of May 2012, 111 countries had signed the Convention and 71 had ratified. 
•     The Convention bans the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of clustermunitions. The international Cluster Munition Coalition (CMC) and an increasing number of countries
•     interpret the prohibition on assistance with the production/development of cluster munitions as described in Article 1(1)c as a ban on investments.
 
KEY NOTES: ON THE REPORT “WORLDWIDE INVESTMENTS IN CLUSTER MUNITIONS; A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY”
•     IKV Pax Christi (the Netherlands) and FairFin (formerly Netwerk Vlaanderen, Belgium) published the first report on “Worldwide Investments in Cluster Munitions: a Shared Responsibility” in October 2009. It was the first comprehensive state-of-the-art report on financial institutions' investment in companies that develop or produce cluster munitions, on financial institutions disinvesting from producers of cluster munitions and on states banning investments in cluster munitions. The research for the Hall of Shame in this report was done by economic research consultancy Profundo (the Netherlands). Updates of the report appeared in April 2010 and May 2011. This edition, dated June 2012, updates the earlier reports.
•     “Worldwide investments in cluster munitions; a Shared Responsibility” highlights good practices of financial institutions and countries that disinvest, and provides information on financial institutions that are still investing in cluster munitions.

Tokyo, Japan ",Greenpeace report rebukes finance sector for ignoring nuclear risks,,,,,,"
Investors in nuclear power are being sold precarious and potentially damaging investments because the industry’s risks are regularly being overlooked or underestimated, a new report from Greenpeace has found.
Compiled with the help of BankTrack, the environmental organisation’s Toxic Assets report highlights the fact that vast sums of money have already been lost and investors are at risk of future losses as the industry and ratings agencies consistently underestimate, ignore and conceal major problems from shareholders and creditors.
The Greenpeace report also argues that not only can these investments prove to be equally toxic as radioactive contamination following a nuclear accident, their worth is also being gradually eroded by aging plants, growing costs, falling utilisation rates, changing regulations and shrinking government support.
Using the enormous economic losses surrounding the triple meltdown at TEPCO’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant as an example, Toxic Assets (1) shows how financial valuations and investment decisions had not taken well-known and systemic problems into account.
Crucial vulnerabilities in reactor design, major frauds, cover-ups and governance issues; collusion and loose regulatory supervision; and well-understood natural disaster warnings were all ignored and hidden from investors. This is a common and continuing theme, not just in Japan, but globally.
“All of these warnings had been publically highlighted for years, often decades, before the nuclear disaster, but at best they were never taken seriously by credit agencies, analysts, or regulators. At worst, these alarm bells were ignored and covered up to preserve the false impression that nuclear power is a good investment,” said György Dallos, Greenpeace International Senior Energy Investments Advisor.
“Not only did credit rating agencies and financial analysts not inform shareholders about the risks of their investments, they routinely failed to draw the right conclusions in their valuations, ratings and recommendations – even after major scandals such as the 2002 TEPCO maintenance video frauds.” (2)
In the wake of the Fukushima disaster, TEPCO lost 90% of its market capitalisation, had its bonds rated as junk and is currently in the process of being at least partly nationalised. As a result, investors and financiers of nuclear utilities and nuclear vendors all over the world have also seen their investments eroded.
Had analysts, financial advisors and ratings agencies looked beyond short-term cash flows and paid attention to the many early warnings, they would have been able to save investors from major losses.
“Fukushima Daiichi has proven that nuclear power plants are not only dangerous, but they are expensive and extremely risky investments,” said Dallos. “These plants can create liabilities that can greatly exceed asset value, yet the scope of a disaster, the risks posed by aging reactors and the higher than assumed probability of a devastating accident are not taken into consideration.”
Ayako Sekine, Greenpeace Japan Energy Campaigner, added: “New nuclear reactor builds have been a clear investor ‘no-go’ for at least a decade unless there was significant government support, and the Fukushima disaster has again highlighted the threats the technology poses to public health, the environment, and the global economy.”
“The Japanese government is again being cavalier about the threat nuclear power poses to its people, its environment and its economy, by ignoring expert advice and pushing to restart dangerous reactors. It’s time governments and the financial sector conducted proper due diligence (3) and treated nuclear energy for the toxic investment that it is,” said Sekine.
Greenpeace is an independent global campaigning organisation that acts to change attitudes and behaviour, to protect and conserve the environment, and to promote peace.

Sydney ",Investors in Australian mega coal mine proposal warned of risks,,,,,,"
This morning financial analysts across India woke up to find a huge full-page ad aimed squarely at them, warning ""don't sink your profits on the Great Barrier Reef."" The Asian Financial Times carried a full page investor alert advertisement on behalf of Greenpeace, GetUp! and BANKTRACK, warning analysts that investing in the Indian conglomerate GVK/Rinehart Alpha mega mine in Queensland’s Galilee Basin could be a minefield of risks.
The ad asks: Have you considered investing in new coal export projects in Australia? Then warns: National and international NGOs are vowing to fight these coal projects every step of the way, and then highlights key investment risks. “The risks of delays to the Alpha mega coal project were on show this week as a political fracas broke out over a botched environmental approval process by the State Government”, said Julien Vincent, Greenpeace campaigner. “This and community opposition to the project are just two of a number of serious issues about which investors should be concerned.”
“While industry analysts are beginning to cast doubt over the viability of coal export projects in Australia, the United Nations World Heritage body has also warned about the devastating impact that the coal expansion could have on the Great Barrier Reef. Anyone thinking of investing in GVK/Gina Rinehart’s Alpha coal project would want to think long and hard if they want to be associated with this potential environmental and economic  disaster,” GetUp environmental campaign director Paul Oosting said.

",Colbún Suspends HidroAysén Transmission Line,,,HidroAysén dam ,energy plants - dams,Chile,"
Well, now we know why HidroAysen has repeatedly pushed back the date for turning in the EIA for its transmission line. Yesterday, Colbun – 49% owner of HidroAysen – publicly announced that it ""wants to indefinitely suspend plans to seek environmental permission to build transmission lines to the capital""because there's a lack of political agreement in the country around energy development.
Things are moving fast in Chile in regards to dam building and the ever-growing movement to protect Patagonia.
Last month, the Supreme Court rejected the seven appeals for legal protection filed by my campaign partners in Chile. Almost immediately, people throughout Chile once again took to the streets, and started organizing events to show the Chilean government that they will not let Patagonia be destroyed for profit.
On Earth Day, at least 5,000 people gathered in Santiago to give HidroAysén a red light on building their dams in Patagonia. The afternoon was a cultural event, with many different music performances by well-known groups and local Patagonian artists.
And then on May 8, one day short of the first anniversary of the approval of the EIA for the HidroAysén dams, the same regional government body approved the first of Energia Austral's proposed dams in Patagonia, called the Rio Cuervo Dam. Read my colleague Amanda Maxwell's blog for information on the serious problems with the Rio Cuervo Dam and why it should never have been approved. The punchline? The Rio Cuervo Dam would be built smack dab inside an active earthquake zone. How active? The region saw a 6.2 earthquake only 5 years ago, which also produced a tsunami and killed 10 people.
The next day there was a protest in front of La Moneda – the presidential palace in Santiago – by the group Patagones en Santiago (Patagonians in Santiago), showing that they are nowhere near giving up on protecting the place they call home from these destructive dams. If you speak spanish, you'll enjoy this video they made of their event.
Merely two days later, the Supreme Court of Chile accepted the appeal of Rio Cuervo's approval. The project is now frozen, and Energia Austral must submit a new soil study for the dam site. The environmental review commission will then have to decide anew whether or not to approve the project. "

London ",RBS finance for tar sands revealed on eve of AGM – students protest,Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS)  ,United Kingdom,,,,"
Platform , UK Tar Sands Network  and the Indigenous Environmental Network  have revealed that in the past year the Royal Bank of Scotland underwrote bonds worth $131.25 million  for controversial Canadian tar sands pipeline company Enbridge Energy Partners . At the RBS AGM tomorrow in Edinburgh student groups are planning to protest the banks fossil fuel investments.
Enbridge Energy Partners is  the subject of intense controversy in Canada as their proposed Northern Gateway Pipeline would run through the  traditional territories of over 60 First Nations . These include the Yinka Dene Alliance  who just this month protested against Enbridge in several Canadian provinces as part of a ‘Freedom Train’. The combined lands of the Yinka Dene Alliance represent more than a quarter of the proposed Enbridge oil tanker and pipeline route, and their opposition to the pipeline is being supported by Indigenous Environmental Network (IEN), an alliance of indigenous groups across North America.
This revelation of finance deals comes on the eve of the RBS AGM at their HQ in Gogarburn on the outskirts of Edinburgh. Oil campaigners Platform say at last year’s AGM RBS promised a finance policy on fossil fuels that might have restricted funds for harmful projects such as the Enbridge Northern Gateway tar sands pipeline, but that since these claims no policy changes have been made.
The tar sands in Canada have been vehemently opposed in the UK by groups including UK Tar Sands Network, because many First Nations groups are against it and the process of making sythentic crude is much more polluting than conventional oil.
Clayton Thomas-Muller from IEN says:
“RBS continues to operate in a way that creates harm for profit. By not requiring their clients to prove that they have the Free, Prior, and Informed Consent of local Indigenous communities affected by their operations, RBS is not respecting international law, and making itself vulnerable to the effects of legal challenges and project delays.”
Mel Evans from Platform challenges:
""RBS has promised policy changes that simply have not arrived – it's now over a year since we were told we would soon see policy changes on finance for fossil fuels. The bank that is 83% publicly owned pays lip-service to improving its standards, but seems only to care for attempting to improve its image.""
Emily Coats from UKTSN comments:
“Behind its slick PR, RBS continues to finance companies setting up disastrous projects like the Enbridge Northern Gateway pipeline, which is trampling on Indigenous Rights, opening up new markets for tar sands, and further entrenching our reliance on fossil fuels. The Canadian tar sands alone could lock us into unstoppable climate change – we need to phase the industry out as soon as possible, not recklessly expand it.”
Natascha Deininger, protester from student group People & Planet says:
“RBS is 83% owned by the public. We deserve better than the dirty deals RBS is making with our money.”

London ",Out in the Cold – new report on Shell’s plans in the Arctic,,,Royal Dutch Shell ,oil and gas,Netherlands,"
Shell’s Annual General Meeting tomorrow is unlikely to go calmly. The company’s problems range from anger over excessive executive pay to spills in the Niger delta. At this time, Platform, Greenpeace and FairPensions are putting to scrutiny offshore Arctic exploration as a key direction in the company’s strategy.
The new report ‘Out in the Cold – Investor Risk in Shell’s Arctic Exploration’ details Shell’s existing and planned oil exploration and production projects in the offshore Arctic, with a focus on risks for the company’s investors. Download the report in pdf format here. The report is accompanied by an investor briefing, available here.
Shell’s extraction volumes have been going down for the past 10 years, except a 5% rise in 2010. It is no surprise, then, that among other international oil companies it is hoping to book new reserves by pushing into frontier zones such as the Arctic. Rapid reductions in ice cover (due to climate change driven by the combustion of fossil fuels) make the exploitation of newly discovered offshore resources possible at least theoretically. The Anglo-Dutch oil group is planning to drill five wells in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas this summer, and is the first major international oil company the Arctic offshore a key exploration focus, spending at least 1/7 of its overall exploration budget in Alaska in 2011.
The threats posed by the drive into Arctic waters to the fragile Polar ecosystems and the communities that depend upon them have already made many headlines. In seas that remain ice-covered for most of the year, a spill like BP’s Deepwater Horizon disaster would be catastrophic and near impossible to clean up. The financial implications are less clear. Shell has admitted to a UK parliamentary committee that it has not calculated how much a large spill would cost to clean up.
In reality, spills notwithstanding, questions remain about the medium- and long-term economic viability of offshore Arctic oil extraction. It is dependent on high oil prices and, crucially, tax breaks. Market analysts Bernstein Research have stated that in the Arctic, “development costs will be at the high side of the industry range” and “development times are likely to disappoint”.
The report highlights Shell’s failure to address key technical and management concerns in going into this risky territory:
Shell’s spill response plans are inadequate – it has not yet tested its well capping system (key equipment in    case of a well blowout) in Arctic conditions – and has stated to the parliamentary committee that it has no plans to do so.
Shell is developing an extensive partnership with Russian majority state-owned company Gazprom, with an extremely poor safety and transparency track record. Shell is yet to answer to how it plans to limit its exposure to Gazprom’s malpractice.
 In Russia Shell is also dealing with a history of cost overruns and government duress, which continues to be a concern particularly after Vladimir Putin’s return to the presidential seat.
The detailing of these and other risks to Shell’s shareholders forms the heart of the report. On this basis we shall be engaging with institutional investors over the coming year, working to highlight the threats and find a different way forward.     "

San Francisco, USA ",US banks risk public health and climate by financing coal,Bank of America ,United States,,,,"
Today Rainforest Action Network, BankTrack and the Sierra Club released the Coal Finance Report Card 2012, their third annual ranking of the largest financiers of mountaintop removal coal mining and coal-fired power plants.
The report looks at the stated policies for mountaintop removal and coal financing from each of the largest US Banks and assigns a letter grade to how well they uphold these policies based on investments, transactions and ownership of coal mining and coal burning utility companies.
Summary of bank coal policy grades

   In addition, this year’s report debuts the “Filthy Five” - the top 5 largest financiers of the US Coal industry. The list counts the number of transactions each company had with the dirtiest coal-burning utility companies and the largest mountaintop removal mining companies between January 2010 and March 2012. Bank of America was found to be the number one worst bank for financing of coal with 44 transactions. JP Morgan Chase was number 2 with 42 transactions, followed by Citi with 40 transactions, Morgan Stanley with 33 transactions and Wells Fargo with 26 transactions.
“The largest banks in the country, including Bank of America, Citi, and Wells Fargo, received failing grades today as the lead financiers of the coal industry. These banks are the ATMs for a dirty industry that is bad for health and bad for business,” said Amanda Starbuck, Director of Rainforest Action Network's Energy and Finance Program. “Coal is the ultimate subprime investment for the climate. We cannot solve climate change if banks continue to prop up this risky and outdated industry. When it comes to protecting our air and drinking water, the health of our communities, and our climate we don’t grade on a curve.”
The report sheds light on how banks with household names are complicit in polluting our air and destroying our natural resources. Mountaintop removal mining is a destructive process where mining companies blow the tops off mountains to reach a thin seam of coal. This practice has damaged or destroyed nearly 2,000 miles of streams and threatens to destroy 1.4 million acres of mountaintops and forests by 2020. In addition, the mining practice destroys Appalachian communities, the health of coalfield residents and any hope for positive economic growth.
Meanwhile, not only is coal burning responsible for one third of US carbon emissions — the main contributor to climate disruption — but it is also making us sick. Coal pollution is responsible for 13,000 premature deaths every year, more than $100 billion in annual health costs and over 200,000 asthma attacks annually. Pollution from coal-fired power plants leads to smog, which can cause chest pain, coughing, and breathing difficulties and can make conditions like bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma worse or even fatal. Today 2 out of every 5 U.S. families live in places with unsafe air.
“These banks are financing a coal industry that is threatening our health, our mountains, and the future of our planet,” said Mary Anne Hitt, Director of the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal Campaign. “Protecting the health and safety of our families is everyone’s responsibility -- including those that fund destructive and dangerous coal mining and burning. We hope this report card helps draw attention and scrutiny to those who are bankrolling some of the biggest polluters in our country.”
Through this report, RAN and the Sierra Club point to where banks are failing as energy and climate leaders. However, both organizations maintain a strong commitment to work with the companies so they may adopt and implement meaningful policies on coal.

Rainforest Action Network runs hard-hitting campaigns to break North America’s fossil fuels addiction, protect endangered forests and Indigenous rights, and stop destructive investments around the world through education, grassroots organizing, and non-violent direct action.

London ",Oil projects too far - banks & investors refuse finance for Arctic oil,,,,,,"
West LB have decided not to finance oil & gas development projects in the arctic and F & C have dropped Arctic oil explorers Cairn from their ethical portfolio.
The German corporate finance & investment bank, West LB, launched a new environmental policy in February and its guidelines are important in relation to the push by oil companies into the Arctic.
Speaking about the policy, Dustin Neuneyer, sustainability manager, group development said: “There are projects that are evidently unsustainable in an encompassing sense. For WestLB, the risks and costs are simply too high.” “The further you get into the icy regions, the more expensive  everything gets and there are risks that are hard to manage, “For example”, he said, “remediation of  any spills ‘would cost a fortune’, and natural processes by which spilt oil would be broken down  are slower or non-existent at freezing temperatures.”
West LB, a very significant debt financer of oil & gas projects, is making a powerful statement here that should make other banks - such as RBS - think about their practices. As Neuneyer states: “Other banks contacted us and are very interested in this approach andPolicy.”
The contrast between West LB and RBS is striking. Platform, along with BankTrack, Indigenous Environment Network and seven other groups, co-signed a letter to RBS in June 2011, calling on the  bank to make policies relating to five key points on greenhouse gas emissions, 'free, prior & informed consent', and lending to coal and tar sands extraction projects. The letter stated: “Our recommendations are being made with reference to significant policy shifts occurring in other international banks, in the hope that the RBS Group can be seen as being a pioneer rather than a laggard in these areas. Our recommendations are practical, possible, deliverable and, above all, necessary.” Sadly we are yet to receive a reply or see any policy outcomes from this process of engagement - hopefully they will be spurred into action by West LB's announcement.
Meanwhile F & C, one of the leading London institutional investors with an SRI fund, has decided to drop its holding of Cairn from its ethical portfolio. For several years it has held Cairn shares as part  of its Stewardship Funds, whilst pointedly refusing to hold either Shell or BP on environmental & social impact grounds. Finally, after the sustained campaign pressure on Cairn's offshore Greenland drilling - led by Greenpeace - F & C have quietly dropped Cairn from the portfolio. Karina Litvack, director of governance and sustainable investment at F & C stated in an article: “Cairn Energy has been removed from our Stewardship range of funds because of its move into Arctic drilling. We feel that the level of environmental and safety management and the levels of oversight by the Greenland Government is not sufficient to give us comfort.”
West LB, based in Dusseldorf and effectively the central savings bank of the states of Nordrhein-Westfalen and Brandenburg, has set a new benchmark for the project finance sector. Platform has contested West LB's decisions in the past - particularly over the financing of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline - but this new policy decision is a really positive step.
In collaboration with Greenpeace UK and Fair Pensions, we're are on the brink of publishing a new report and on the basis of this aim to hold a series of briefings with asset managers and analysts in the finance community in order to encourage other instutional investors and debt financers to  make oil projects in the Arctic, projects too far.

Bangkok, Thailand ",Protestors Condemn Ch. Karnchang Over Xayaburi Dam Construction,,,Xayaburi dam ,energy plants - dams,Laos,"
Coinciding with Ch. Karnchang's Annual Shareholders Meeting, dozens of protestors rallied in front of the company's headquarters in Bangkok on Tuesday, demanding a halt to all construction activities occurring on the Xayaburi Dam. Civil society groups and community representatives from villages along the Mekong River inside Thailand traveled hundreds of miles to make their voices heard. Together, their colorful affair helped to articulate the anger felt by many people whose lives and livelihoods would be impacted by the project.
""We are here today to oppose the irresponsible investment of Thailand's company in Laos. They see the Mekong as a project site to make profit, but they do not see lives. We are here today to tell them there are millions of us who will have to bare the cost of their dam,"" said Somkiat Kuenchiangsa from the Chiang Khong Conservation Group in Chiang Rai province.
Ch. Karnchang is under fire for blatantly disregarding the 1995 Mekong Agreement with their announcement last week to the Thai Stock Exchange that they had signed a $711 million construction contract with the Xayaburi Power Company. Ch. Karnchang also announced that construction on the Xayaburi Dam commenced on March 15th, 2012. This news came only months after the regional governments had agreed to postpone making a decision on whether or not to construct the project, in order to first study the transboundary impacts of the planned dams on the Mekong River.
""Ch Karnchang should stop building the Xayaburi dam and the four Thai banks that are financing the dam should immediately withdraw their investments. They need to be aware that if the dam goes forward, they will be negatively impacting the livelihoods of 60 million people who live along the river and rely on it for their survival,"" stated Changthamorn, a member of Community Council of Mekong Area in Nong Khai. ""For the people from Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos who will be affected by the dam and are not here today, we are their voice, raising our protests to the companies that are building and funding the dam.""
Tension has begun brewing regionally as business interests appear to have bypassed regional commitments and risk threatening the vitality of the Mekong River. Since last week's announcement by Ch. Karnchang, Cambodian officials have since stated that they may pursue legal action against Laos, if they unilaterally allow the Thai firm to proceed with the dam.
As the stakes rise, Ch. Karnchang's shareholders should not be at ease. This is especially true in light of the fact that there is no compelling justification for the project. While Ch. Karnchang has yet to carry out an assessment of the dam's transboundary impacts, scientific studies have shown the dam to be submerged in costs as the project will deplete fish stocks and block nutrient rich sediment from flowing to the region's rice fields.
Tuesday's protestors have thrown down the gauntlet to Ch. Karnchang: will they take their social, environmental and legal responsibilities seriously by dropping this project or will they continue on a downward spiral of risky and irresponsible corporate behavior?
 Note: Tuesday's protest was organized by The Network of Thai People in 8 Mekong Provinces. After the protestors were able to submit a letter of their concerns to a Ch. Karnchang official, they moved their protests to Siam Commercial Bank's headquarters in Bangkok . As one of the four Thai Banks funding the project, the protestors then submitted a second letter calling for the bank to end its funding for the Xayaburi Dam. "

Brussels ",UniCredit - A ticking bomb on climate mitigation,UniCredit ,Italy,,,,"
Environmental groups that attempt to prevent environmental devastation caused by the Šoštanj coal project in Slovenia,
 financed by the Italian UniCredit banking group, are taken aback when 
the bank announced its next in line PR exercise to promote its green 
credentials by endorsing the Natural Capital Declaration, in the run up to Rio+20.
UniCredit, one of the largest banking groups in the world, operates 
in 22 countries and holds the `largest investment banking operation in 
Central Eastern Europe` title. This bank has also been identified in the
 recent Bankrolling Climate Change report as one of the major investors in the coal industry. UniCredit 
takes its place on the Top 20 Coal Investing Banks` League Table and 
also as one of the highest ranking European bank that provide financing 
for the coal industry, coal plants, mines and utility companies.
UniCredit is one of the private banks that provide the 100 million euros loan for the development of the Šoštanj coal plant. This project alone will lock in tonnes of CO2 emission that potentially nils the bank`s good intensions when investing in German wind farms.
Lidija Živčič, senior expert at Focus, Slovenia said:
`UniCredit is investing millions of euros of its account holders` money in the Šoštanj coal plant in Slovenia that will devastate our environment, drive 
climate change, and impact the health of the local population for the 
next four decades. UniCredit claims to `have engaged in a number of initiatives aiming at reducing direct and indirect impacts of `their` operations` - investing in Šoštanj coal project is clearly not one of those initiatives and we hence call the bank to withdraw from this project immediately.`
UniCredit is a ticking bomb on the environment and the European 
economy. The bank was recently brought to its knees by the global 
economic turmoil and by its own unsustainable investment behaviour.
UniCredit is also a major investor in the coal industry; in the past 
five years the bank provided millions of Euros for Enel, the Italian 
utility company that pushes the renaissance of coal in Europe.
The bank is facing an increased and unified opposition from local 
communities, the general public and civil society. UniCredit proved so 
far nothing of its green credential but to be an obstacle in the fight 
to tackle climate change.
Its latest move to endorse the Natural Capital Declaration in the run
 up to `Rio +20` is seen as mere PR exercise to shield against growing 
opposition against the bank`s irresponsible and environmentally 
unsustainable operational and investment manoeuvres.

Nijmegen ","“Nuclear Banks, No Thanks!” coalition welcomes cancellation Belene nuclear plant",BNP Paribas ,France,Belene nuclear power plant ,energy plants - nuclear,Bulgaria,"
Yesterday, the Bulgarian government officially announced the cancellation of the Belene nuclear power project. BankTrack and other members of the “Nuclear Banks, No Thanks!” coalition applauds this decision after years of uncertainty around the project.
Jan Haverkamp, nuclear expert consultant for Greenpeace, comments : “We are extremely happy that Bulgaria finally pulled the plug from the Belene nuclear power project. The power station was to be built in a seismic active zone, where in 1977 120 people lost their lives in an earthquake only 14 km from the planned site, in the town of Svishtov. Finally, the Bulgarian government has seen that the facts on safety, high costs and energy dependency from Russia cannot be ignored. This is a great day for all that kept the debate and opposition alive over the 25 years it took from the first ideas to the final out.""
The project was already canceled once in 1992, after fierce local opposition on environmental grounds and an economic downturn after the fall of communism. When in 2002 plans were revived to construct Belene this again sparked strong local opposition. The situation became especially tense in 2004 when local organic farmer and Greenpeace activist Albena Simeonova received death threats after Greenpeace joined court proceedings against the flawed Environmental Impact Assessment.
Heffa Schücking, from the German NGO urgewald, continues: “The opposition to Belene went international from 2006 onwards when Western potential investors and financiers were approached. We had to fight against RWE as 49% strategic investor, who quit the project in 2009, as well as the involvement of French bank BNP Paribas, which finally withdrew its involvement in 2010. Other banks and utilities we had to pressure to stay out of the project included Deutsche Bank, UniCredit, Citi, E.ON, Electrabel and recently HSBC that acted as advisor to the Bulgarian government. Today is really a huge success and a great achievement for Bulgarian and international civil society.”
Yann Louvel, climate and energy campaign coordinator for the BankTrack network, concludes: “The official cancellation of the Belene nuclear power plant project sends a clear signal to banks that, after the Fukushima nuclear catastrophe, the nuclear industry is a dying business, It has never been more risky to fund nuclear plants, both financially and in terms of reputational risk with customers. Banks need to draw a clear lesson and stop funding nuclear and invest instead in the future, in energy efficiency and renewables. They need to immediately abandon the worst nuclear dodgy deals around the world, such as Mochovce (Slovakia), Temelin (Czech Republic), Angra 3 (Brazil) and Jaitapur (India). As with Belene, we will continue to confront them until this happens.”

Nijmegen ",Equator Principles III better be good,,,,,,"

The Equator Principles Association (Association) this week announced a
new delay in the release of the third version of the Equator Principles
(EPIII).
In a brief statement, the Association stated that it is “continuing
internal discussions with its members on the first draft of EP III and as a
result the overall timeline for the EP III Update process has been extended
again” The release of EPIII is now foreseen for October 2012, but “The timeline
might be subject to further extension if deemed necessary” (1)
Despite assurances from the association that it  “will aim to be open and transparent during
the EP III Update process” and “ welcome feedback and comments from any
interested party on both process and substance” until now no draft document of
the Principles has ever been shared with civil society stakeholders.
If EPIII is indeed launched end of October 2012 it will have taken the
Association a staggering two full years since the start of the strategic review
process (2) to revise a six page document that provides adopting banks with ‘a
credit risk management framework for determining, assessing and managing
environmental and social risk in project finance transactions’.
The fact that it takes Association members an additional 6 months
(compared to original schedule) to reach an agreement on the draft text fuels
fears that little can still be changed once that text is released for the 60
day Stakeholder Consultation and Public Comment Process.
It better be good!
According to BankTrack, the review process need not take that long, but
if it does the outcome better be good. 
At our meeting in October 2011 in Washington
 DC we provided the Association
with a detailed list of issues that need to be adequately dealt with in the new
EPIII if the Principles are to remain relevant for banks seeking a sustainable
way forward with their business operations. (3)
The paper ’The Outside Job’ seeks commitments from the Association on:
Transparency: EPIII can only deliver if affected communities have
full and timely access to all relevant documents and information about the
project, including information on which banks are financing the project, and if
the proper implementation of EPs on project level can be independently verified
by external stakeholders
Accountability: banks adopting EPIII must commit to publicly report
on their implementation of the principles on project level and allow themselves
to be challenged on this through appropriate channels.
Scope
extension: EPIII must be a risk management
tool not only for project finance transactions but for the financing of all
projects, including corporate loans and other financing arrangements.
Climate
change: a risk management tool that
does not contain credible commitments to stop financing projects that massively
contribute to climate change, being the biggest risk faced by everyone on the
planet, banks included, is not worth its name; next to obligations to project
sponsors to identify less GHG alternatives for all proposed projects, we expect
a categorical exclusion of the financing of climate destructive projects as
coal mining, coal power plants and oil exploration projects –especially tar
sand operations-. The risks posed by these projects cannot be mitigated.
Human
rights: EPIII must ensure that
adopting banks comply with their obligations to respect human rights, as
outlined in the ‘Protect, Respect and Remedy’ framework, and ensure that
arrangements are in place to respect human rights on project level. EPIII must
require proper human rights due diligence procedures for banks and conduct of
human rights impact assessments by sponsors where necessary.
Johan Frijns, Director of BankTrack commented “After two years of
deliberations, expectations on the outcome of the update process have soared;
the new Equator Principles must be a major step forward on all the issues
listed in our ‘Outside Job’ paper. If EPIII closely resembles EPII the
Association may as well dissolve itself as yet another toothless debating club”

Madrid, Spain ",Banco Santander ranked second in the Spanish armed banking,Banco Santander ,Spain,,,,"

Delàs Center of Peace Studies, Observatorio de la Deuda en la
Globalización (ODG-Debtwatch) and SETEM, united
for the campaign ""Banco Santander without weapons"", reveal that Banco
Santander is the second Spanish bank contributing to the arms industry.
Next Friday the 30th, in Santander (Cantabria), SETEM, Centre Delàs
of Peace and Justice Studies and ODG, members of the campaign ""Banco
Santander without weapons"", will denounce the Board of Shareholders of the
Banco Santander for being the second
Spanish financial institution with largest investments in the arms industry,
and because the Banco Santander's corporate policy on human rights and social
responsibilities are incoherent with its actual activities.
The entities promoting the campaign ""Banco Santader without weapons""
and ""Banca Limpia"" will take part for the fourth year in the General
Assembly of Shareholders of Banco Santander thanks to their 222,989 delegated shares, and will prove before the Banco Santander Board of Directors and
their shareholders the relationship
between the Spanish bank and the production and selling of arms around the
world, such as warships, bombs, rockets, torpedoes, missiles, fuel and
military explosives.
This year, ""Banco Santander without weapons"" has reported that Banco Santander has
contributed with more than 1,000 million€ over the last ten years to the
production and selling of arms. Thus, Mr. Emilio Botín will be given the
(dis)Honour Diploma for being the President of the second financial institution
in the rank of the Spanish armed banks.
Despite the dialogue set by ""Santander without wapons"" and ""Banca
Limpia"" towards the Banco Santander, its internal policy of finances is
clearly insufficient since it merely restricts the arms already forbidden by
the existing legislation (related to nuclear weapons, cluster bombs and
depleted uranium weapons), without
forbidding other arms directly responsible of human rights' violations and of
millions of deaths caused by armed conflicts and wars around the world.
A representative of the MAB (Movimiento de
afectados por las represas de Brasil) will report the human rights'
violations and the severe social and environmental impacts caused by the
intervention of Banco Santander in one of the countries with richest
biodiversity, and territory of the indigenous peoples, in the middle of
Amazonia, through financing the dam of Santo Antonio, despite the fact the Permanent
Peoples' Tribunal condemned this project it and that, since 2008, Setem has
called for the Bank to withdraw this tragic investment.
These facts, revealed today by the ""Banco Santander without weapons""
campaign, prove the great incoherence of this bank regarding the corporative
policy on human rights and environment, as well as regarding the voluntary
proposals of Corporative Social Responsibility this bank is attached to,
confronted with the actual practices.
The three entities have recently launched the website www.bancaarmada.org  where
the relation between Banco Santander and many other Spanish financial
institutions with the arms industry and other controversial sectors has been
condemned. This website also includes the ranking of the armed banks in
Spain. "

Nijmegen ",BankTrack welcomes withdrawal Bank Austria from Mochovce Nuclear power plant,UniCredit ,Italy,Mochovce nuclear power plant (units 3 & 4) ,energy plants - nuclear,Slovakia,"
Bank Austria, the Austrian subsidiary of the Italian UniCredit banking group, has confirmed that by mutual agreement it will terminate a financial facility granted to Slovenske Elektrarne (SE). SE will be the operator of the Mochovce nuclear reactors 3 & 4, currently under construction. The confirmation came after enquiries by Global 2000 (Friends of the Earth Austria) and Greenpeace.
""Slovenske Elektrarne has boasted in public presentations that the credit provided by private banks for its ongoing operations in fact indirectly enabled the building of the scrap nuclear reactors at Mochovce,"" said Patricia Lorenz, nuclear campaigner for Global 2000. “This is in direct contradiction with assurances made by Bank Austria earlier on the use of their credit.”
In a related development Mochovce NPP operator ENEL/SE also announced last week that the two nuclear units 3 and 4 will be completed one year later than previously planned. The construction of block 3 will now be completed by the end of 2013, and unit 4 not before the middle of 2014. 
""We have warned the management of Bank Austria against this risky business for months and are pleased that our negotiations have now led to some results with the bank. The completion of Mochovce 3 and 4 is again pushed a bit further away,"" said Niklas Schinerl, nuclear expert for Greenpeace Austria. He added : ""We hope we can still convince Slovenske Elektrarne to stop further construction of this dangerous nuclear power plant"".
The reactors planned for Mochovce 3 & 4 are Soviet-type VVER 440 2nd generation reactors, which are designed without a full containment building and cannot be upgraded. As such there is a higher probability of severe accidents and the release of radioactivity. The construction of the two reactors has been vigorously opposed since the inception of the project in the 1980s.
""The credit freeze and construction delay are new hurdles for SE and signal a victory in the fight against the building of these reactors"" said Yann Louvel, climate and energy campaign coordinator for BankTrack. ""As all banks financing SE know, money is fungible. They should do the same as Bank Austria and close down their credit lines with Slovenske Elektrarne to prevent the completion of Mochovce 3 and 4"".

",Heritage before Hydropower: Petition to UNESCO on Ilisu Dam launched,,,Ilisu dam ,energy plants - dams,Turkey,"

(Zurich, Berlin, Vienna - 14.3.2012) On the
occasion of today's International Day of Action for Rivers an
international coalition of environmental and human rights organisations
launches a petition to UNESCO to become active in protecting potential World
Heritage Sites which are under threat due to the construction of the Ilisu Dam
in Turkey. For the first time initiatives from Turkey, Iraq and Iran engage
jointly in the protection of their natural and cultural heritage. 
The transnational alliance speaks out against the
destruction of the 10,000 year old town Hasankeyf, which would be flooded in
the Ilisu Dam's reservoir, and against the severe impacts on the Mesopotamian
Marshes and its inhabitants at the mouth of the Tigris river. They are
supported by numerous organisations throughout the world, including Swiss Berne
Declaration, CounterCurrent from Germany and ECA Watch Austria which have
campaigned on the Ilisu project for over a decade.
Hasankeyf and the Tigris valley are a unique natural
and cultural landscape. They form the livelihood for thousands of inhabitants.
Even though Hasankeyf is under monumental protection by Turkish law, the
Turkish government intends its inundation.
The Mesopotamian Marshes were included in the Tentative
List of potential World Heritage Sites by the Iraqi government in 2003. The
actual nomination process to become a UNESCO World Heritage Site has not been
initiated however. Ulrich Eichelmann from ECA Watch Austria has recently
visited the marshes. He confirms: ""The impacts of the Ilisu Dam for the
Mesopotamian Marshes would be devastating. If Ilisu is actually built, the
garden of Eden will dry up and hundreds of thousands Iraqi people will suffer.""
""Dams violate human rights, destroy nature
and cultural goods and are not even climate friendly in many cases"", Heike
Drillisch, coordinator of CounterCurrent, states. These points of criticism are
currently being addressed at the Alternative World Water Forum in Marseille.
This event is organized to demonstrate against privatisation schemes and the
destructive impacts of dams which are promoted at the World Water Forum taking
place at the same time in Marseille. The petition to UNESCO is presented at the
Alternative World Water Forum.

Brazil ",ILO Says Brazil Violated Convention 169 in Belo Monte Case,,,Belo Monte dam ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"
A report released by the Committee of Experts on the Application of
Conventions and Recommendations for the International Labor Organization (ILO)
found the Brazilian government directly violated the rights of indigenous
communities in the Xingu region of the Amazon while plowing forward with the
controversial Belo Monte Dam project. The report shows that by failing to
conduct indigenous hearings in villages impacted by the Belo Monte Dam prior to
approving the project's construction, Brazil violated Convention 169 which
guarantees indigenous peoples the right to free, prior and informed
consultation over projects that affect their lands and rights.
According to the ILO document, ""the Commission notes that, under Article
15 of the Convention, the government is obliged to consult indigenous peoples
before undertaking or permitting any programs for the exploitation of existing
resources on their lands,"" going on to state that Belo Monte would change
the navigability of the Xingu, while irrevocably impacting the fauna, flora and
climate of the region. These impacts, the ILO said, ""go beyond the
flooding of land or displacement of these people.""
""This is yet another major blow to the international legal and reputational
standing of the Brazilian government as it recklessly pursues the construction
of the Belo Monte Dam to the detriment of indigenous and traditional peoples of
the Xingu,"" said Christian Poirier, Brazil Program Director at Amazon
Watch. ""While the Rousseff government seems impervious to all reason
surrounding this project, the world continues to call her to task.""
The findings of the ILO confirm the position of Brazil's Federal Public
Ministry (MPF) and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights of the
Organization of American States, two institutions that have condemned the
Brazilian government for failure to hold indigenous hearings and have demanded
the project's suspension.
The findings also invalidate the ruling of Brazil's Federal Circuit  Court TRF1 that held
that indigenous hearings could occur at any time, even after their communities
have suffered Belo Monte's irreversible impacts. Contradicting the TRF1, the
Commission states that ""according to the documentation and information
submitted by the government, the procedures carried out so far...do not meet
the requirements set out in Articles 6 and 15 of the Convention, nor do they
demonstrate that indigenous peoples were allowed to participate effectively in determining
their priorities in accordance with Article 7 of the Convention."" The
legal case against Belo Monte is expected to reach Brazil's Supreme Court.
In final recommendations the ILO's Committee of Experts asks the Brazilian
government to:

Take the necessary measures to carry out consultations with the affected indigenous communities, in accordance with Articles 6 and15 of the Convention on the construction of the Belo Monte Dam, before the possible harmful effects of that plant are irreversible.
In consultation with indigenous peoples, take steps to determine whether the priorities of these peoples were respected and their interests will be adversely affected and to what
extent, in order to adopt appropriate
mitigation and compensation.
Inform the Federal Court of Pará about the results of the procedure.

More on ILO Convention 169:
The Convention Concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples - 169 Convention -
was ratified by Brazil in 2002 and enacted through a presidential decree in
2004. Convention 169 establishes, among other things, that indigenous and
tribal peoples have the right to be consulted in a free, prior and informed
manner about state actions that may affect their property or rights. "

Washington ",Don’t bank on the bomb,Banco Santander ,Spain,,,,"
A groundbreaking report released today by
ICAN identifies more than 300 banks, pension funds, insurance companies and
asset managers in 30 countries with substantial investments in nuclear arms
producers. View the report at www.dontbankonthebomb.com.
The 180-page study, Don't Bank on the
Bomb, provides details of financial transactions with 20 companies that are
heavily involved in the manufacture, maintenance and modernization of US,
British, French and Indian nuclear forces.
Divesting from Nuclear Weapons
We need your help to put pressure on
financial institutions to stop investing in the nuclear arms industry. By
financing nuclear weapons producers, banks and other institutions are in effect
facilitating the build-up of nuclear forces. ICAN supporter and Nobel Peace
Prize winner Desmond Tutu has called on financial institutions to ""do the
right thing and assist, rather than impede, efforts to eliminate the threat of
radioactive incineration"", noting that divestment was a vital part of the
successful campaign to end apartheid in South Africa.
""Today, the same tactic can - and
must - be employed to challenge man's most evil creation: the nuclear bomb. No
one should be profiting from this terrible industry of death, which threatens
us all,"" he wrote.
Who's Involved?
Nuclear-armed nations spend in excess of
US$100 billion each year maintaining and modernizing their nuclear forces, with
much of this work being carried out by corporations such as BAE Systems in the
United Kingdom, Lockheed Martin in the United States, Thales in France and
Larsen & Toubro in India.
Financial institutions invest in these
companies by providing loans and purchasing shares and bonds. Of the 322
financial institutions identified in the report, roughly half are based in the
United States and a third in Europe. Asian, Australian and Middle Eastern
institutions are also listed.
Those most heavily involved in financing
nuclear arms makers include Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase in the United
States; BNP Paribas in France; Deutsche Bank in Germany; Mistubishi UJF
Financial in Japan; Banco Santander in Spain; Credit Suisse and UBS in
Switzerland; and Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland in Britain.
The Case for Divestment
The report emphasizes the humanitarian,
legal and environmental arguments for divestment. Setsuko Thurlow, a survivor
of the US atomic bombing of Hiroshima in 1945, writes in the report:
""Anyone with a bank account or pension fund has the power to choose to
invest his or her money ethically - in a way that does not contribute to this
earth-endangering enterprise.""
In addition to stating the ethical case
for divestment, the report also warns of the reputational risks associated with
financing nuclear arms, and highlights the positive role that financial
institutions could play in the quest for nuclear-weapon-free world. "

Argentina ",US Export-Import Bank (Exim) and EDC of Canada will not finance Barrick’s Pascua Lama Gold Mining Project,,,Pascua Lama gold mining project ,mining - non coal,Argentina,"

US Export-Import Bank (Exim) and Export Development Canada (EDC), two of
the world's largest publicly funded development finance institutions, will not
be contributing to the highly controversial Pascua Lama gold mining project
straddling the border between Argentina and Chile. The
project has already and will further destroy glaciers to get at
gold mineral deposits if it gets underway, affecting the water supply for
indigenous communities and small agriculture in Chile as well as an
internationally protected biosphere reserve in Argentina.
Exim Bank which lists Category
A projects under consideration notes the Pascua Lama project as ""Withdrawn"". A spokesperson from Exim bank indicated that
Barrick has simply decided to take its business elsewhere. EDC never published
the project because Pascua Lama never made it past preliminary due diligence
review. EDC has also confirmed that Barrick has decided
to seek financing elsewhere.
Pascua Lama has drawn strong
opposition from thousands of local residents, NGOs, environmental activists,
indigenous groups and even government agencies which have spoken strongly
against the project. Both Exim and EDC's due diligence reviews were bogged down
with long lines of stakeholders wanting to express their concerns and offer
information to the banks regarding the present and expected social and
environmental impacts to be felt by the mega gold mine, the first bi-national
mining venture of its kind.
In November of 2011, the Center for Human Rights and Environment (CEDHA)
filed an Equator
Principles Due Diligence Review of Pascua Lama to Exim and to EDC, laying out in 45 pages of
detail, the clear violations to the Equator Principles of the Pascua Lama
Project should either bank move forward with financing. The report centered on
glacier impacts, indigenous community impacts, mountain highland impacts, and
several other social and environmental dimensions which would be irreversibly
affected by the Pascua Lama project. CEDHA as well as several co-sponsors to
the complaint (including the International Accountability Project, Banktrack,
FuCI and Inti Chuteh, called on the banks to reject Barrick's request for
financing the controversial bi-national gold mine. It is estimated that
eventual loans to Barrick could have been in the order of hundreds of millions
of dollars.
Other groups organized across the Andes, particularly inChile, but
streaming up to North America, and around the world, sending letters and
requests to both EDC and Exim to drop Barrick from any financing
consideration. Argentina's National Park Services also expressed concerns
over Barrick's impacts to local water streams that could affect the
internationally protected San Guillermo Biosphere Reserve. The project is also
in conflict, argues CEDHA, withArgentina's recently enacted Glacier Protection
Law. Barrick has attacked the law in federal courts, seeking an injunction to
suspend the law in the Argentine province of San Juan, where
Pascua Lama is set to implement.
Among the evidence presented to the banks was Barrick's original hard-to-believe Glacier
Management Plan, which essentially proposed to dynamite glaciers that were in the way of
the gold reserves and haul the ice off in dump trucks to avoid, as Barrick put
it incredulously, environmental hazards that might occur due to collapsing ice
at the mine site!
Barrick probably thought, that the rapidly mounting opposition to eventual
EDC and Exim bank loans, would lead to a rejection by the banks. Both EDC and
Exim have to respect global social and environmental standards they adhere to
under the Equator
Principles. Barrick's request was already delayed for over a year, as the due
diligence processes dragged on addressing local social and environmental
concerns. An EDC or Exim bank rejection of Barrick's loan application would
have driven up financial costs for Barrick and they'd have to turn to other
private banks, under more risky investment circumstances. Barrick's decision to
withdraw their financing request to EDC and Exim bank is likely to be due to
Barrick deciding to cut losses short before the risks of further conflict
further raises financial costs.

",Thailand Defies Neighbors on Contentious Xayaburi Dam,,,Xayaburi dam ,energy plants - dams,Laos,"
Bangkok, Thailand - As the governments of the Mekong region continue to deliberate on the proposed Xayaburi Dam in Laos, the Thai government has defied the regional decision-making process and pushed ahead with the project's implementation. Recent oversight hearings by the Thai Senate and the National Human Rights Commission confirm that the government has joined Laos in concluding that the regional process is complete, thereby allowing Thai developer Ch. Karnchang to proceed with construction.
""The Thai government has ignored the agreements made last year amongst the four regional governments and the concerns expressed by Cambodia and Vietnam. With more than eight provinces in Thailand at risk from the Xayaburi Dam's transboundary impacts, the state has also disregarded its duty to protect its own people from harm. It's irresponsible to push forward with this dam, when the project's impacts on Thailand have yet to be adequately studied,"" said Pianporn Deetes, Thailand Campaign Coordinator for International Rivers.
An investigation by International Rivers last week revealed that preliminary construction on the Xayaburi Dam is continuing, despite the agreement by the governments of Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam in December 2011 to pursue further study of the impacts of hydropower on the Mekong River before deciding whether to build the project.  A large number of workers have been employed for a two year period to construct access roads and facilities for the project.
In a letter dated 30 January 2012, the Thai Minister of Energy Arak Cholthanon informed the Senate Committee on Corruption Investigation and Good Governance Promotion that ""the Ministry of Natural Resources confirms that the Prior Consultation process has completed.""  Minister Cholthanon further stated that ""EGAT  and the Xayaburi project developer have signed the PPA  on 29 October 2011.""
Thailand has not disclosed the power purchase agreement to the public.
""The Mekong River Commission governments have not yet reached agreement on the Xayaburi Dam nor have they closed the prior consultation process,"" said Ms. Lam Thi Thu Suu, Director of the Centre for Social Research and Development in Vietnam. ""By committing to purchase power from the dam and moving forward with the project's implementation, EGAT and Ch. Karnchang are violating the trust and goodwill of Thailand's neighbors. No construction on the Xayaburi Dam should proceed while further study is underway.""
On 21 February 2012, the National Human Rights Commission of Thailand organized a public hearing on the Xayaburi Dam after receiving a complaint from Thai communities in eight provinces. Several Thai government officials testified about their involvement in the project, including representatives from EGAT, the Ministry of Energy, and the Energy Regulatory Commission. Five Thai companies also testified about their involvement, including Thai project developer Ch. Karnchang and investors from Krung Thai Bank, Bangkok Bank, Kasikorn Bank, and Siam Commercial Bank.
The hearing confirmed that the four Thai banks have already provided financial support for the Xayaburi Dam. In a resolution on 15 November 2011, the Thai Cabinet granted permission to state-owned Krung Thai Bank to invest in the project. When the Commission asked about the steps they took to examine the project's environmental and social impacts, however, the banks were not able to provide detailed information.
""It's astonishing to think that the financiers of this project have not taken the dam's significant environmental and social impacts more seriously. Even a five minute search on the internet would reveal numerous media reports that highlight the concerns of the Thai people,"" said Ms Deetes. ""The recklessness of EGAT's and the Thai companies' pursuit of the project is likely to become a catastrophe for our country's reputation. We call on the Thai government to immediately cancel the power purchase agreement and for Thai banks to withdraw financing from the Xayaburi Dam.""
Although the Xayaburi Dam site is located in Laos, Thailand is building and financing the project. The Thai government plans to purchase 95% of the electricity, although an independent study has already concluded that the Xayaburi Dam's electricity is not needed to meet Thailand's demand for energy in the coming decades.

USA ",New investor brief exposes China National Petroleum Corporation’s lack of mechanism for addressing environmental and social risks,,,,,,"
Friends of the Earth today released Crude beginnings, a new investor brief  on the environmental and social risks associated with China National Petroleum Corporation, one of the world's biggest oil companies.CNPC, China's leading oil and gas producer and supplier, is rapidly increasing its global footprint, and operates in dozens of countries around the world. The report, Crude beginnings, is among the first to assess the company's overseas environmental and social risks, as well as the company's ability to manage those risks. It is being released at a briefing today for institutional investors, who own part of CNPC via its publicly traded subsidiaries PetroChina (NYSE: PTR) and Kunling Energy (HK: 00135).""As Chinese companies become more active globally, investors and the international community are keenly interested in ensuring that companies like CNPC abide by internationally accepted norms to protect people and the planet,"" said Michelle Chan, Economic policy program director for Friends of the Earth.Friends of the Earth has long tracked the world's largest oil companies, from Exxon to BP to Shell. The report found that like most international oil majors, CNPC faces political, social and environmental risks, including impacts on communities and indigenous peoples, operations in biodiversity hotspots, and exposure to violent conflict and corruption.""Despite the company's size and reach, CNPC does not yet have comparable adequate environmental and social governance systems to effectively address these risks,"" said Chan, contrasting CNPC with its international peers. ""This can harm communities and the environment, undermine the company's operational effectiveness and erode long-term shareholder value."" The study, which is drawn from interviews with company representatives, academics and others, finds that the company's underdeveloped corporate strategy regarding overseas environmental and social issues does not reflect international best practices, nor does it provide fundamental safeguards for society, workers and the environment. The report also examines five case studies of company operations in Peru, Sudan, Iraq, Myanmar (Burma), Kazakhstan and Russia, which provide both positive and negative examples of the company's environmental and social performance abroad.Finally, the report notes that many external actors could potentially influence the company, including Chinese government ministries, intergovernmental bodies and investors, but that they all so far have had limited impact on the company's environmental and social performance overseas.""CNPC does not seem to have a clear corporate strategy for managing environmental and social risks abroad,"" said Chan. ""But its subsidiaries, which are on the front lines confronting these risks, may hold the most short-term promise for driving improvements to the company's overseas performance.""""Friends of the Earth's report Crude beginnings:  An assessment of China National Petroleum Corporation's environmental and social performance abroad is an excellent roadmap, if CNPC chooses to use it, to assuring that the corporation's actions and governance meet fast-developing expectations regarding the sustainable operation of multinational firms,"" said Julie Gorte, Senior Vice President for Sustainable Investing at PaxWorld Management LLC. ""As China's role as a major multinational economic player increases, investors, stakeholders and civil society will all expect Chinese corporations to step up to the sustainability plate, and as one of the world's largest energy companies, CNPC can help to lead the way. Friends of the Earth has outlined many positive concrete steps that CNPC - or really any oil company, or any Chinese company, may wish to consider quite seriously."" "

Davos, Switzerland ","If you want your reputation to go downhill, invest in “Northern Caucasus  Resorts”",,,,,,"
At this year's World Economic Forum in Davos, which closed its doors yesterday, one of the hot debates was that capitalism, in its current form, no longer fits the world around us. An obvious example of  capitalism going in the wrong direction is the project plan of the Russian state company OJSC ""Northern Caucasus Resorts"" to turn the Northern Caucasus Region into a $15 billion tourism cluster area, covered by a network of high-end mountain ski resorts.The quest for European and Asian investors was kicked-off with a presentation event a year ago in Davos, and still is in full swing.The five new mountain ski resorts, with a total area of 2,500 km, are to be located in six Republics of the Northern Caucasus, a region of high ecological value, but also affected by many strains and conflicts. The leaked project plans of four out of the five new ski resorts illustrate that the project perimeters overlap with the ""Western Caucasus"" UNESCO World Natural Heritage territory, four nature reserves and two national parks, where ""constructions"" of any tourist infrastructures is illegal or strictly limited according to Russian federal nature protection legislation.In order to legalize the dodgy plans of OJSC ""Northern Caucasus  Resorts"", the Russian government has started a process of overruling and undermining existing federal regulations on nature protection. This will have a huge negative impact on more than forty nature reserves and protected areas all over the vast territory of Russia.This is yet another sad case of how the present Russian government, ruled by bad governance, is willing to take big steps back regarding nature protection as well as environmental and social justice, for the sake of ""fast-tracking"" economic development which is only beneficial to a small elite.Ahead of any other foreign investors, Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations (CDC), a French state-owned group and long-term investor that is supposed to be serving the public interest and the goal of sustainable development, signed an agreement for the creation of a joint venture ""France-Caucase"" with OJSC ""Northern Caucasus Resorts"". The objective is to funnel advanced French technical, legal, planning and environmental expertise as well as direct investment for the creation of a ski lift, hotel, airport, mountain tunnel and other construction projects (from a wide range of French companies.).However, CDC and other foreign investors are risking becoming accomplices to a huge-scale unsustainable project, in violation of Russian federal environmental law and international law (Convention for the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage), and would also be non-compliance with their own sustainability policies as well as International Sustainable Finance Standards, e.g. UN Principles for Responsible Investment.Greenpeace and other NGOs are by no means against tourism development in the Caucasus, we welcome a truly socially and ecologically sustainable tourism. However, sustainability requires that none of the existing protection areas and none of Russia's existing nature protection laws will be narrowed in any possible way. This region does offer opportunities for tourism development without creating social injustice and environmental damage to unique nature sites of global importance.We call upon all investors to either ensure no undermining of Russian national nature protection legislation, no changes to existing nature protection area borders, no construction of tourism buildings or other infrastructure inside protected areas, core zones of national parks and territory of the ""Western Caucasus"" UNESCO World Natural Heritage - or to disinvest.

",Troops deployed to guard China pipeline,,,Shwe gas and pipelines projects ,oil and gas,Myanmar,"
January 27, Democratic Voice of BurmaTroops deployed to guard China pipelineBurmese soldiers have been withdrawn from conflict zones in Kachin state as both sides push for ceasefire talks, but reports from nearby Shan state suggest extra battalions have been deployed to guard the lucrative China-backed Shwe pipeline.The movement of troops has taken place in the wake of recent talks between government officials and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) in the Chinese border town of Ruili. The negotiations ended on 19 January with both sides failing to secure an agreement.La Nan, spokesperson of the KIA, said the withdrawal of Burmese troops from areas around Mansi in Kachin state and Mongtong in Shan state had been expected. “They’ve been in these regions for about a year but they were always going to go back,” he said, adding that other divisions still remained.But reports in the Thailand-based Kachin News Group suggest it may have been a redeployment rather than withdrawal – up to 1,500 troops are en route to northern Shan state close to where the KIA’s 8th Battalion is stationed. That region, which encompasses the towns of Namtu and Nam Kham, is where the oil and gas pipelines will pass through on route to China’s southern Yunnan Province.In Muse, across the border from Ruili, the news group cited eye-witnesses who had seen “a convoy of more than 30 transport trucks carrying troops and supplies” from Kachin state. They bore the insignia of the Burmese army’s 99th Division, the same one that withdrew from Kachin state earlier this week.The Shwe pipeline project is the centrepiece of China’s booming investment programme for Burma, particularly following Naypyidaw’s decision to scrap the Myitsone Dam, a move that triggered anger and bewilderment in Beijing. The pipeline will account for around six percent of China’s total energy needs, much of which will be focused on Yunnan, whose development has lagged behind the rest of the country.Despite various attempts at negotiating an end to conflict with the KIA, which broke out in June last year, ending a 17-year ceasefire, fighting continues. The KNG reported that a bloody clash erupted on 20 January, also in northern Shan state.Further south in the state, the army has begun withdrawing its soldiers from territory close to Wanhai, which is controlled by the Shan State Army-North (SSA-N). The group agreed to an initial truce earlier this month during talks in Naypyidaw, and will meet again with government officials on 28 January.Additional reporting by Aye Nai "

Vientiane, Laos ",Xayaburi Dam: What Next?,,,Xayaburi dam ,energy plants - dams,Laos,"
On December 8th, we watched the future of the Mekong River hang by the threads of a single meeting. Government ministers from Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam met to decide whether to approve Laos' controversial Xayaburi Dam, the first of 12 large dams across the Mainstream Mekong River. Scientists warn that the dams would decimate the Mekong River's fish population and threaten the food security of more than 2 million people, but the projects have crept forward nonetheless.
After hours of deliberation, the four governments issued a vaguely worded statement calling for ""further study on the sustainable development and management of the Mekong River."" As the Bangkok Post observed, the statement ""made no mention about the much disputed dam project in Laos, not even a single word.""
One month later, it seems that the four governments are still discussing what ""further study"" means. The governments may seek the assistance of Japan and other international donors in the study, but this is still being negotiated. A number of fundamental questions remain unanswered:What does this mean for the Xayaburi Dam?
Laos has not clarified if construction on the Xayaburi Dam will stop while the study takes place. Legally, Laos may not proceed with construction until all four governments have agreed. Practically, allowing construction would undermine the study. In 2011, the Mekong River Commission completed a technical review of the proposed Xayaburi Dam and found that ""fisheries would potentially be heavily impacted during the construction phase."" Scientists cannot accurately study the impacts of the dams on the Mekong River if construction activities are underway - the baseline data on the river's previous conditions would have already disappeared.What will be studied?
Scientists widely recognize that not enough is known about the Mekong River to fully understand the damage that the dams could bring. The most important study so far is a 2010 strategic environmental assessment, prepared for the Mekong River Commission, which identifies over 50 scientific unknowns that prevent an informed decision about the dams (see Annex IV, p. 159). This authoritative list provides an obvious outline for ""further study.""
The study should also incorporate a number of public consultations, so that the local communities who would be affected by the projects can explain the ways that they depend on the river. In this way, the study would be seen as a more legitimate basis for decision-making.How long will the study take?
The 2010 strategic environmental assessment recommends setting aside 10 years for further study. Vietnam has supported this recommendation, and even the Lao government has acknowledged that this timeframe would be necessary. With so much at stake, it's better for the four governments to think in terms of one decade instead of one year:

 Large area to cover: The Mekong River Basin covers around 86% of Cambodia, 97% of Laos, 36% of Thailand, and 20% of Vietnam.


 Huge number of impacted people: An estimated 60 million people living in the Mekong River Basin could be affected, and the food security of at least 2 million people will be directly threatened by the decision.


 Numerous gaps in knowledge: Many of the 50 recommended scientific studies will need to be multi-year efforts to track river conditions over time. For example, scientists still have not studied the migratory patterns of most of the Mekong's hundreds of fish species, and do not have a good sense of the different ways that people rely on the river for their livelihoods.

The upcoming study presents an important opportunity, but its success depends on the way the study is designed and carried out. A comprehensive, 10-year study is needed before the governments should consider the Xayaburi Dam or any more proposals for Mekong mainstream dams. While the December meeting was a step forward, the toughest decisions still lie ahead. "

Washington, DC ",President Obama rejects the Keystone XL pipeline,,,Canadian tar sands ,oil and gas,Canada,"
Administration deals a blow to Big Oil and its cronies in Congress, takes a stand for Americans' health and livelihoods, and a safe climate
Today, the Obama administration rejected the permit for the Keystone 
XL tar sands oil pipeline sought by Canadian oil firm TransCanada, 
determining that the project was not in the national interest.
""President Obama has shown bold leadership in standing up to Big Oil 
and rejecting the Keystone XL pipeline,"" said Erich Pica, president of 
Friends of the Earth. ""The climate movement took on Goliath and won, 
demonstrating its growing strength. Sustained grassroots pressure aimed 
at holding the president accountable to the public interest proved more 
powerful than all the lobbyists and campaign cash the oil industry could
 muster.""
This iconic David versus Goliath victory was fueled by years of 
persistent grassroots campaigning to stop the project led by indigenous 
activists, environmentalists, farmers, ranchers and youth climate 
activists. Americans submitted more than 250,000 public comments against
 the proposal, several thousand more turned out in small-town Nebraska, 
in Texas and in Washington, D.C. to testify against the pipeline in 
public hearings -- and 1,253 people played a pivotal role in August by 
getting arrested during peaceful sit-ins on the president's doorstep.
Investigative efforts led by Friends of the Earth and allies exposed 
the State Department's review process as hopelessly corrupted by conflicts of interest and oil industry cronyism in advance of President Obama's call for a new review of the project in November.
""Today's announcement is a welcome example of President Obama 
following through on his promise that corporate polluter lobbyists will 
no longer set the agenda in Washington,"" said Pica. ""The Keystone XL 
pipeline would have been dirty at both ends, dangerous in between, and 
certainly not in our national interest. Big Oil and its 
bought-and-paid-for confederates in Congress couldn't drown this dirty 
reality despite all of their threats and bullying.""
""This defeat for Big Oil is a huge victory for the health and safety 
of Americans. It belongs to the indigenous communities who first sounded
 the alarm on the dangers of tar sands extraction, to the Nebraskan 
farmers and Texan ranchers who withstood TransCanada's bullying in the 
name of their land and livelihoods, to the activists from across the 
country who were arrested on the president's doorstep, and to all of us 
fighting for a safe climate and justice-fueled future,"" said Pica.
The Keystone XL pipeline would have pumped the world's dirtiest oil 
-- tar sands oil -- from Canada across America's heartland to Texas. The
 nation's top climate scientist, Dr. James Hansen, has said that fully 
exploiting the tar sands could destabilize the climate to the point of 
no return. Tar sands extraction is poisoning water downstream from the 
massive mining sites in Canada and tar sands refining would have 
increased air pollution that causes lung disease and other respiratory 
diseases in communities near refineries in Texas.
""Allowing expansion of the destructive tar sands oil industry is not 
and will never be in our nation's interest. We will remain vigilant to 
ensure that all of Big Oil's attempts to wring profits from the tar 
sands at the public's expense are defeated -- and that better, clean 
alternatives are deployed,"" said Pica.

Brussels ",New report: European banks fuelling food price volatility and hunger,Allianz ,Germany,,,,"
European banks, pension funds and insurance companies are increasing global hunger and poverty by speculating on  food prices and financing land grabs in poorer countries, according to a  new report released today (January 12) by Friends of the Earth Europe. The report analyses the activities of 29 European banks, pension funds and insurance companies, including Deutsche Bank, Barclays, RBS, Allianz, BNP Paribas, AXA, HSBC, Generali, Allianz, Unicredit and Credit Agricole. It reveals the significant involvement of these financial institutions in food speculation, and the direct or indirect financing of land grabbing. Environmental and development organisations are calling for strict regulation to rein in these destructive activities.Daniel Pentzlin, sustainable finance campaigner for Friends of the Earth Europe said: ""Food speculation and the financing of land grabbing leads to a catastrophic instability in global food prices - forcing millions of people into poverty and hunger. European banks, insurers and funds that speculate with food and land are gambling with peoples' lives whilst reaping huge profits. This industry needs strict regulation to protect the poorest in society.""The European Commission's proposed new rules for improving transparency in commodity derivatives markets  are a first step in the right direction, but serious omissions and loopholes need to be addressed.  ‘Farming Money' recommends a set of key measures to regulate European financial markets and tighten corporate policies on financial services and investments in food commodity derivatives and land deals.Daniel Pentzlin continued: ""2012 offers a big opportunity for Europe to  put a stop to the environmental and social damage done by financial  markets. Politicians need to step in and end excessive and harmful speculation.""Food speculation, with billions of Euros flooding in and out of financial products based on foodstuffs, causes price volatility. These rapid and unpredictable price swings hit the most vulnerable hardest, threatening their right to food, and making it more difficult for farmers to maintain an income - creating instability, hunger and poverty. Land-grabs, following direct and indirect investments in land by large European financial institutions, mean European companies are snatching up land, increasingly in Africa, at the expense of local livelihoods and food sovereignty, in addition to causing knock on environmental devastation through land-use change.Friends of the Earth Europe is calling on financial institutions to investigate, publish and reduce their involvement in food speculation and investments in land. Banks, pension funds and insurers should phase-out and refrain from speculating in financial products based on staple foods, which threatens the human right to food. European regulators should introduce caps on the size of bets speculators can make to curb excessive speculation.Read the full report ""Farming Money"" here. "

The Netherlands ",Dutch financial institutions speculate in food markets,,,,,,"

On the eve of Christmas, the Dutch TV program Zembla
broadcast the documentary Trade in Hunger, focusing on the activities of Dutch
financial institutions on the derivates market in staple foods such as corn,
grains, and sugar. This TV programme is based on the new SOMO report ‘Food
Markets in Dutch. Dutch banks and pension funds in agricultural derivatives
markets', published today, revealing the extent to which the largest Dutch
banks and pension funds are active on food derivatives markets. The recent
SOMO-study ‘Feeding the financial hype' demonstrates that academic studies have
found strong arguments for the fact that enlarged speculation on the
agricultural derivates markets contributed to increased price volatility,
leading to excessively increased food prices. This outcome negatively impacts
the poorest people in the world in particular, who spend up to 80 per cent of
their income on food.
The new
SOMO report examines the financial investments in the agricultural derivates
markets of the three largest Dutch banks, ABN AMRO, ING and Rabobank, as well
as the three largest asset managers of Dutch pension funds, APG, PGGM and
MnServices. The research covers 90 per cent of the Dutch bank market and 60 per
cent of the Dutch pension savings. With a total of 5 billion Euros, the pension
funds are the key players in the market. One of the first pension fund that became
active on this market globally, was PFZW and its asset manager PGGM. Today,
with 7 per cent of total assets invested in commodity derivatives it is one of
the most active pension funds in this field, compared to 2-3% for the other
Dutch pension included in the research. Of the banks, Rabobank (including
Robeco) has with a distance the biggest exposure in the field of agricultural
commodity derivatives markets. ABN AMRO is also an important actor,
specifically as a provider of clearing services, where with a market share of
around 10 per cent in the most important agricultural futures markets it
belongs to the global top 3. 
None of
the banks has any publicly stated corporate social responsibility (CSR) policy
with regard to these activities. The same is true for the pension funds, with
the exception of PFZW, which put a position paper on its website during the
course of this research.
Given
that the Dutch financial institutions reviewed all have corporate social
responsibility policies that include respect for Universal Human Rights,
including the right to affordable food . They should also play a role in
eliminating possible breaches of this right. Financial institutions active in
food derivatives markets should at a minimum provide their clients and the public
at large with a well-reasoned reply to the many reports that-based on recent
research by academics-have concluded that, taking the precautionary principle
into account, these investments should be curbed.  This means also that
they are fully transparent about the way they invest in commodity derivatives
markets.
However,
financial investors could do more than just (try to) better explain what they
are doing and why. Following the precautionary principle also private financial
institutions could take steps, given the gravity of the issue at stake
(people's right to affordable food), the unclear benefits of the recent
financialisation of commodity markets and the fact that both real food markets
(with a large part of the world's food reserves labelled either company or
state secret) and derivatives markets will continue to be highly opaque in the
coming years.
Foodwatch
has called on major banks ""to take a first precautionary step by refraining
from speculation with food commodities like soybeans, corn and wheat in their
financial strategies.""  Given the, still, small part of their portfolio
invested in these first necessities of life, this indeed would be a welcome
step.

",Chinese NGO's Green Finance,,,,,,"
I believe everyone received the bank notification that encouraged people to switch to electronic bills in order to increase the banks’ environmental responsibility. However, think carefully about each bank’s daily transactions and deals that leverage large sums of money on domestic and international financial markets in cooperation with both large enterprises and governments. Couldn’t the banking industry have a much larger commitment to environmental responsibility than just encouraging their members to switch to electronic bills?
In China, Environmental Protection NGOs have already recognized that the majority of development projects affecting the environment are only implemented with the aid of financial aid of banks and the finance industry. For large-scale development projects, banking often plays a key role. In China, a rapidly developing industrial society, the endless stream of environmental pollution and the far-reaching impacts of massive engineering projects are constant reminders that better environmental accountability in the banking sector is urgently needed. Moreover, many of today's international large-scale development projects are directly funded by multinational loan financing companies. The plans to build dams along the Mekong River in Laos are one example of this. These developers will have a significant impact on the environment, very possibly leading to an ecological catastrophe, and will need to rely on large loans to complete the project. Therefore, Green Watershed has led a coalition of nine NGOs to launch a ""Green Credit Advocacy"" program in China. Green finance is most importantly about offering loans to projects that will manage their potential environmental impacts, supporting and financing programs that benefit the environment, and creating corresponding policies and management measures. The goal of the above-mentioned “Green Credit Advocacy” program is to advocate for, and monitor, financial institutions to ensure that they fulfill their environmental and social responsibility, as delineated in the 2007 Chinese “Green Credit” policies.
Chinese financial investments also play a vital role for many development projects in countries around the world. So having banks that are committed to green finance will further protect the ecological systems within those countries. One example of this is the highly controversial Rio Blanco copper mine in Peru, the developer of which is China's largest mineral resources provider - Zijin Mining. The Rio Blanco mine not only pollutes the water and threatens the habitat of endangered species, but also harms the indigenous people, impinging on their rights. The financing for Zijin Mining’s operations in Peru, as well as in Mongolia and Myanmar, come from five major Chinese banks.
Over the past four years, the coalition of Green Watershed and 9 other NGOs have worked within China’s banking sector to advocate for green credit policies and record the progress of green finance. Green Watershed has published three annual reports titled, “Environmental Report on Chinese Banks,” to ensure public accountability and supervision. At the same, Green Watershed has worked with more than 200 NGOs from across China to provide capacity building and training for the purpose of enhancing social accountability. Even though the Chinese Government has already issued the 2007 Green Credit Policies, there is little to no supervision of the financial sector on the part of civil society. As such, these policies have insofar been difficult to implement. On the other hand, for NGOs that have combated polluters on the local level for a long time, understanding the concepts and methods of green credit policies has allowed them to combat pollution sites at their source: the funding. Step by step, the phrase ""A well-placed underdog can challenge large forces"" is being realized. Financial institutions, however, remain passive and their efforts do not parallel NGOs’ consistent initiatives. Green Watershed hopes that the banking sector takes steps to publicly disclose their environmental policies and lending principles. There have already been five banks in China, including the Industrial Bank, which have engaged in dialogue with Green Watershed, and the Industrial Bank of China has also sent representatives to attend Green Watershed’s Green Finance trainings.
In addition to research and advocacy, Green Watershed also works on addressing current environmental problems, especially urging banks to increase the environmental responsibility of their operations. This summer in Luliang County, Yunnan Province, incidents of chromium pollution sparked widespread societal concern. In August, Green Watershed conducted a local investigation of the situation. At the end of August, Green Watershed wrote a public letter along with 24 other NGOs to a total of 16 banks, asking them to discontinue financial support of the three liable companies, as well as to pursue measures in the future to prevent funding polluting industries. Two banks replied that they were not currently offering credit to the three liable companies, but the other 14 banks did not reply.
In September 2011, Green Watershed sent letters to the People's Bank of China, the China Banking Regulatory Commission, the Kunming Branch of the People's Bank of China, the China Banking Regulatory Commission, and the Banking Bureau in Yunnan Province, asking them to disclose relevant environmental and financial records and reports that should be public information. The CBRC did not respond, and while the Banking Bureau of Yunnan Province said that they supported the work that Green Watershed was doing, in the end they did not provide any of the requested materials. Written responses all denied responsibility, directing Green Watershed to the Department of Environmental Protection to understand the issues. The People's Bank of China is known for their practice of not accepting letters as a way of refusing to communicate with NGOs. The last organization responded with referencing ""trade secrets"" as their reason for not publicly disclosing any information. This whole process resulted in little, except for announcing to China's banking sector that financial regulators, the environmental protection departments, and civil society are all focusing on supervising the operations of relevant financial organizations to ensure their cooperation with social and environmental responsibility. These groups are keeping an eye towards the future, when there will be more public involvement in these issues, and more pressure if the banking industry ignores green finance policy.
Looking internationally, green finance NGOs and initiatives have already been underway for many years. In 2005, while studying in the United States, I participated in a protest along with ten other mathematics students against a group of banks that were financing environmentally destructive behavior. Today, the campaigns of International NGOs are increasingly advanced and influential. In recent years, the Rainforest Action Network (RAN) protested and exposed a number of large U.S. banks that claimed to be concerned about climate change, but in reality, the banks were heavily subsidizing the coal industry. In 2007, a union of organizations demonstrated their strength by protesting Citibank because it is one of the most powerful financial conglomerates and supporters of coal power in the world. Citibank not only underwrites the most bonds for U.S. electric companies, but also supplied billions of dollars to the MTR Corporation, whose open pit mines have caused severe environmental problems and destruction. Open-pit coal mining requires completely stripping everything above ground level, felling entire areas of forest, and leading to habitat, species, and water damage. This year, the Rainforest Action Network has been at the frontlines, from the street to peoples’ homes, mobilizing tens of thousands of Bank of America members to close their bank accounts in protest of Bank of America’s involvement in funding the U.S. coal industry. Rainforest Action Network says that even though Bank of America, along with six other large U.S. banks, signed the ""Carbon Principle"" in 2008, a commitment to address the problem of climate change within the U.S. electricity industries. But in fact, even after signing the principle, these banks still provide and underwrite loans for more than half of the U.S. coal industry. As such, it is clear these banks have yet to take the carbon principles seriously.
In Britain, the World Development Movement (WDM) along with Amnesty International, the Scottish Friends of the Earth, and other human rights and environmental groups joined together in 2010 to protest the Royal Bank of Scotland’s (RBS) funding of companies that blatantly disregard human rights and environmental protection. One such company is E.ON energy company, which builds coal-fired and gas-fired power plants throughout Europe, and another is the Trafigura Group which conducted large-scale dumping of toxic waste in Côte d'Ivoire. The coalition of British and Scottish groups together created the “RBS Dirty Finances Map” online, and also organized protests in the streets.
In the future, Chinese environmental NGOs will have many challenges to face. Foremost of which is achieving communication between the banking and NGO sectors that is both balanced and respectful. Increasing public awareness and concern for green credit is yet another challenge. These are the types of the difficulties that must be overcome in developing green finance practices in the future. Over the past couple of years, though, Chinese environmental NGOs have already made an impact on the banking sector with just a handful of staff and meager funding. I believe that in the future, civil society will have more power to promote and monitor green finance, as well as hold the banking sector accountable to standards of environmental and social responsibility.

Siem Reap, Cambodia - In a crucial decision for the people and ecosystems of the Mekong River Basin, the governments of Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam agreed today to delay the Xayaburi Dam, the first of eleven dams proposed for the Mekong River, pending further study on the impacts of the proposed Mekong mainstream dams. Japan and other international donors will be asked to assist in conducting the studies. No timetable for the delay was announced.The government representatives did not give a joint press conference, but rather spoke to journalists separately.

""In line with today's important decision, we expect that construction on the Xayaburi Dam will immediately stop and equipment will be cleared from the site. We expect the governments will provide a clear timeline and consultation process for the studies, and that the prior consultation process will remain open.""""The Mekong governments made the right decision today, but it is only the beginning,"" said Ms. Nguy Thi Khanh of Vietnam Rivers Network. ""The governments need to take further steps to make their joint commitment a reality. They should agree on a roadmap for conducting further scientific studies to understand the Mekong River, building on the recommendations of the Strategic Environmental Assessment. They should commit not to pursue any mainstream dams until these studies are complete and meaningful public consultation occurs. We hope the Lao government will act in good faith and immediately halt all construction activities at the dam site and withdraw all construction equipment.""The agreement to delay the Xayaburi Dam and conduct further studies was confirmed at a meeting of the Mekong River Commission (MRC) Council today in Siem Reap, Cambodia. The agreement was reportedly first made by the four Prime Ministers of the MRC Member Countries at the 3rd Mekong-Japan Summit held on the sideline of the 19th ASEAN Summit in Bali, Indonesia in November 2011.""Ultimately the only responsible solution is to cancel the Xayaburi Dam and other dams planned for the Mekong River. We are confident that scientific studies on the Xayaburi Dam's impacts, conducted in a transparent, participatory, and independent manner, will reach the same conclusion,"" said Mr. Teerapong Pomun, Director of Living River Siam, a Thai NGO working to protect rivers and people.The decision builds on the outcomes of a meeting of the four governments last April, when Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam called for further studies of the project's transboundary impacts and public consultations before deciding on the dam. At that time, Vietnam also called for a ten-year moratorium on all mainstream dams in line with the recommendations of a 2010 Strategic Environmental Assessment prepared for the Mekong River Commission. ""While the governments have agreed to a delay, they will eventually need to make a final decision on whether to proceed with the dam,"" said Mr. Chhith Sam Ath, Executive Director of the NGO Forum on Cambodia. ""We believe that scientific evidence and the voices of the people must be taken into account in any further decisions. Alternative energy options exist that are cheaper and cleaner than these dams. The Mekong governments have succeeded at this first test of regional cooperation, but we cannot stop and rest yet.""A study released this week demonstrated that power from Xayaburi and other mainstream dams was not needed to meet Thailand's energy demand, and that cheaper and cleaner options exist that would lower electricity bills and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.The Xayaburi Dam and the other dams proposed for the Mekong River have come under intense local and international scrutiny in the past year. Numerous scientific studies have warned about the potentially harmful impacts of these projects to the region's fisheries, farmers, and local communities.

Today, the German environment organisation urgewald, the South African social and environmental justice organisations groundWork and Earthlife Africa Johannesburg and the international network BankTrack will present new research on the portfolios of the world's leading banks. The study ""Bankrolling Climate Change"" examines commercial banks' lending for the coal industry and provides the first comprehensive climate ranking for financial institutions.
""We chose to look into coal financing as coal-fired power plants are the biggest source of man-made CO2 emissions and the major culprit in the drama of climate change,"" explains Heffa Schuecking of urgewald. ""In spite of the fact that climate change is already having severe impacts on the most vulnerable societies, there is an abundance of plans to build new coal-fired power plants. If banks provide money for these projects, they will wreck all attempts to limit global warming to 2° Celsius,"" says Schuecking.
The organisations examined the portfolios of 93 of the world's leading banks and looked into their support for 31 major coal-mining companies (representing 44% of global coal production) and 40 producers of coal-fired electricity (which together own over 50% of global coal-fired generation capacity). The total value of coal financing provided by these banks since 2005 (the year the Kyoto Protocol came into force) amounts to 232 billion Euro.
The study identifies the top twenty ""climate killers"" in the banking world. Among the top twenty are banks from the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Switzerland, China, Italy and Japan. The top three banks fuelling climate change worldwide are JP Morgan Chase (EUR 16,5 bio.), Citi (EUR 13,7 bio.) and Bank of America (EUR 12,6 bio.).
Coal-fired power plants are not cheap to build. Typically, a 600 Megawatt plant will cost around US$ 2 billion. Power producers therefore rely heavily on banks to provide and mobilize the necessary capital for coal plants. ""Our figures clearly show that coal financing is on the rise,"" notes Tristen Taylor of Earthlife Africa Johannesburg. ""Between 2005 and 2010, coal financing almost doubled. If we don't take Banks to task now, coal financing will continue to grow,"" he warns.
The study looks into the statements of the top climate killer banks and also examines their existing climate policies. ""Interestingly, almost all of the top twenty climate killer banks in our ranking have made far-reaching statements regarding their commitment to combating climate change,"" explains Yann Louvel of BankTrack. ""However, the numbers show that their money is not where their mouth is."" He also notes that the policies many banks have adopted and the voluntary initiatives they have signed on to like the  ""Carbon Principles"" or the ""Climate Principles"" have failed to make any difference in banks' portfolios.
""Our study names and shames the banks that are destabilising our climate system,"" says Bobby Peek from groundWork. ""Plans for new coal fired power plants and coal mines are meeting with fierce resistance all over the world and we are going to begin turning that heat on the banks"", explains Peek. The study calls on banks to become responsible climate actors and to quit coal. According to the NGOs, banks need to shift their portfolios to renewables and energy efficiency and set and implement ambitious CO2 reduction goals for their financed emissions.
The table shows the top twenty financiers of the coal industry since 2005.

",CEDHA Files Equator Principles Due Diligence Review to US EXIM Bank and EDC of Canada on Barrick’s Pascua Lama project,,,Pascua Lama gold mining project ,mining - non coal,Argentina,"

Ottawa Canada y Washington DC - November 25, 2011. The Center for Human Rights and Environment
(CEDHA), along with several local and international groups presented today an Equator Principles Due
Diligence Review to two export credit agencies considering financing Barrick Gold's highly
controversial Pascua Lama gold project, straddling the border between Chile and
Argentina.
Glaciers that are impacted by the Pascua Lama project
The review argues that Pascua Lama is in direct
violation of the Equator Principles, which are global norms laying out
conditions for responsible investment.
The 45 page critique of Barrick's Pascua Lama project, brings together
existing and new evidence showing innumerable social and environmental norms
violations by Barrick's operations at both Pascua Lama (which is set to
commence in the near future) as well as at the adjacent project Veladero.
The executive summary of the review states,
""This report reveals serious project design and implementation flaws of
Barrick's Pascua Lama Project, making this project non-compliant with the
principles and minimum social and environmental standards established by the Equator Principles. This conclusion is based on the analysis of a
number of issues and dimensions of both the Pascua Lama and adjacent Veladero
projects, which are intricately related, including Barrick's impacts and
problems related to:

Glaciers
Waterways
Indigenous rights
Wetland systems (vegas systems)
Project design (such as faults in rock pile design and execution)
Non-compliance of, and attack on, environmental legislation
Transparency and disclosure
Corporate culture
And multiple other issues."" 

As Equator Principle signatory banks, says CEDHA and the adhering
institutions, including the global network Banktrack and the Accountability
Project in the United Status, due to the various impacts sited in this report,
and for Barrick's systemic irresponsible corporate culture evidenced by
accidents such as the recent rock pile collapse
at the Veladero project, Barrick Gold fails to comply with the Equator Principles, and as such, EDC and Eximbank should stay away
from Pascua Lama.
""We believe that a due diligence review of Pascua Lama will be sobering for
EDC and Exim Bank and reveal a company that makes hollow commitments to the
financial institutions at which it seeks support, and then only shirk its
obligations once loans are disbursed.
 
A few weeks ago, Exim Bank and EDC made a locally unannounced visit to the
project, and met with several actors including CEDHA to discuss concerns over
the highly controversial project.
CEDHA employed a similar strategy several years ago, when several EP banks
were considering finance to two controversial pulp mills (Botnia and ENCE) on
the border between Argentina and Uruguay. Complaints then went to ING, Calyon,
and other Equator Principle signatory banks. A few weeks after the complaint,
ING withdrew US$480 million of pledges support to the Finnish company Botnia.

London ",The Stolen Money Trail,,,,,,"
Earlier this month, Swiss bank regulators found that four Swiss banks had not done enough to identify dictators' assets they held. Earlier this year, Britain's Financial Services Authority investigation into London banks found that three quarters of them were not doing enough to verify the sources of some customers' wealth.
These probes shed some light on a system that is failing to stop the flow of corrupt money, a problem that continues to have disastrous consequences for millions of people. Neither regulator, however, has named the banks that have fallen afoul of the rules, nor given any indication they will do so. They also fail to answer the fundamental question of what this money was doing in Swiss or British banks in the first place.
Let's put this in context. Three entrenched, repressive and corrupt regimes fell this year largely because the people they ruled were fed up with epic levels of corruption.
That kind of corruption cannot happen without a bank. Dictators cannot steal millions of dollars from the state, nor accept massive bribes, if the money has to be kept under the bed.
Payments for natural resources like oil and gas do not arrive in dollar bills, they are paid by bank transfer; increasingly, bribes and rake-offs from commercial deals are too. Plus it's safer to keep money out of the country - away from opponents, and accessible if you're ousted from power.
As a result of the convulsions across the Middle East and North Africa, the Swiss were among the first to freeze Tunisian, Egyptian and Libyan assets, beating both the European Union and the United States (the latter only froze Libyan funds).
Following the freeze, Swiss banks identified 470 million Swiss francs ($511 million) in the accounts of Tunisian and Egyptian politicians and 360 million Swiss francs ($391 million) of Libyan assets.
In the banking industry, senior foreign officials, their family members and close associates are known as Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs). Banks are supposed to do extra checks to identify them and the deposits they make because of the possibility of corruption.
According to the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, FINMA, the four Swiss banks got it wrong in obvious ways. One accepted regular seven-figure payments into a PEP's account without checking their origin; the banker who was the client adviser may have blocked attempts to investigate his client. Another bank had a PEP account in which there were ""indications of illegal transactions,"" and the bank failed to treat him as a PEP despite identifying him as related to a ruler - and the fact that another bank had kicked him out as too high-risk.
These banks must now face exposure and stiff fines, or the Swiss regulators' probe will have failed to teach the necessary lessons.
Other European countries have also found assets linked to despots. Germany, for example, froze a $2.8 million account belonging to one of Muammar el-Qaddafi's sons.
When will we find the political will to stop dictators operating out of sight of their own citizens and finally deny safe haven to dirty money and dictators' loot across Europe?
A first step would be for governments and regulators to follow the British and Swiss example and take a hard look at what their banks were doing when they took this money. But they must all go further. The second step must be for governments and regulators to make it unacceptable for banks to take this money in the first place. "

Charlotte NC ",Eight arrested during protest at Bank of America headquarters,Bank of America ,United States,,,,"

Today,
eight people were arrested protesting Bank of America's reckless financing
practices, including the banks role as the lead financier of coal. Two people
were arrested after unfurling a banner reading ""Not with Our Money"" from atop
two 50-foot flagpoles at the entrance of Bank of America's headquarters in
downtown Charlotte.
Six more were arrested below: two while supporting the climbers, and four while
blocking the main entrance to the bank's headquarters. 
""As the
authorities attempt to evict Occupy protestors from public spaces, they are
going to start showing up at Bank of America doorsteps across the country. Bank
of America is in the center of the Occupy Movement because of its reckless
financial practices that put profit before people and planet,"" said Amanda
Starbuck, Rainforest Action Network's Energy and Finance Campaign Director. ""If
Bank of America would like to regain the trust of the 99 percent, it must adopt
sound economic and environmental policies that reflect the values of its
customers. Bank of America can start by getting out of bed with the coal
industry, and shifting its funding toward renewable energy sources that will
have long term benefits for our environment, our health and our economy.""
""Bank
of America is foreclosing on our neighbors and it's foreclosing on our climate.
To be honest, I'm embarrassed that I'm still a customer,"" said Jamie
Trowbridge, an Appalachian State University student who was one of the two
climbers arrested at today's protest. ""Coal is dirty at every stage in its
lifecycle. No longer will Bank of America fund coal with my money. When I get
back to school, I'm going to cut up my BoA debit card, and help other students
do the same.""
In the
past two years alone, Rainforest Action Network has found that Bank of America
has pumped $4.3 billion into the U.S. coal industry; $1.3 billion
more than other top banks. With today's protest, environmentalists have joined
the mounting outrage at Bank of America's reckless financing practices, a
critique which has been on display with the Occupy Movement and with the record
transfer of customer accounts to credit unions. According to the Credit Union
National Association, 700,000 consumers across the nation have joined credit
unions since Sept. 29 and credit unions have added $4.5 billion in new savings
accounts.
Bank of
America funds every sector of the U.S. coal industry, including
companies that operate the most controversial coal-fired power plants and the
most devastating forms of strip mining, including mountaintop removal coal
mining.
Today's
action comes only a month after RAN announced its Not One More Dollar for
Campaign, which asks Bank of America customers to close their accounts until
Bank of America stops subsidizing the coal industry. The international
environmental group has garnered the support of thousands of Bank of America
customers, who in the last few weeks have pledged to close their accounts,
citing the bank's insistence on underwriting the coal industry.  
Coal is
responsible for 40 percent of greenhouse gas emissions and the U.S. is the
world's second largest coal producer. Coal-fired energy generation is
responsible for pollutants that damage cardiovascular and respiratory health
and threaten healthy child development.

Washington, DC ",Friends of the Earth US statement in support of Occupy Wall Street,,,,,,"
The hope and ambition of the Occupy movement has reminded us that we 
need to remake financial and economic systems so that they serve people 
and the planet, not the other way around. We are challenged to consider 
ways in which we can not only resist market fundamentalism, but help 
create new models that promote prosperity, social equity and 
environmental sustainability.
The recent outpouring of public support for fundamental economic 
justice, as expressed through the Occupy Wall Street movement, has 
inspired and energized those of us at Friends of the Earth.
The Occupy actions are a moral response to massive and growing 
inequality in the United States and around the world, which manifests 
itself not only through disparities of wealth and opportunity, but of 
political power. In the last decade, the influence of big business has 
expanded to such an extent that our civil and political systems have 
largely been captured by corporate lobbyists and campaign donations.
The gross imbalances of economic and political power between the one 
percent and the rest of society are the result of decades of misguided 
ideology (neoliberalism) that has exalted unrestrained markets, 
denigrated government and maximized the influence of corporations over 
our economic and political lives. Today, functions that were once the 
domain of the public sector -- from the provision of services, to the 
protection of our commons, to the fighting of our wars and even the 
writing of our laws -- have been taken over by corporations that put 
profit before the public interest.
The financial sector, in particular, has created for itself an 
outsized role in our economic and political systems. At its height, the 
financial sector accounted for some 40 percent of U.S. GDP, a product of
 its ability to concentrate wealth and then use that wealth to make 
money off of money. But it is becoming increasingly clear that the well 
being of Wall Street is not necessarily linked with the well being of 
society at large; today, we see that vast amounts of wealth can be 
amassed by an elite in the speculative economy and yield jobless 
""growth"" that offers little benefit to most people's lives in the real 
economy.
Over the past two decades, Wall Street's growing economic power also 
provided it with greater political and marketing power; not only was the
 financial sector able to buy deregulatory favors in Washington, but it 
also wove an enticing narrative around the wisdom and superiority of 
financial markets that captured the imaginations of policymakers and the
 public alike.
Unfettered markets and the pursuit of self-interest became not just 
the basis of our economic policy, but the answer to social inequality 
and environmental problems. Just a few short years ago, carbon trading 
became the centerpiece of our national climate change agenda. Many 
environmentalists were ready to create a massive carbon derivatives 
market and hand it over to Wall Street - even at a time when big banks 
had just destroyed our economy and forced us to bail them out.
We are all now facing the stark fiscal consequences of that bailout, 
and the job destruction caused by unregulated recklessness on Wall 
Street. Now the time has come for the environmental movement to 
acknowledge that the struggle for economic and environmental justice is 
one and the same. Rising unemployment, along with the bank bailout, the 
economic rescue package, two wars and the Bush tax cuts have forced us 
into a budget deal in which the middle class, the poor, the marginalized
 and the environment are bearing the burden while the one percent fail 
to shoulder their fair share.
Unless we act in solidarity with those engaged in diverse struggles 
for justice, environmental groups run the risk of protecting our 
parochial interests while harming the broader public interest. Although 
tax reform is not typically considered part of the environmental agenda,
 environmentalists should be working not only for the end of polluter 
tax giveaways, but also for the end of the Bush tax cuts, the imposition
 of a Wall Street transactions tax, a stop to offshore tax avoidance, 
increased taxes for the wealthy, and other progressive tax policies. 
Progressive tax, economic and financial policies are not only critical 
for our environment, but are also fairer and more equitable for our 
society.
We stand with those in the Occupy Wall Street movement and salute 
their efforts to refocus the national conversation on how wealth and 
power have become increasingly concentrated, and we call on others, 
especially in the environmental community, to show their support.
The moral outrage of the Occupy movement has made us recommit 
ourselves to our work in the areas of democratic governance, corporate 
power, tax and budget policy, big banks, trade rules and financial 
markets and regulation. We believe that poorly formed policies in each 
of these areas drive environmental destruction.
The vitality of this movement has been a strong reminder to us at 
Friends of the Earth that mass movements have usually been the basis for
 progressive change in our country and around the world. While we will 
continue to advocate for accountability and change in Washington, we 
recognize that change will not come from Washington -- it will come to 
Washington.

Brazil ","Belo Monte dam does not meet sustainability criteria of world's private banks, say rights groups",Banco do Brasil ,Brazil,Belo Monte dam ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"
The controversial Belo
Monte Dam, slated for construction in Brazil's
Amazon region, does not meet the standards of an international framework used
by the world's largest private banks to evaluate sustainability, say human
rights groups in Brazil.
In a letter sent to Itaú,
Banco do Brasil, Bradesco, Santander, and Caixa Econômica Federal, 150
Brazilian social and environmental organizations warned that Belo Monte
developer Norte Energia, S.A. (NESA) has not complied with the Equator
Principles, a set of voluntary standards created in 2003 that aid private
financiers in assessing and managing social and environmental risk in project
finance. As signatories of the Equator Principles, the five banks commit to not
providing loans to projects where the borrower will not or is unable to comply
with the Principles' respective social and environmental policies and
procedures.
The five banks have been
mentioned by the Brazilian government as possible co-financiers of the Belo
Monte Dam, and at least one, Banco do Brasil, has been mentioned as the
top-runner to co-finance nearly $20 billion reais that would be
disbursed by the Brazilian National Development Bank (BNDES) to NESA. The
Brazilian civil society groups argue that BNDES is using tax-payer funds to
finance what is ultimately a costly boondoggle. In October, Credit Suisse
reduced its outlook for Cemig and Light, two Brazilian electric utilities that
joined NESA, stating that the project's rate of return is far below government
estimates.
""The legal violations that
have accumulated throughout the planning process of the Belo Monte Dam clearly
illustrate that the project does not live up to the standards of the Equator
Principles. We recommend that Equator Principles banks stay away from
co-financing Belo Monte, because the reputational risks associated with the
project are very large,"" said Zachary Hurwitz, Policy Coordinator at
International Rivers, which published a risk report with Amigos da
Terra-Amazônia Brasileira in early 2011 detailing the project's history.
In order for any of the
five private banks to co-finance a loan for the Belo Monte Dam, they would have
to illustrate that NESA has complied with the guidelines' ten principles. For
example, Principle 5 requires borrowers to ""consult with project affected
communities in a structured and culturally appropriate manner,"" and to ""ensure
their free, prior and informed consultation and facilitate their informed
participation as a means to establish whether a project has adequately
incorporated affected communities' concerns.""
However, recent evidence
suggests that NESA, a project consortium composed of nearly 75% state-owned
enterprises, did not hold free, prior, and informed consultations with affected
indigenous communities.
In a hearing of Brazil's Regional Federal Tribunal, judge Selene
Maria de Almeida decided that three tribes who live on a 100km stretch of the Xingu River
that would be dried out because of the dam- the Juruna, the Arara, and the
Xikrín Kayapó- had not been properly consulted. Environmental agency IBAMA and
state electric utility Eletrobras, the largest holder in NESA, only began
studying the project's impacts on tribes in 2008, three years after the
Brazilian Congress had approved the project. The Brazilian Constitution
mandates that developers must hold proper consultations before a development
project that impacts indigenous people is approved by the Brazilian
Congress.  If de Almeida's decision is upheld in court, Belo Monte would
be suspended until proper consultations were held. 
The warning letter also
argues that the developer has not complied with Principle 4 of the Equator
Principles, which requires the borrower to create an Action Plan that
""implements mitigation measures, corrective actions and monitoring measures to
manage the impacts and risks"" in compliance with host country social and
environmental regulations. An injunction brought by Carlos Castro Martins at
the end of September barred NESA from beginning any work that would interfere
with the natural flow of the Xingu river, after it was found that the developer
had not properly assessed the risks to local fish stocks, nor planned a program
to mitigate the impacts on families who make a living from fishing.
The warning letter also
argues that NESA has not complied with Principle 6, which requires the borrower
to create a grievance mechanism as a condition of managing the risk of Category
A and B projects. The Equator Principles consider Category A projects to have
significant risk, while Category B are considered to have limited risk.
The Equator Principles,
last revised in 2006, are directly based on the Performance Standards of the
International Finance Corporation (IFC), which were revised and strengthened in
2011. The new version of the Performance Standards includes language that
protects indigenous peoples' right to informed consultation and participation,
and, in certain cases, upholds their right to free, prior, and informed
consent. The Equator Principles will also be updated in 2012, and are likely to
adopt the stronger language.

Paris and Nice ",French banks : a citizen rating reveals what is going on underneath their activities,Belfius ,Belgium,,,,"
Nice and Paris, November 2, 2011 – A day before the opening of
 the G20 in Cannes, and while the financial turmoil brings governments 
to negotiate again with banks on sovereign debts and on their 
recapitalisation needs, 
Attac France and Les Amis de la Terre (Friends of the Earth France) 
publish today their report : Banks under citizen pressure : time for being accountable . This 
study comes after a citizen evaluation launched in April by these two 
organizations as part of their joint campaign ""Banks are ours!"" . It 
evaluates the practices of the ten main banking groups operating in 
France in five areas of their activity : financial stability, their 
users-customers, 
their employees, the environment and local populations, and democracy.  Attac and FoE France today launch the publication of this report, as 
part of the Peoples's Forum in Nice, organised in parallel to the G20 in
 Cannes, and gathering representatives of civil society coming from 
various locations in the world to show their opposition to G20 policies 
and defend alternatives supported by citizen movements.  Two years after the French government saved them, French banks are once 
more facing huge troubles, and Dexia has just even gone bankrupt. Their 
leaders claim that their current problems don't come from hazardous 
speculation but rather from their citizen investments in state bonds, 
which were unanimously considered as safe assets until recently.  So, the bankers, ""responsible but not guilty"" ? Nay. It is time that 
citizens put their nose in their business. The citizen rating exercise that Attac and FoE France conducted shows that the official discourses of
bankers and European financial ministers do not reflect the reality. ""While they think again about bringing the banks out of the abyss, 
our work brings to light the fact that banks don't fulfil their general
interest mission"", stresses Thomas Coutrot, Attac co-president. The 
report reveals indeed that they take unconsidered risks, searching for 
excessive profits. They abuse their customers, particularly the poorest, and their
employees, particularly those in direct contact with the customers. They neglect the ecological and social consequences of their decisions. They
don't take into account social stakeholders' views but solely those of their shareholders.  Juliette Renaud, financial actors accountability campaigner for FoE France, comments : ""Banks want to make us believe that they took the ecological and social turn by advertising their CSR policies. But reality
on the ground is way different, big banks finance more and more dodgy deals, violating the rights of local communities and damaging the environment and the climate in a non-reversible manner"".  FoE France and Attac have set up a ranking of the banks related to their
 practices : many of them are in the red in the five areas studied, 
while only la Nef obtains the maximum score in three areas (speculation and 
risks taken, commercial policies, social and environmental impacts). In 
the general
ranking, it is followed by the Crédit Coopératif, and then by La Banque 
Postale and Dexia, while the biggest banks (Crédit Agricole, Société
Générale, HSBC, BNP Paribas) are far behind. Mutualist groups BPCE and 
Crédit Mutuel-CIC get a zero since they did not even dare to answer the 
questionnaire, despite demands to do so from several customers and 
unions these past months.  Since 2008, the G20 and the governments have let the banks continue to 
meet their only short term interests, and those of their executives and shareholders, being sure to be bailed out if things would turn bad 
again. The potential nationalisation of the banks, seen as unavoidable 
by some people, will only make sense if it implies a profound and 
sustainable democratisation of the top level banks instances, where all 
the
stakeholders interested by the consequences of the banks practices must 
be represented. FoE France and Attac invite more than ever citizens and 
civil society to take back the banking system : ""Banks are ours!"".   The full report and its synthesis are in download on this page (only
in French). This study comes after a first report published in June 2011, Are banks transparent? For more information and to download it (only in
French), go to this page.   For more information on the ""Banks are ours!"" campaign, click here and

Brazil ",Hundreds Occupy Belo Monte Dam Site in Brazilian Amazon,,,Belo Monte dam ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"

Sheyla Juruna, indigenous leader from Brazil,
available for interviews in Washington, D.C.  (Hi-res photos available upon request)
Altamira, Brazil  Hundreds of
indigenous leaders, fishermen and riverine people from the Xingu River basin
have gathered to occupy the Belo Monte Dam construction site in a peaceful
protest to stop its construction in Altamira,
located in the state of Pará in the heart of the Brazilian Amazon. They have
vowed to permanently occupy the site and are calling on allied organizations
and movements to join them.
The Trans-Amazon Highway
(BR-230) has been blocked around the Santo Antônio village, where it passes the
proposed construction site. Groups are demanding the presence of a Brazilian
government high-level official at the site to initiate a new round of
negotiations that are transparent, inclusive and respectful of the rights of
local people affected by the dam.
""Belo
Monte will only succeed if we do nothing about it. We will not be silent. We
will shout out loud and we will do it now,"" said Juma Xipaia, a local
indigenous leader. ""We only demand what our Constitution already ensures
us: our rights. Our ancestors fought so we could be here now. Many documents
and meetings have already transpired and nothing has changed. The machinery
continues to arrive to destroy our region.""
The
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) of the Organization of
American States (OAS) has requested explanation as to why the Brazilian
Government did not act to ensure the rights of indigenous peoples affected by
the dam, as requested by the IAHCR in April. According to the OAS, the
Brazilian Government has an obligation of consulting and informing indigenous
peoples who will be affected by the dam prior to construction.
Yesterday,
the government of Brazil
refused to attend a closed hearing convened by the IAHCR intended to foster
dialogue toward resolving conflict and discuss failures in protecting the
rights of indigenous peoples threatened by the proposed Belo Monte Dam. Plans
for the project ignore international protections such as the right to free,
prior and informed consent, and jeopardize the health, livelihood and ancestral
lands of thousands of indigenous peoples.
Last
Monday, a federal judge in Brazil
voted that the environmental licensing of the controversial Belo Monte Dam is
illegal given the lack of consultations with affected indigenous communities.

BankTrack, the global NGO network monitoring private sector bank operations, calls upon the Equator Principles Financial Institutions (EPFIs) to ensure that the next version of Equator Principles will better deliver on their core  Outside Job; make a positive difference to project affected communities and to the environment.
The Equator Principles Association, meeting this week in Washington DC for their Annual Meeting, is about to publish the draft text of the new version of the Equator Principles (EPIII). The update became necessary after the International Finance Corporation recently adopted a new version of their Performance Standards, to which the Equator Principles are pegged.
A new report published today by BankTrack makes numerous detailed recommendations to the EP Association on how the new Principles can move from being primarily a risk management tool for adopting banks to a set of commitments that also make a substantial difference to people and planet. Amongst other things, BankTrack calls upon the EPFIs to:

Dramatically expand the transparency of the Principles and the Association, as well as the disclosure of information by clients to local stakeholders.
Increase the accountability of the initiative and adopting banks towards stakeholders
Expand the scope of the Principles, to cover all financial services provided to clients to finance projects
Adequately deal with the impact of bank operations on climate change
Adequately deal with the human rights obligations of banks

The report observes that ""over the last years the EPFIs have improved mainly on the inner workings of the Principles, but that these efforts appear to focus more on managing the risks banks associate with adopting the Principles itself than with improving the impact the Principles are supposed to make on communities and the environment. The Equator Principles thus risk to become an inward looking initiative, largely irrelevant to outside stakeholders""
To counter this, the report calls upon the EPFIs to turn their attention and get the outside job done. This should happen by developing a set of Principles.. ""based on the notion that proper risk management for all involved requires transparency of process, inclusion rather than secrecy, a recognition of the fallibility of everyone and therefore the need for accountability and access to redress, dialogue rather than desk studies as a means to understand perspectives and risks, the careful weighing of options and legitimate interests of all involved, an understanding of the limits to business imposed by nature and the environment, as well as the fundamental rights of all people, and in general a clear understanding of the responsibility of a bank to help achieve a more sustainable world""
""This overhaul and redirection of the Equator Principles is already long overdue, but the Equator Association now has a real opportunity to deliver on their outside job,"", says Johan Frijns, coordinator of BankTrack; ""while they are at it they can also restore some of the trust that the public has lost in the banking sector after the financial crisis""
BankTrack will carefully monitor the further development and subsequent implementation of the new Equator Principles in the months to come.

San Francisco ",Polo Resources Ltd under fire from human rights organizations on the eve of their AGM,,,Phulbari coal mine ,mining - coal ,Bangladesh,"
A letter signed by over 80 civil society
organizations worldwide was sent to Polo Resources and other investors today,
calling on them to withdraw their support of the proposed Phulbari Coal Project
in Bangladesh.
The letter is signed by leading human
rights and environmental organizations based in 25 countries, and identifies a
wide range of serious human rights violations and environmental risks
associated with the project.
The Phulbari Coal Project is controlled by
Global Coal Management Resources plc (GCM), a London-based company, and is the
company's principal asset.
GCM's controversial Phulbari Coal Project
faces massive opposition in northwest Bangladesh, where it threatens to
bulldoze the lands of tens of thousands of mostly farming and indigenous
households for whom land is a source of food and a means of survival.  
Said one women interviewed in Phulbari,
""We don't want the mine. Then where will we, the people, go?  What will we eat?  If the government wants to set up the mine
then our children will die.""
Polo Resources, which currently holds
nearly one-third (29.81%) of all GCM shares, is one of the largest investors in
the controversial mining project. 
The civil society letter sent out to Polo
and other investors calling on them to disinvest in GCM is being circulated two
days before Polo's annual general meeting, to be held in Bermuda on Friday,
October 21, 2011, with the aim of alerting investors to the highly risky nature
of Polo's investment in the Phulbari project. 
Polo is already facing challenges in
maintaining the confidence of its investors: Since mid-August of this year,
Polo has been struggling to recover from the fall of its share price by over
20%.  Just last month, Polo announced
that it was instructing advisers to evaluate strategic options for its stake in
GCM, thereby setting off rumors that Polo had grown weary of waiting for a
return on its investment in GCM and was preparing to dispose of its holding.
A major source of the delay on the project
has been controversy over the project impacts in Bangladesh:
""This is the largest grassroots resistance
to a single project that I have seen in my career-and for good reason,"" notes
Joanna Levitt, Executive Director of International
Accountability Project (IAP), a
human rights group that has been following the case since 2008.
""The project would destroy 14,500 acres of
fertile farmland, in a region that now serves as the rice bowl for the
Bangladesh, a country in which nearly half of all people currently do not have
enough to eat,"" Levitt notes.
""The communities in the Phulbari region
have made it very clear that they are willing to risk their lives to stop this
project,"" Levitt added.
The same sentiment was echoed by Anu
Muhammad, Professor of Economics at Bangladesh's Jahangirnagar University, speaking
from his home in Dhaka today.
""People of Phulbari and in the neighboring
village of Barapukuria are in high spirits. 
They are ready to die to oppose this project, and will never allow open
pit in their area.""
The people the project would displace are
at least 2,200 Indigenous people, according to Cultural Survival, a Boston-based human right organization. 
""To them the mine means ethnocide,"" says
Paula Palmer, who recently launched an international campaign to halt the
project as Director of Cultural Survival's Global Response Program.
Efforts to push forward the coalmine
despite strong opposition have resulted in bloodshed.  In August of 2006, paramilitary forces opened
fire on as many as 70,000 people demonstrating against the project in Phulbari,
killing three people and injuring more then 100. 
Human right organizations have repeatedly
expressed concern about a high risk of further violence against people fighting
the mine.  Despite the risks, resistance
to the project appears to be growing, with huge protests involving as many as
100,000 people continuing over the past six years. "

Brussels ",Overheid: maak van Dexia een maatschappelijk nuttige bank!,Belfius ,Belgium,,,,"
 

De huidige situatie creëert voor de overheid een unieke kans om resoluut te kiezen voor financieringen die de samenleving nodig heeft 
De tegenprestaties die gevraagd worden in ruil voor de redding met belastinggeld dienen een publieke politieke beslissing te zijn die rekening houdt met alle stakeholders 

Door Dexia Bank België (DBB) te redden van de grillen van de beurs wordt ruimte gecreëerd. Ruimte om op lange termijn te denken. Aan de overheid deze ruimte te gebruiken om van DBB een bank ten dienste van de noden van onze samenleving te maken.
 
Welke bank zal de overheid van Dexia willen maken? Gaan we terug naar business as usual of wordt de inzet van miljarden belastinggeld dit maal verstandig gebruikt? Het ware kapitaal van DBB is het spaargeld dat ze beheert. Dit vormt de basis voor verdere bankactiviteiten. Dit maatschappelijk kapitaal heeft de overheid, in tegenstelling tot bij Fortis, gelukkig niet uit handen gegeven. Nu is het zaak maatschappelijk verantwoord met dit spaargeld om te springen.
 
Unieke kansDe huidige situatie creëert voor de overheid een unieke kans om resoluut te kiezen voor financieringen die de samenleving nodig heeft. Onze samenleving staat voor uitdagingen die een specifieke financiering vereisen: de vergrijzing vraagt aangepaste huisvesting voor onze bejaarden, onze scholen zijn aan een stevige onderhoudsbeurt toe, noodzakelijke investeringen in milieu-technologie zullen tijd nodig hebben om economisch rendabel te zijn, enzovoort. Dexia zou, naast de financiering van openbare besturen, ook op deze vlakken een belangrijke rol kunnen vervullen.
 
Maar is dit waar de overheid voor gaat? Sommige commentaren doen geloven dat men van Dexia zo snel mogelijk weer een winstmachine wil maken, een bank die aan zijn aandeelhouders en obligatieverstrekkers wederom rendementen van 13% en meer belooft. Uit welke activiteiten de winst gepuurd wordt maakt niet uit, als ze het maar mogelijk maken dat de bank zo snel mogelijk weer verkocht kan worden aan de hoogste bieder. Als het misloopt draait de belastingbetaler er wel voor op. Het kan ook anders. De overheid kan ook gaan voor een vrij stabiel en redelijker rendement, uit investeringen in de productieve economie, zonder al te grote risico's te nemen en zonder de spaarders en kredietnemers uit te persen. Zo'n rendement is voor langetermijninvesteerders als pensioenfondsen en verzekeringen momenteel waarschijnlijk zelfs interessanter dan een jojo van grote winsten en zware verliezen.
Het lijkt Netwerk Vlaanderen evident dat een door de overheid recht gehouden Dexia kiest om te investeren in de productieve economie, zich ver af houdt van casino-activiteiten, niet meewerkt aan belastingontwijking, maatschappelijk schadelijke investeringen mijdt en zich pro-actief inschrijft als financier van de maatschappelijke noden van de toekomst.
Toch zijn we er niet gerust in. De vorige bankenreddingen waren op dat vlak zeker geen stichtend voorbeeld. En weinig garandeert dat, als het politieke spierballengerol opnieuw gaat liggen, het nu anders zal zijn. Daarom stellen wij voor dat over de richting waar de overheid met het geredde Dexia uit wil, niet - zoals bij Fortis en KBC - enkel gedebatteerd en besloten mag worden in besloten kringen van technische experts. De tegenprestaties die gevraagd worden in ruil voor de redding met belastinggeld dienen een publieke politieke beslissing te zijn die rekening houdt met alle stakeholders. De uiteindelijke keuze mag zeker niet overgelaten worden aan de directie van de bank.

San Francisco ","As occupy Wall Street gains momentum, an effort to close consumer accounts from Bank of America is launched",Bank of America ,United States,,,,"

Bank
customers around the country have an opportunity to show their discontent with
the big banks by pledging to close their Bank of America accounts as part of a
new effort launched today from Rainforest Action Network. The ‘not one more
dollar' pledges will be bundled-much like the big banks packaged mortgages for
sale-and presented to Bank of America executives in protest of the bank's
funding of coal, the country's number one contributor to climate change. (1)
""People
are fed up with Wall Street banks foreclosing on their homes, laying off
workers, hiking consumer fees, and bankrolling industries that are destroying
our planet,"" said Amanda Starbuck, director of Rainforest Action Network's
energy and finance program. ""We need Bank of America to show leadership in
protecting the health of our economy and our communities.""
The
list of grievances over Bank of America's behavior is a long. It has recently
announced it will charge customers $60 a year to use their debit cards at the
same time that the bank is laying off 30,000 employees. Bank of America is also
a leading forecloser of Americans' homes and the leading funder of coal
projects that are polluting our communities and wrecking the climate.
Over
the past two years, Bank of America has invested more than $4.3 billion in
coal. It is the biggest bank in the United States and the biggest
underwriter of the coal industry-bankrolling coal mining, infrastructure
investments and coal plants around the country. Coal fired power plants kill
between 13,000 and 34,000 people a year--as many as one person every 15
minutes.
""Corporate
power has infected our political system. The same interests that have blocked
federal action on climate change are being bankrolled by BoA to cook our
climate and spew pollution into our communities,"" said Starbuck. ""Bank of
America's customers want the bank to take responsibility for the social and
environmental consequences of its lending practices, and this pledge is a way
for people to communicate that.""
In
November, Rainforest Action Network will release a report that examines Bank of
America's coal investments and its claims to support environmental
responsibility. People can pledge to close their accounts or forswear the use
of Bank of America ATMs at http://ran.org/boapledge.
###
Notes
to the editor:
1. RAN
is demanding that Bank of America spend Not One More Dollar on coal. It's time
that the bank makes responsible investments in green energy solutions instead
of bankrolling the coal industry. RAN's demands include:

 No
financing for companies pursuing new coal-fired power plants and life-extending
retrofits of existing coal-fired power plants. 
 No
financing for companies engaged in mountaintop removal coal mining. 
 No
financing for companies pursuing coal export infrastructure. 
 Shifting the balance of energy financing to support power generation that is
less threatening to our health and environment.

",Myitsone Dam Suspension a Breakthrough for Burma’s Civil Society,,,Myitsone hydroelectric dam ,energy plants - dams,Myanmar,"
In a stunning move, Burma's President today announced that the Myitsone Dam on the Irrawaddy River would be halted ""to respect the will of the 
people."" International Rivers welcomes this decision as a fantastic 
breakthrough for civil society groups in Burma and their partners in 
China and around the world.
Grace Mang, program coordinator at 
International Rivers, said: ""The suspension of the Myitsone Dam is a 
great success for civil society groups in Burma and throughout the 
world. The decision shows that dam builders can no longer rely on 
dictatorial governments to push through projects that are rejected by 
their populations. China Power Investment Corporation and other dam 
builders should now reconsider other planned projects on the Irrawaddy 
and Salween rivers.""
The US$3.6 billion Myitsone hydropwer project would have submerged the confluence of the Irrawaddy River in Kachin 
State and created a reservoir the size of Singapore. The project is the 
central part of a seven-dam cascade proposed to be built with $20 
billion in Chinese investment.  It is located in one of the world's top 
biodiversity hotspots, would displace 12,000 people, and would 
irreversibly affect Burma's central river system and rice-growing area. The
 Myitsone Dam is strongly opposed by the Kachin People's Organization, 
Nobel Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, civil society organizations in 
Burma, and their partner groups in China, Thailand, and around the 
world. International Rivers is supporting the Burmese NGOs through 
technical analysis, corporate research and international 
awareness-raising. "

Edinburgh ",'Girl Band' Protest at Royal Bank of Scotland sponsored low carbon investment conference,Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS)  ,United Kingdom,Canadian tar sands ,oil and gas,Canada,"

A 'girl
band' of environmental activists dressed as 'oily bankers' protested outside
the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) sponsored Scottish Low Carbon Investment
Conference (1) in Edinburgh this morning.
The
'girl band' sang a well-known chart song with lyrics altered to tell the story
of RBS's 'oily investments', which finance companies involved in some of the
world's most environmentally destructive activities, including oil and gas
exploration, the development of new coal plants and the mining of tar sands in
Canada, described as the most destructive industrial project on Earth (2).  Since the banking crisis in 2008, RBS has received more than £45billion in bail
out money from the UK Government - the equivalent of £736 from every man, woman
and child in the UK.
RBS is 83% owned by the British taxpayer and yet the taxpayer has no say in the
type of investments that RBS makes, and the company continues to invest in
projects and businesses that are fuelling climate change and causing
environmental destruction and human rights abuses.  While Friends of the Earth Scotland welcomes support for low carbon investments,
the organisation questions the integrity of RBS's involvement in the Scottish
Low Carbon Investment Conference. As the UK bank most heavily involved in
financing the fossil fuel industry, RBS's activities totally undermine the
transition to a low carbon future.  Stan Blackley, Chief Executive of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said:  ""RBS's sponsorship of this conference is utterly hypocritical and
completely two-faced. These 'oily bankers' are keen to be seen promoting events
like this because it distracts attention from their major links to some of the most
environmentally damaging projects on earth, such as the Canadian tar sands and
deep water oil exploration in the Arctic.  ""The 'Oil Bank of Scotland' is using our, the taxpayer's, money to finance
activities that are driving climate change, damaging the environment, causing
massive human rights abuses, and contributing to inequalities all around the
world. We want the bank to adopt strict ethical and environmental investment
criteria on how it uses our money. If it is serious about investment in low
carbon technologies, then that action must come hand in hand with immediate
dis-investment in dirty energy.""  Earlier this month, RBS pulled out of conducting further financial deals with
cluster-bomb manufacturers after its investments in the controversial industry
were exposed. Friends of the Earth Scotland is calling on the bank to continue
the improvement of its investment practices and shift its investment from
polluting fossil fuel extraction to the development of safe, clean, renewable
sources of energy and electricity instead.

For more information on the Scottish Low Carbon Investment Conference, see: www.slciconference.com  2. Between 2007 and 2009, RBS led the underwriting of more than $7.5bn worth of
loans to multinational oil companies mining tar sands in Canada. For

'Clean up RBS' campaign, see: www.foe-scotland.org.uk/cleanupRBS.  According to research published in March 2011 ranking 35 international banks
according to the amount of finance they had been involved in providing to the
20 biggest coal based electricity generators, RBS was ranked 3rd; and to the 20
biggest coal mining operators, RBS was ranked 8th.  In 2009, RBS loaned $100 million to Scottish oil company Cairn Energy. Less than
a month later, Cairn announced that it was able to move its plans to drill in
the arctic forward by one year.  3. Friends of the Earth Scotland is Scotland¹s leading environmental campaigning

Laos ",Illegal Construction on the Xayaburi Dam Forges Ahead,,,Xayaburi dam ,energy plants - dams,Laos,"
Bangkok, Thailand: A field visit to the site of the proposed Xayaburi Dam has revealed that construction on the dam's access road and work-camp is rapidly forging ahead in spite of commitments by the Government of Laos to temporarily suspend the project. The trip to the Xayaburi Dam site on July 23rd revealed that a substantial construction camp has been established near Ban Talan village with at least a few hundred workers. An access road leading down to the dam site was also under construction and some land has been cleared without compensation provided to the owners.
""The Government of Laos appears to be set on unilaterally moving forward with the Xayaburi Dam in violation of international law and its commitments under the 1995 Mekong Agreement,"" said Ame Trandem, Southeast Asia Program Director for International Rivers. ""By building this dam, Laos is disregarding its regional commitments and robbing the future of millions of people in the region who rely upon the river for their livelihood and food security.""
Representatives from the four lower Mekong countries had originally been scheduled to meet in Phnom Penh this Friday, in order to discuss the next steps in the Mekong River Commission's (MRC) Procedures for Notification, Prior Consultation and Agreement (PNPCA), the regional decision-making process for the Xayaburi Dam. On Tuesday, the meeting was postponed indefinitely without explanation.
As input into the future meeting, International Rivers has submitted to the MRC and regional governments a legal opinion by the US law firm Perkins Coie which states that ""The Mekong Agreement precludes any unilateral decisions that threatens the river's ecological balance or impacts the needs of people who rely on it."" The opinion concludes ""Lao PDR's unilateral action to prematurely terminate the PNPCA process, without allowing its neighbor countries to properly conclude that process, violates the Mekong Agreement, and therefore international law.""
""This hypocrisy needs to stop,"" said Pianporn Deetes, Thailand Campaign Coordinator for International Rivers. ""If Laos is committed to cooperating with its neighbors on the project, then the government should stop all construction activities and start dealing honestly and truthfully.""
Less than two weeks ago, the Government of Laos was reported to have confirmed to a top U.S. diplomat for Asia that the dam's suspension would continue, which was welcomed as a ""forward-leaning"" decision by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. This came after Laos attempted to call the regional decision-making process complete at an Informal Donor Meeting of the Mekong River Commission, held on 24 June in Phnom Penh, despite calls from its neighbors for further study and consultation.
Only a few months earlier, on 19 April, the four governments had reached an agreement to defer the decision over the Xayaburi Dam for a future Ministerial-level meeting, which is expected to occur in October or November.
Despite the Xayaburi Dam's construction forging ahead, the next steps in the regional decision-making process and how the knowledge gaps identified by the MRC's Technical Review of the project will be filled remain unclear.
The Xayaburi Dam is currently the single greatest threat facing the Mekong River and its people. The project would forcibly resettle over 2,100 people and directly affect over 202,000 people. It threatens the extinction of approximately 41 fish species, including the critically endangered Mekong Giant Catfish and an additional 23 to 100 migratory fish species would be threatened through a blocked fish migration route. These impacts in turn will affect the livelihoods and food security of millions of people in the region.
Vietnamese experts at a seminar last week presented research findings indicating that all 12 dams planned for the Mekong Mainstream could result in one billion dollars in annual losses to Vietnam, due to impacts on the rich and productive Mekong Delta.

Ethiopia ",UN Body Calls for Suspension of Gibe III Dam to Protect World Heritage,,,Gibe III dam ,energy plants - dams,Ethiopia,"
Places like the Grand Canyon, Taj Mahal and Great Wall of China are of such outstanding cultural or natural value that the world's governments have committed to protect and preserve them for future generations. The UN's World Heritage Committee recently called on the Ethiopian government and Chinese financiers to suspend the Gibe III hydropower project to fulfill their obligation for the protection of such a site. Read more about this exciting development.
Lake Turkana in Northern Kenya is the world's largest desert lake. According to the World Heritage Committee, its unique ecosystem has made it ""an outstanding laboratory for the study of plant and animal communities."" The area's rich fossil finds have allowed reconstructing the history of animal species and mankind over the past 2 million years. Thanks to these unique properties, Lake Turkana was recognized and protected as a World Heritage Site in 1997.
Lake Turkana's umbilical cord is the Omo River, on which it depends for close to 90 percent of its water inflow. The Gibe III Dam, which is currently under construction in Ethiopia, would disrupt this water supply. It would store almost a full year's worth of the river's flow, divert more water for the irrigation of sugar cane plantations, and completely alter the river's natural cycle, on which the fragile ecosystems of the Lower Omo Valley and Lake Turkana have come to depend over thousands of years. A study commissioned by the African Development Bank found that the dam would likely cause a significant drop in the lake's water level, increase its salinity, and threaten the unique ecosystem for which the lake was recognized as a World Heritage Site in the first place. The Gibe III Dam is being built by an Italian company. ICBC, a Chinese state-owned bank, has approved funding for the project, and China's export credit agency is financing the transmission lines. The dam would not only have devastating impacts on the Omo River and Lake Turkana, but also on the 500,000 indigenous people who depend on the river and lake for their livelihoods.The threats posed to Lake Turkana spurred the World Heritage Centre, which coordinates international efforts regarding World Heritage Sites on a daily basis, into action. In March 2011, the Centre expressed concern about the construction of the Gibe III Dam in a letter to the Ethiopian government and requested additional information, including the project's environmental impact assessment. The government claimed that it had taken precautionary measures to protect Lake Turkana, but did not provide any relevant documents to the Centre.In June 2011 the World Heritage Committee, which oversees the protection of World Heritage Sites around the globe, convened for its annual meeting. The Committee took note of the threats and decided to take action for the protection of Lake Turkana and a host of other sites. It expressed ""utmost concern"" about the proposed construction of the Gibe III Dam and urged the Ethiopian government to ""immediately halt all construction"" on the project. It asked the governments of Kenya and Ethiopia to invite a monitoring mission to review the dam's impacts on Lake Turkana, and encouraged financial institutions ""to put on hold their financial support"" until the Committee's next annual meeting in June 2012. Interestingly, both China and Ethiopia are currently among the 21 members of the World Heritage Committee.
Lake Turkana is not the only World Heritage Site which is threatened by dam construction. In a report to the Committee, the World Heritage Centre and the World Conservation Union IUCN proposed that ""all major dams affecting World Heritage properties (...) should undergo thorough environmental and social impact assessments in line with the international best practice principles, comply with the World Commission on Dams (WCD) guidelines regarding options assessment, public participation, environmental flows, compliance, and benefit sharing, and be submitted to the World Heritage Committee for review and consideration prior to granting of approval.""China and Ethiopia both have important World Heritage Sites, including the Summer Palace, the Great Panda sanctuaries of Sichuan, and the Lower Awash Valley where the remains of the famous Lucy were found within their borders. When they signed the World Heritage Convention, the two countries accepted an international legal responsibility to protect such sites around the world. With the decision of the World Heritage Committee, the Gibe III Dam is no longer a matter of debate between dam builders, affected communities and environmental organizations. The governments of Ethiopia and China now have a duty to act. "

Belgium ",EBRD paves slippery slope for private banks to invest in coal in the Balkans,,,TES 6 coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,Slovenia,"

EBRD claims
to `follow highest standards of corporate governance and sustainable
development` in its special report on climate change `The low carbon
transition`.
The
multinational development bank carries the responsibility to set an example for
both public and private investors.
The EBRD however, is providing funding to some
of the most outrageous and environmentally destructive projects in the European
coal sector. 
The
attitude in Europe towards this outdated and climate destructive natural
resource is represented well if you consider that the 26 EU member states are
all showing opposition to coal, with the exception, of Poland. An unacceptable attitude from the EU President!
The use of coal is an environmental and
political provocation as it has been acknowledged as one of the most carbon
heavy energy resource. Coal based energy generation is a slap on the face of
European climate initiatives and in dire opposition to the EU`s ambition to cut
emission and head towards a low carbon economy.
The carbon
and emission heavy energy projects outside of the EU borders are developed based
on a set of criteria that is not compatible with EU legislations. For instance the Stanari coal plant by the
Energy Finance Team in Bosnia,
shows lower efficiency rates that could not pass EU requirements therefore it
is creating a future challenge for Bosnia and Herzegovina when
negotiating its EU membership.
The low
efficiency rate will result in higher carbon emission in the country. This
phenomenon is carbon leakage and the investment provided by the EBRD or any
private banks is encouraging that.
The region
of the Western Balkans has great reserves of lignite which enables energy
planning to head down the questionable route of establishing more mines and
proposing more power plants.
Such
investments hold sky-high risks:
For instance the TES6 plant in Slovenia. EBRD has put its name to it in
spite of the mass outrage from local communities, environmental organizations and
the pending police investigation into the alleged corruption that is lingering
around the project. Find out more here: http://www.banktrack.org/show/dodgydeals/tes_6_coal_power_plant
BankTrack
and its European Anti-Coal Network works closely with civil society and
environmental organizations around Europe to bring the attention of investors
to the danger of providing finances to coal fired power plants and to the coal
industry.
In
particular commercial banks that are exposed to reputation risks are expected
to show sensible and sound investment strategies and to halt any investment
into coal fired power plant in Europe,
immediately.

Switzerland ",Swiss Banks and Human Rights:,Credit Suisse ,Switzerland,,,,"

Since 2010, the major
Swiss banks Credit Suisse and UBS have financed the world's most controversial
mining firm: Vedanta Resources. Vedanta earned the number two spot on a 2009
list of ""most environmentally and socially controversial multinational
companies"" by RepRisk, a service provider for reputation risk, specializing in
the financial sector. Vedanta took third place in 2010, right behind Transocean
and BP. The acceptance of Vedanta as a new client shows that Credit Suisse and
UBS disregard human rights in their business dealings.
The Berne
Declaration launched the Web site www.banksandhumanrights.ch in April
2010, documenting controversial financing by Credit Suisse and UBS, and
analyzing how the big banks deal with the topic of human rights. With new
background research on the financial linkages and an update of the 2010
position paper, the Web site has now been completely updated.
With the
acceptance of the ""Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights"" in June
2011, the Human Rights Council determined that corporations are not only
implicated by the direct causation of human rights violations, but also when
they come in contact with violations via their products and services. This
clearly includes the financing activities of banks, whether directly, via
granting of credit, or indirectly, via assistance in the placement of shares
and bonds. The UN Special Representative on Business and Human Rights, John
Ruggie, states unequivocally with his Guiding Principles that the financial
sector also has a responsibility to respect human rights.
The fulfilling
of this ""responsibility to respect human rights"" requires of the banks a human
rights policy, human rights due diligence, and transparency. Despite some
progress by Credit Suisse, the processes and transparency of both major Swiss
banks is clearly insufficient to fulfill the Guiding Principles of the UN
Special Representative.
""It is shocking
that Credit Suisse and UBS finance the scandalous Vedanta. What is crucial
regarding banks and human rights is not how the processes look on paper, but
rather that these processes are implemented in daily business practices so that
banks do not contribute to human rights violations in their core business,""
says Andreas Missbach, finance expert from the Berne Declaration.

Washington D.C. ",Controversial coal projects continue to be registered despite serious concerns over the methodology to be reviewed by CDM Executive Board,,,Sasan ultra mega coal power project (UMPP) ,energy plants - coal,India,"
As
 an United Nations panel of technical experts prepares to deliberate on 
the suspension of coal projects that, if approved, could lead to 
hundreds of millions of artificial carbon credits under the Clean 
Development Mechanisms (CDM), the CDM Executive Board registers another 
contested ""Ultra Mega"" coal project.
Days
 after the CDM Methodology Panel recommended that the CDM Executive 
Board suspend the super critical coal methodology (ACM0013), the Coastal
 Andhra project, a 3,960 ""Ultra Mega Power Project"" in Andhra Pradesh, 
India was registered in the CDM system, despite overwhelming evidence 
that the project would go forward without CDM support.
""This project never should have been registered, it is plainly not additional."" said Steven Herz, Senior Attorney with the Sierra Club's International Climate Program.
 ""This unfortunate decision may cause over 12.3 million tons of excess 
carbon emissions to be emitted, and could hand the owner an undeserved 
profit of about € 123 million (based on current CER prices).""
The
 company argued that, with CDM support, the project could use more 
efficient supercritical coal technology rather than subcritical 
technology, and that it should be awarded credits for the resulting 
emission reductions. However, the project is one of India's Ultra Mega 
Power Projects (UMPP), which are required to use supercritical technology. This refutes the company's claims that CDM funds are needed to build a plant using this technology.
""To say that this project required CDM revenues to go forward is patently absurd"" explains Anja Kollmuss of CDM Watch. ""Not only is the project required by the Indian Government to use 
supercritical technology, but they already secured all the necessary 
financing, bought the land, began construction, and ordered all of the 
critical components before they knew if they could receive CDM funds. 
CDM revenues will just be excess profit. It is very troubling that the 
CDM Executive Board let this project through.""
As
 the CDM Executive Board prepares to consider the CDM Methodology 
Panel's recommendations, this controversy is unlikely to fade. The 
registration of the Coastal Andhra project brings the total number of 
coal projects registered to five, representing roughly 68 million 
credits worth over 680 Million Euros. With another 31 projects in the 
pipeline, potentially generating hundreds of millions of artificial 
credits worth billions of Euros in windfall profits, there is an urgent 
need to suspend this methodology.
In the state of Andhra Pradesh, 63 coal power plants totaling 56 GW are proposed. These and other coal projects in India have not gone uncontested.
 
""In many areas locals have protested against proposed coal plants,"" says Dr. Babu Rao a former Indian government official turned anti-coal activist, ""unfortunately, we have had several reports of the police reacting violently against protesters, intimidating villagers, as they struggle to protect their livelihood and habitats."" 
At
 a time where CDM projects have come under increased scrutiny because of
 their potential human rights abuses, it seems especially problematic to
 register a project in a state that has violently suppressed civil 
dissent.
""CDM is supposed to promote sustainable development, and coal-based energy production is far from sustainable"" explains Alyssa Johl from the Center for International Environmental Law.  ""Coal-based
 power projects have serious negative impacts on the environment and 
human health that will impose real and significant long-term costs on 
governments and communities alike.  Local communities have good reason 
to be concerned.""

Paris ",France ready to finance the next Fukushima,,,Jaitapur nuclear power plant ,energy plants - nuclear,India,"
“While the Fukushima catastrophe is still 
ongoing, the French state brings its financial support to the building 
of a nuclear power plant on a seismic fault in a populated region of 
India, explains Sophia Majnoni, nuclear campaigner for Greenpeace France. The
 government persists in its archaic choice of nuclear, whatever the 
costs, even if it poses enormous risks to populations. This backward 
attitude has to stop. France needs to not only change its own energy 
model to get out of nuclear and enter in the modern age of energy 
savings and renewables, but must also allow emerging powers to develop 
peacefully, helping them to develop clean energies that are not from the
 1950s.” Jaitapur, a crazy project...Areva plans to build two 
EPR reactors in India in a region and a country that do not satisfy the 
security conditions of this type of installations at all. Not only is 
Jaitapur located in a zone where the seismic risk is elevated, but the 
Indian Nuclear Safety Authority is not independent, and many security 
flaws have been witnessed in the past few years on existing nuclear 
plants. India is also one of the only countries in the world that has not
 signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Moreover, the local population is strongly mobilised against this 
project. At the same time however, the repression of these 
demonstrations has been even stronger and more aggressive leaving one 
demonstrator shot dead in April 2011.  “Before it even started, this project had already led to serious human rights abuses”, adds Juliette Renaud, campaigner on financial actors’ accountability for Friends of the Earth France. “It
 has violated Indian and international regulations by denying to the civil society the access to the Environmental Impact Assessment and by 
proceeding with forced land acquisitions, without even consulting 
affected populations. The French government finds itself in front of a 
crucial choice: to continue to promote its nuclear exports whatever the costs, or favour 
populations’ security and avoid high social and environmental impacts by
 withdrawing its support to this dangerous nuclear project.”  … supported by French public fundsSince French 
nuclear is difficult to export, in recent years France took the habit of
 systematically delivering, through Coface -the institution delivering 
the French public guarantees-, a public insurance on EPR construction 
projects abroad (Olkiluoto, Taishan and now Jaitapur). This is why a 
letter has just been sent to French President Nicolas Sarkozy, asking France not to finance this project. Coming from more than thirty 
countries from all five continents, more than one hundred civil society 
organisations, including Friends of the Earth France and Greenpeace 
France, have united to write this letter. Press contacts:Axel Renaudin, Greenpeace France – +33 6 88 88 18 27Caroline Prak, Friends of the Earth France – +33 6 86 41 53 43 / +33 1 48 51 18 96

Kunming, China ","Chinese NGOs Rank the Country’s Major Financiers, Launch Sustainability Benchmarking of Chinese Commercials Banks",Bank of  ,China,,,,"

Green
Watershed, a Chinese environmental NGO and member of BankTrack, an
international network of NGOs that advance sustainability in the financial
sector, released an English-language report about the sustainability policies
and practices of major Chinese commercial banks.  Environmental Record of Chinese
Banks 2010 benchmarks 14 Chinese commercial banks, including
ICBC, China Construction Bank and Bank of China, which are currently among the
top ten most valuable banks in the world, according to the Financial Time's Global 500 ranking.  Additionally, the report assessed Bank of
Communications, China
Merchants Bank, CITIC Bank, Shanghai Pudong
Development Bank, China
Minsheng Bank, Industrial Bank, Huaxia Bank, Shenzhen Development Bank, Bank of
Beijing, Bank of Ningbo and Bank of Nanjing.  Cumulatively, these 14 banks
account for more than half the assets of all Chinese banks.
Key conclusions of the report include:
-          Overall, Chinese commercial banks disclosed information 
about their environmental performance more voluntarily than in years 
past; including both their lending for environmentally friendly projects
 and information about phasing out lending to energy inefficient or 
highly polluting industries.  However, the banks fell short in terms of 
adopting transparent policies and implementation measures, engaging with
 the public and embracing international standards.  
-          Among the best performers were China Merchants Bank, 
Industrial Bank, ICBC and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, which made 
strides towards integrating the central government's green credit 
policy, through the formulation of environmental policies and 
implementation of environmental measures, research on and practice of 
international environmental standards, internal environmental activities
 and outreach.  Among the worst performers were Bank of Nanjing, Bank of
 Ningbo, Huaxia Bank and Shenzhen Development Bank.
-          The report also notes that Chinese banks are financing 
controversial mining, oil & gas, agriculture and hydropower 
activities around the world.  The authors recommend that Chinese banks 
should, at minimum, apply domestic green credit policies to their 
overseas transactions if they are truly to become world-class financial 
institutions.
The report, which originally was released in Chinese in April 2011, 
assesses each bank based on indicators such as its environmental 
policies, implementation measures, lending reductions to 
energy-intensive and polluting sectors, lending to environmentally 
friendly projects, adoption of international standards, information 
disclosure and public engagement.  The authors used data from the banks'
 2009 CSR reports, publicly-available bank policies, questionnaires sent
 to the banks, and media coverage. Environmental Record of Chinese Banks 2010 is
 the second sustainability study of Chinese commercial banks led by 
Green Watershed; the first study, released in 2009, examined the banks' 
progress towards sustainability in 2008.
In addition to Green Watershed, eight Chinese environmental NGOs 
collaborated on the benchmarking project. Collaborating NGOs include 
Friends of Nature, Global Environmental Institute, Institute of Public 
and Environmental Affairs, Green Earth Volunteers, Civil Society Watch, 
China Development Brief, Chongqing League of Green Volunteers, and 
Sichuan Hengduan Mountains Research Institute.  SynTao Co. Ltd. provided

United States ",Recognizing Dams as a World Heritage Threat,,,Gibe III dam ,energy plants - dams,Ethiopia,"
 
The UNESCO World Heritage Committee just concluded its  35th session in Paris, and for the activists and experts who worked long and hard to protect many dam-threatened World Heritage Sites, the results were a mixed bag.
In early June of this year, 18 organizations and individuals sent a letter to World Heritage Committee members urging them to list a number of threatened sites on the List of World Heritage In Danger.
Here are some of the recent decisions:

The Río Plátano Biosphere Reserve in Honduras made it to the List of World Heritage in Danger due to poaching, pollution and plans for a series of dams on the Patuca River.
Thanks to the efforts of Friends of Lake Turkana and others, IUCN and UNESCO will send a monitoring mission to Lake Turkana Parks in Kenya to investigate the threats to lake levels from the 1,870 MW Gibe III Dam in Ethiopia upstream. While we were disappointed that neither Lake Turkana nor the Omo Valley were listed as in danger, we hope this mission will highlight the 
severe consequences of the dam on the survival of Lake Turkana and its 
people. 
There was shockingly little action around China's Three Parallel Rivers,
 whose Nu River  could lose its roaring rapids should a cascade of 
planned dams in Tibet and upper Yunnan be approved. Stay tuned for more 
information on our efforts to protect this mighty river.

 
Free flowing rivers are at the heart of many of these sites and the reason why they are so beautiful, healthy and vibrant. Natural flows help maintain groundwater levels, nutrient flows to 
downstream fields, and fish migrations. Free flowing rivers are often 
also the last refuge for many endangered aquatic species. A host of other World Heritage Sites are currently threatened by dam building planned  within and around their borders.  
The World Heritage Committee will publish further decisions on actions to take for these sites in the next couple of weeks. We 
hope that the Committee will commit to stronger actions to discourage 
dam-building impacts to our world's most treasured sites, and we will urge host country governments to step up their own protection measures.
We
 will update you on our efforts to continue fighting for the protection 
of Lake Turkana, Three Parallel Rivers, and other dam-threatened sites 
around the world. Stay tuned. "

Bangkok, Thailand ",Laos Steamrolls Neighbors in Xayaburi Dam Process,,,Xayaburi dam ,energy plants - dams,Laos,"
Laos appears to have defied its neighbors in a move to press ahead with the proposed Xayaburi Dam on the Mekong Mainstream,
 despite concerns raised by neighboring governments and regional civil 
society groups.  A letter   leaked to International Rivers, dated June 
8, 2011, reveals that the Lao Government has informed the Xayaburi 
project developer Ch. Karnchang that the Mekong River Commission's (MRC)
 regional decision-making process is now complete, presumably giving Ch.
 Karnchang the green light to proceed with the project.
The MRC 
itself, however, is yet to officially announce the regional process as 
complete. Previously, at a Special Joint Committee Meeting on April 19, the four member governments agreed to defer the decision on the project to a Ministerial level meeting,
 likely to take place in October or November 2011. At this Special Joint
 Committee meeting, whilst Laos proposed to proceed with the dam, 
Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam called for an extension to the 
decision-making process citing concerns about transboundary impacts and 
knowledge gaps requiring further study and consultation. Vietnam also 
recommended that the decision on the Xayaburi Dam and other proposed 
mainstream dams be deferred for a period of ten years.
The 
procedures of the MRC's regional process clearly state in Article 5.4.3 
that ‘The MRC  shall aim to arriving at an agreement on
 the proposed use and issue a decision that contains the agreed upon 
conditions.' ""By deciding unilaterally that the regional decision-making
 process is complete, the Government of Laos has committed an egregious 
breach of trust and has joined the ranks of rogue nations,"" said Ms. Ame
 Trandem, Mekong Campaigner with International Rivers.
The letter
 written by the Director-General of Laos' Ministry of Energy and Mines 
to the Xayaburi Power Company Limited    refers to a one-month study by 
the international consultancy group Pöyry. The letter states that in 
Pöyry's view the ""Prior Consultation of the Xayaburi Project has now 
been completed,"" and that the Lao government ""hereby confirm that any
 necessary step in relation to the 1995 Mekong Agreement has been duly 
taken.""
Conclusion of the PNPCA process is a prerequisite to the
 Xayaburi Dam developers signing a Power Purchase Agreement with the 
Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, which the company is now 
seeking.
""Laos has no entitlement to unilaterally declare the end 
of the PNPCA process at this stage,"" said Ms. Sor Rattanamanee Polkla, a
 Thai Lawyer from the Community Resource Center and member of the Mekong
 Legal Network. ""Chapter 2 of the 1995 Mekong Agreement makes it clear 
that the regional decision-making process is 'neither a right to veto 
the use nor unilateral right to use water by any riparian without taking
 into account other riparians' rights'. The three other lower Mekong 
countries asked for the project to be delayed for further study, 
including a trans-boundary Environmental Impact Assessment. Laos has an 
obligation under international law to both conduct such an EIA and 
negotiate in good faith under the Mekong Agreement before moving 
forward.""
On April 23, at a meeting in Phnom Penh, the Prime 
Ministers of Vietnam and Cambodia jointly expressed concern about the 
Xayaburi Dam's transboundary impacts to fisheries and agriculture. 
Subsequently, at the 18th ASEAN summit in Jakarta on 7 May 2011, the Lao
 Prime Minister agreed to a request by Vietnam's Prime Minister to 
temporarily suspend the Xayaburi Dam and commission a review of the 
project's documents by an international consultancy firm under the 
framework of the MRC.
Laos' Ministry of Energy and Mines had 
publicly confirmed that the study had been commissioned, yet no further 
details of the study nor the role of the MRC in this process was 
announced to the public. It now appears that the study was a cursory, 
one-month review of the PNPCA process and not a review of the 
environmental and social impacts of the project.   ""It's no 
surprise that the Pöyry Group was selected to review the Xayaburi Dam 
given their long history of dodgy deals that have allowed disastrous 
dams to proceed in the Mekong region,"" said Pianporn Deetes, Thailand 
Campaign Coordinator for International Rivers. ""But it's outrageous that
 Laos would stoop so low as to place its consultants' opinions above its
 neighbors concerns. The extensive scientific evidence that demonstrates
 the dam's severe social and environmental impacts should no longer be 
ignored, and the Xayaburi Dam should be cancelled.""

London ",FSA reveals British banks are failing to turn down corrupt funds,Barclays ,United Kingdom,,,,"

Global Witness welcomes today's
recognition by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) that the majority of
Britain's banks are failing to do enough to identify corrupt money from abroad
and that it is ‘likely that some banks are handling the proceeds of corruption'.
The campaigning NGO has repeatedly called for a new approach by the
regulator to identify and punish those banks that fail in their requirements to
identify their customers and their source of funds, particularly customers who
are senior officials of other countries, known in the industry as ‘politically
exposed persons' (PEPs).
‘Many of the failings identified by the FSA are the same as those it
found ten years ago after £1 billion stolen from Nigeria
by Sani Abacha came through London
banks. This reflects terribly on the FSA's softly-softly approach over the last
decade, and makes it very clear why Egypt is now seeking the
return of corrupt Mubarak funds from the UK.
Neither dictatorship nor corruption can occur without banks willing to help,'
said Anthea Lawson, head of the banks campaign at Global Witness.
‘For too long Britain's
banks have been happy to accept money stolen from developing countries by
corrupt rulers and their families. This review shows we need a radical new
approach from the banks, and a strong commitment from the FSA to ongoing
monitoring and punishment which acts as a proper deterrent; they cannot wait
another ten years then do a review of what's gone wrong,' said Lawson.
Last year Global Witness revealed that HSBC,
Barclays, Natwest, RBS and UBS had accepted millions of pounds for two Nigerian state governors who had been
accepting bribes. British aid to Nigeria is set to double by
2014; Global Witness believes the impact of this UK taxpayers' money is
undermined if British banks are facilitating corruption and the loss of Nigeria's
oil income.
Most recently, Barclays was revealed to have
allowed Teodorin Obiang, son of the
president of Equatorial Guinea,
to purchase 18 million Euros of art auctioned from the estate of the late Yves
St Laurent, through an Obiang-controlled company account held with the bank. Teodorin
earns a salary of about $6,000 a month as a minister in his father's government
yet is renowned for his luxurious tastes, including a $35m mansion in California.
The FSA's findings
include:
 

Three quarters of banks reviewed are not doing enough to establish
     the legitimacy of their customers' source of wealth - some in situations
     where they had adverse information about their customer's integrity;
At least two banks have been referred to
     enforcement with ‘serious weaknesses' in their systems
     and controls for managing high-risk customers, including PEPs;
A third of banks are failing to do enough to
     identify PEPs;
Half of banks are not reviewing their high risk
     and PEP relationships regularly; 
A third of banks dismissed serious allegations
     about their customers without adequate review;
A third of banks do not keep adequate records of
     their high-risk and PEP customers, impeding their ability to assess money
     laundering risk;
Some banks had inadequate safeguards to mitigate conflicts of
     interest on the part of their relationship managers;
Many relationship managers are rewarded primarily on the basis of
     profit and new business, regardless of their performance on anti-money
     laundering issues;
There is inadequate handling of the risks presented by
     correspondent banking relationships.

Notes:
In order to ensure that the
money held is clean, banks and regulators must apply three key principles:
1) If a bank cannot get its senior politician
customers to explain their wealth, then it should turn down the money. Senior officials should be able to explain how their assets were earned
legitimately, especially if there is a significant difference between their
official salary and their actual wealth. If they cannot explain there should be
a presumption that that their funds are the proceeds of corruption. This
concept of ""illicit enrichment"" is already recognised in international treaties
such as the United Nations and the Inter American conventions against corruption.
2) Banks and other investment managers should
disclose full details of state assets that they manage. In a dictatorship where one individual, or a small cabal, exercises
almost complete power over the state, there is a very thin dividing line between
state and personal investments. For example, it appears that Gaddafi has
significant personal control over the state funds invested in the Libyan
Investment Authority, which Global Witness recently revealed to be managed by
major international banks.
3) Such measures should be accompanied by
national registries that list the ultimate owner or controller of companies and
trusts. Corrupt politicians hide their identity, and
therefore their assets, behind complex webs of front companies and legal
structures. This can make it very difficult for banks, or law enforcement, to
find out who actually controls assets.

United States ",Mountaintop Removal Mining Raises Birth Defects,,,Mountain top removal coal mining ,mining - coal ,United States,"
In April I went to Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi's office in
 Washington DC. Nancy is my representative and I was there to talk about
 her duty to protect U.S. communities and waterways from toxic 
mountaintop removal mining pollution.
My friend Erica was in the room with me. Erica lives in the Kentucky 
mountains, and her community is not being protected - she illustrated 
this by recounting the horror she felt on discovering that the water 
that she had bathed her small child in for years contained arsenic 
levels many times above the ‘safe' level. It had been contaminated by 
surface coal mining.
A mountaintop removal mine above a community in Appalachia
Stories like these are shamefully too common in Appalachia. Yet, 
while they draw concerned expressions and sympathy from congressional 
staffers, too often they are dismissed as anecdotal and emotive.
Well, here's some hard science to back it up.
A new study in the upcoming Environmental Research Journal concludes that children born in Appalachian mountaintop removal 
counties are at increased risk of suffering birth defects - the leading 
cause of infant deaths. The study, by Michael Hendryx and Melissa Ahern,
 examines two million births between 1996 and 2003 and disturbingly 
concludes that children born near mountaintop removal mines have a 26% 
higher risk of suffering birth defects, compared to ones born in 
non-mining regions.
We already know that MTR is destroying jobs and communities. Now we have evidence that it's destroying human health.
Folks like Erica should be able to raise children without these threats. I'm sending this study direct to Pelosi's office. "

London ",Barclays account used by Dictator’s son to buy €18m of artwork with suspect funds,Barclays ,United Kingdom,,,,"
An account at Barclays bank was used by Teodorin Obiang, the son of 
the dictator of Equatorial Guinea, to buy €18m (£16m at current rates) 
of art from the estate of the late Yves Saint Laurent. 
Teodorin earns a salary of $6,799 (£4,200, €4,800) a month as a 
minister in his father's government, yet lives a playboy life, owning 
fast cars, private jets and expensive real estate. The Barclays account 
was in the name of his forestry company, Somagui Forestal and the French
 anti-money laundering authority, Tracfin, suspects the funds could have
 been illicitly earned.  
""Banks have a legal obligation to do checks on their customers. What 
due diligence did Barclays do to reassure itself that this money was not
 the proceeds of corruption?"" said Anthea Lawson, head of the banks 
campaign at Global Witness.
The latest information came to light in French police documents seen by Le Monde,
 revealing new evidence in the ‘biens mal acquis' or illicit enrichment 
case brought by the French anti-corruption groups Sherpa and 
Transparency International France. The case alleges that the 
presidential families of Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and Republic of Congo 
own assets in France that could not have been bought with their official
 salaries.
Global Witness and Sherpa believe that banking regulators in France 
and the UK should investigate Barclays' relationship with Teodorin 
Obiang. More broadly, regulators should overhaul their efforts to 
enforce banks' compliance with anti-money laundering laws, to ensure 
that the EU is not a safe haven for corrupt funds from poor countries.  
""It would be much more effective to prevent banks dealing with 
corrupt senior officials than to go through the difficult, expensive and
 lengthy process of trying to get the money back later on - as the 
Tunisians and Egyptians currently know all too well,"" said Maud 
Perdriel-Vaissière of Sherpa.
Teodorin's purchases at the February 2009 auction at Christie's 
France included a 16th-century bronze figure of Hermaphrodite by 
Gianfrancesco Susini for €744,716 (£653,634) and a gilded silver 
seventeenth century bull by Hans Valentin Laminit for almost €298,604 
(£262,078).
Teodorin's lifestyle is in stark contrast to that of the majority of 
the population of Equatorial Guinea. Oil wealth means GDP per capita is 
now at the level of European countries, yet according to the most recent
 statistics 77 percent of the population falls below the poverty line, 
35 percent die before the age of 40, and 58 percent lack access to safe 
water.
Barclays said it could not confirm or deny relationships with named 
individuals, and that as a regulated institution it must comply with 
legal anti-money laundering requirements. Its procedures include 
enhanced due diligence for high risk clients, it said in a statement.

Notes to editors
According to customs documents seen by Le Monde, in November
 2009 a shipment of 26 luxury cars and six motorbikes worth $12 million 
came through France from the U.S. for re-export to Equatorial Guinea. 
They included seven Ferraris, four Mercedes, five Bentleys, four 
Rolls-Royces, two Bugattis, an Aston Martin, a Porsche, a Lamborghini 
and a Maserati. In 2010 Teodorin added another Ferrari and Bugatti to 
his extensive fleet of cars at a cost of between €1.5 and 2 million. It 
is unclear which bank he used to buy the cars.
Questions about Teodorin's wealth have been raised since 2004, when a
 US Senate committee investigated the handling of Equatorial Guinea's 
oil funds by the American bank, Riggs. In 2006 Global Witness reported 
that Teodorin had bought a $35 million mansion in California, and in the
 same year he was reported to have said to a South African court that it
 was standard practice for government ministers in Equatorial Guinea to 
take a cut of government contracts. In 2009 Global Witness and Sherpa 
revealed that he had an account at Barclays in France, still open 
several years after the downfall of Riggs.

United States ",Coal export madness spreading to Oregon,,,Gateway Pacific coal export terminal ,transport and infrastructure,United States,"
Coal companies are bound and determined to get that dirty black rock out of the Powder River Basin and send it over to Asian markets to line their pockets.
While the EPA is pressing for stricter regulations on coal plants and the anti-coal movement stops new coal-fired power plants from being built and existing coal plants from having their lives extended, coal companies like Arch Coal, Ambre Energy and Peabody Energy are looking at Japan, China and India for new markets. These companies have already begun to seek permitting in the Washington ports of Bellingham and Longview and are facing stiff opposition.
In the southern part of the state along the Columbia River at the port of Longview, public pressure caused Millennium Bulk Logistics (a joint venture of Ambre Energy and Arch Coal) to blink and withdraw their permit application. While Ambre has stated they will re-submit once an environmental impact study is complete, the opposition to the port in Longview has become quite loud and effective at fighting the coal port initiative.
North of Seattle in Bellingham, WA, port logistical company SSA Marine and Peabody Energy have faced their own opposition. In the past few months, people in Bellingham have organized a number of large events around the coal export terminal at Cherry Point, a thousand-person rally which featured climate activist Bill McKibben and caused the Bellingham mayor Dan Pike to publicly oppose the terminal (the most notable politician to speak out against coal exports thus far.)
Now the coal companies are looking to mitigate the effective campaign work of the Longview and Bellingham communities, along with their national, regional and local allies, by spreading the ports south of Washington into Oregon.
Ambre has announced a lease at the port of Morrow (near Boardman, OR) along the Columbia River. Their goal at the Port of Morrow is to minimize the criticism they are getting from the increased rail traffic opening up coal terminals will bring. Their plan is to bring coal via rail from the Powder River Basin to the Port of Morrow, put it on river barges and float the coal down river to coal terminals for export to Asia.
The other Oregon port being talked about is the port of St. Helens. Also along the Columbia, this port is almost directly across the river from Longview. Columbia River Keeper, which has been a leader in fighting coal exports, has been pursuing more information on the Port of St. Helen's. Oregon's Democratic Gov. John Kitzhaber, elected with strong support of the environmental community, has stated that the coal exports in Oregon won't move forward without a vigorous public debate.
While coal companies keep playing every trick in the book, enviros are making no assumptions about King Coal's determination to export coal and will be fighting them with every means possible. "

Chile ",Legal Roadblock to Damming Patagonia,,,HidroAysén dam ,energy plants - dams,Chile,"
This morning saw a great success for the legal team working in Chile to stop the destructive HidroAysén project in Patagonia.
The Appelate Court in Puerto Montt accepted three recursos de protección - roughly equivalent to injunctions - which means that the project is on hold for up to three months until these issues are resolved.
These recursos are an important and welcome addition to the 
ongoing Chilean and international campaign to stop these unnecessary 
dams in the breathtaking corner of the world known as Patagonia.
The injunctions were filed against the approval of the HidroAysén EIA granted on May 9th. The issues to be addressed are:1. The lack of appropriate baseline information in the environmental impact study;2. The project doesn't own the water rights to operate under the conditions for which it was approved; and3. Since the beginning of the environmental review process, the government
 bodies tasked with environmental oversight signaled that they could not
 perform a full evaluation due to missing essential information, and 
therefore the project should have been cancelled.
The recursos were filed by many members of the Patagonia Sin Represas (PSR) movement: el Consejo de Defensa de la Patagonia (CDP), Ecosistemas, Greenpeace Chile, la Corporación Privada Para el Desarrollo de Aysén, la Corporación de Desarrollo de Aysén, la Asociación de Empleados Fiscales,
 Senator Antonio Horvath of Aysén, Senator Carlos Bianchi of Magallanes,
 Senator Guido Girardi of Santiago, Deputies Gabriel Silber, Enrique 
Accorsi and Patricio Vallespín, Mayor of Chile Chico Luperciano Muñoz, 
Mayor of Caleta Tortel Bernardo López, and many Chilean citizens.
The case was transferred from the Appellate Court of Coyhaique to the Court in Puerto Montt because the three permanent judges of the Coyhaique court were dismissed last week at the request of the PSR for conflict of interest, and thus the Court declared itself unqualified to hear the case.
The next step will be legal hearings during which the PSR will seek to overturn the resolution approving the EIA, and thus either require an entirely new environmental review process, or the outright cancellation of HidroAysén.
For
 now, we must all hope that HidroAysén is finally recognized for what it
 truly is - a corporate and political plot to exploit public resources 
for private gain using free water rights granted by the legendary 
dictator Pinochet. May the rule of law - and not the legacy of the Chicago Boys - prevail in Chile.

New Zealand ",Actions speak louder than words,,,,,,"
Today eleven activists appear in a Danish court facing serious charges for a  simple act of protest  in Copenhagen a year and a half ago, while Greenpeace International 
Executive Director Kumi Naidoo remains in a Greenlandic jail for his stand against Arctic oil drilling.Bearing
 witness and non-violent direct action are among the founding principles
 of Greenpeace. For 40 years, from pole to pole, on every continent and 
every ocean, Greenpeace has been bringing about change through these 
core values.Direct action can be spectacular and have immediate 
results - but bearing witness, while usually less dramatic, can have 
even more remarkable results.The power of bearing witness comes 
from the story it tells and the empowerment it brings to those who see 
the story, and then feel compelled to act themselves. As Ben 
Metcalfe, one of the original Greenpeace crew once said; Once you have 
witnessed an injustice, you cannot claim ignorance as a defence for 
inaction. You make an ethical choice: to act - or not.And there are times when inspiring other people to take action is by far the most powerful outcome that we can hope for.Today,
 as Kumi Naidoo remains in jail for bearing witness to the madness of 
Arctic oil drilling, eleven other Greenpeace activists appear in a 
Danish court. They face serious charges and possible jail sentences for a
 simple act of protest a year and half ago in Copenhagen.They 
unfurled a banner on the red carpet at a state banquet attended by over 
120 heads of state during the ill-fated Copenhagen climate talks. The 
message on the banner simply urged world leaders to take action to 
defend the climate: 'Politicians Talk - Leaders Act'.It was a 
simple act but the repercussions are still being felt. They witnessed 
one of the great political failures in modern history and, through their
 eyes, we were all made aware.Nora Christiansen, one of the 
eleven said: ""A year and a half after world leaders failed to take 
climate action in Copenhagen, the wrong people are still getting locked 
up. Kumi Naidoo is currently under arrest in Greenland for delivering 
the names of 50,000 people opposed to the Arctic destruction not only 
from oil exploration and oil spills, but from the melting of sea ice 
from the burning of yet more of the fossil fuels that got us into this 
climate change mess in the first place"".Kumi and the other 21 
people who took action here in the Arctic against Cairn Energy's oil rig
 in the past few weeks have held up the drilling for several days. But, 
perhaps more importantly, they have borne witness to the madness of oil 
drilling in the Arctic - something that would otherwise have gone all 
but unnoticed. The images of what they saw have been seen by millions.This
 is an issue which that draws together many of the causes Greenpeace has
 fought for in the past and continue to fight today, like the threat of 
toxic drilling sludge being dumped into a fragile ecosystem, or the very
 real risk of a Gulf of Mexico type spill in the harsh Arctic 
environment. Or the idea that retreating ice sheets are seen not as a 
grave warning, but as an opportunity to drill for more of the oil that 
caused the climate change problem in the first place. As Kumi 
said before he scaled the oil rig here in the Arctic, ""this is destined 
to become one of the defining environmental battles of our age"".It
 is a battle against the might of the fossil fuel industry and against 
shortsighted leadership and against our own addiction to oil. An impossible task? No it is not. Action inspires action. Indeed,
 with the support of millions, Greenpeace has been making the seemingly 
impossible happen for almost four decades -- an end to nuclear testing, 
protection of Antarctica from oil and gas exploration, a moratorium on 
commercial whaling, a ban on ocean dumping and a ban on trade in toxic 
waste, to name only a few - all seemed like impossible dreams, but as is
 often the case, once those changes happened they appeared inevitable.With
 this year's climate summit in Durban fast approaching, world leaders 
must repair the mistakes of Copenhagen, and live up to their 
responsibilities and promises by making a strong climate agreement in 
Durban. Durban is Kumi's hometown - the place he had to leave 
when he was forced underground as an anti-apartheid activist. He'll be 
there again this year telling world leaders what he witnessed here in 
the Arctic. As he watches those crucial talks unfold, he'll be bearing witness again.You are now aware. You can take action by sharing this video so that others too may become witness. "

Foz do Iguaçú, Brazil ",Tribes Dispute Greenwashing by Dam Builders,,,Belo Monte dam ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"
Indigenous people from Brazil's vast but shrinking Amazon region 
yesterday interrupted the Congress of the International Hydropower 
Association, claiming that the Belo Monte Dam was approved illegally by 
the Brazilian government, vowing to fight as long as it takes to stop 
the dam.  At the same event, environmental activists dismissed a new 
voluntary environmental tool as an effort by the dam industry to 
greenwash its practices.
Sheyla Juruna of the Juruna tribe, which 
would be directly impacted by the Belo Monte Dam as it reduces access to
 water on the Xingu River, surprised the director of Brazil's Eletrobras
 while he was giving a presentation in which he claimed that the 
Brazilian government received consent to build the dam from the region's
 most important indigenous leaders.  Ms. Juruna, who was joined by Mr. 
Patxon Metuktire, grandson of legendary chief Raoni of the Kayapó tribe,
 gave detailed accounts of the  reunions with indigenous leaders, in 
which government representatives set up photo opportunities and 
expressed the monetary compensation that the tribes would receive, while
 never receiving their final consent.  The two indigenous 
representatives also described to an audience of concerned industry 
figures and politicians from across the world how the Brazilian 
government recently approved a construction license for the dam, despite
 the Norte Energia consortium never having fulfilled the 40 social and 
environmental prerequisites mandated by Brazilian legislation to prepare
 the region to face Belo Monte's impacts.
Ms.
 Juruna, whose tribe would suffer directly from reduced access to water 
as 80% of the Xingu river is diverted into two reservoirs, stated that 
""Norte Energia's avoidance of its requisite social and environmental 
duties are representative of a larger problem in the hydropower 
industry.  Dam builders don't comply with their legal responsibilities, 
in order to avoid paying higher costs.  It's a shame that the industry 
pretends it has obtained consent from affected indigenous people, when 
there is glaring evidence that it has not.""  The statement echoed recent
 opinions by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and by 
Brazilian academic associations, which have requested a moratorium on 
the dam until the matter of indigenous consent is resolved.  The 
Brazilian government reacted harshly against the decision of the IACHR, 
threatening to remove its representative from the multi-lateral body.This
 week's protests coincided with the dam industry's official launch of 
the Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol, a voluntary score 
card for the dam industry to measure how well it complies with social 
and environmental sustainability guidelines.  However, environmental 
organization International Rivers claimed that the new guidelines are 
weak, in that they do not require developers to comply with national 
legislation nor with international policy standards.  The new score card
 promotes indigenous peoples' right to Free, Prior, and Informed 
Consent, but does not require hydropower developers to obtain it before 
beginning construction.
Zachary
 Hurwitz, International Rivers' Policy Coordinator, stated that ""there 
is a conflict of interest at the heart of the Hydropower Sustainability 
Assessment Protocol.  While it's necessary for industry to learn how to 
do sustainability in the right way, the Protocol substantially increases
 the risk that hydropower companies will be allowed to greenwash a 
project while they continue to cut corners behind closed doors.  The new
 guidelines essentially put the fox in charge of the hen house.""  The
 fracas at the conference also reopened older wounds felt by people who 
were displaced by the Itaipú Dam, currently Brazil's largest, during the
 1980s.  Representatives of the Guaraní tribe, who were displaced by the
 dam and currently live in run-down encampments on the shores of its 
reservoir, joined a group of Brazil's Movement of Dam-Affected People 
outside the Congress, in protest of what they claimed were structural 
human rights violations and a lack of transparency in the Brazilian dam 
industry.  According to Patxon Metuktire, ""Dam-affected people 
and civil society expect the dam industry to follow national law and 
international standards in each case, so that projects like Belo Monte 
and Itaipú, which have great social impacts, don't go forward.  We won't
 accept the dam industry's greenwashing.""-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

United States ",API’s circular argument on Keystone XL Pipeline wouldn’t pass your high school philosophy class,,,Keystone XL pipeline ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,United States,"
In my freshman logic course, now a long time ago, I learned about Petitio Principii, Circulus in Probando,
 also known as arguing in a circle. It's a basic fallacy popularly 
demonstrated in a formulation like this: Daniel always tells the truth. I
 know this because he told me so.
But of course Daniel might be lying, right?
I do not know the academic background of American Petroleum 
Institute's Marty Durbin, but it's very possible, given his recent 
comments, that he didn't take freshman logic. Or maybe he did and he's 
learned to apply his lessons in very clever ways. You be the judge.
My suspicion over Mr. Durbin's schooling comes from his comments regarding the expansion of the Keystone XL pipeline, which recently began carrying tar sands oil from Alberta to Oklahoma.
In response to regulatory action taken after two recent spills, Mr. 
Dubin said that the accidents actually prove the pipeline is safe and 
should be expanded. Comments on the expansion were due to Secretary of 
State Hillary Clinton yesterday.
Said Mr. Dubin in The Hill:

What we've seen over the last several weeks here is it's 
almost proven that we have an effective regulatory process in place... In 
some ways it actually supports the approval of the XL pipeline. They 
were able to detect the problems very quickly and take actions to stop 
the flow through the pipeline.

Of course if no oil were to spill that would also prove that the 
pipeline was safe. It's nice to be able to have it both ways, but it's 
not accurate.
Here is what is accurate: If the plan is accepted and the pipeline is
 expanded, stopping climate chaos will become even more difficult, maybe
 impossible. Just ask NASA's James Hansen, who wrote this to his 
scientific colleagues yesterday:

Easily available reserves of conventional oil and gas are
 enough to take atmospheric CO2 well above 400 ppm. However, if 
emissions from coal are phased out over the next few decades and if 
unconventional fossil fuels are left in the ground, it is conceivable to
 stabilize climate.
Phase out of emissions from coal is itself an enormous challenge. 
However, if the tar sands are thrown into the mix it is essentially game
 over. There is no practical way to capture the CO2 emitted while 
burning oil, which is used principally in vehicles.

Tar sands oil is the worst type of oil for the climate, producing 
three times the greenhouse gas emissions of conventionally produced oil 
because of the energy required to extract and process tar sands oil. No 
amount of rhetorical trickery will erase that fact. Expansion of the tar
 sands must be stopped. "

United States ",RAN translates banker-speak,,,Mountain top removal coal mining ,mining - coal ,United States,"
Earlier this year, thousands of RAN supporters wrote to Deutsche Bank
 boss Josef Achermenn to urge that his bank cease financing mountaintop 
removal coal mining in Appalachia. Deutsche Bank have given us their 
first response, however... it's a little dry. So I'm going to have a go at
 translating the ‘bankers-speak' into plain English.
Deutsche Bank's words are in italics, my ‘translations' are in bold.
Deutsche Bank regards the responsible treatment of the 
environment as an integral part of its corporate identity. Within the 
framework of our certified sustainability management system we take 
environmental, social and governance issues very seriously, and we 
therefore take your concerns equally seriously. We have carefully studied your letter and consulted internally with the relevant business units. 
Deutsche Bank thinks it is important to be environmentally-friendly, and so we have read and discussed your letter.
 
 Please note that we only do business with companies that fully comply with national and local laws and standards. In
 2010, we welcomed the US Environmental Protection Agency's decision to 
announce a set of actions to further clarify and strengthen 
environmental permitting requirements. We believe that these new 
requirements will help to reduce the environmental impacts of mining 
activities in the US. 
We only do business with companies that obey the law and we think that the EPA will make mining more eco-friendly. 
 
Being aware of the possible implications of our business 
activities, we have integrated environmental, social, and governance 
aspects in Deutsche Bank's risk management principles and guidelines. We use a systematic due diligence process, starting at the relevant 
business unit and involving internal control functions such as 
Compliance, Legal, Credit Risk Management, and Group Sustainability, to 
assess new clients as well as the engagement in potential business 
deals. If a case is especially complex and entails substantial risks, 
the case is escalated to senior management. 
Deutsche Bank has a process to examine the environmental, 
social and legal impacts of new clients and business deals. And, if we 
spot these risks, then it is up to senior management to judge whether / 
how we do business.
 
 Deutsche Bank only participates in financing, when the 
transaction complies with all the Bank's relevant internal standards and
 when it fulfils legal and regulatory requirements. We have 
also integrated a ""Green Filter"" into our Group Reputational Risk 
Management Program policy, in order to evaluate whether a transaction is
 in line with the Bank's objective to contribute towards a low carbon 
society. This approach is particularly relevant in carbon-intensive 
industries. 
Deutsche Bank has a goal to help society reduce carbon 
emissions and so we look at new clients and deals to see whether this 
helps us get to that goal.
 
 Business relationships with companies involved in 
potentially controversial environmental or social practices, are 
carefully considered and reviewed in depth and a company's 
environmental, social and governance risks will be assessed against 
external standards and internal requirements. If gaps are identified, 
Deutsche Bank will aim to work with the company to improve such 
practices or policies, or may indeed define conditions which the company
 must meet before the Bank will enter into a client relationship. 
When we spot a company who is not being as environmentally 
friendly as the law or as Deutsche Bank would like to see, we will try 
to work with them to improve. We might set a standard for the company to
 meet before we will do business with them.
 
 We are constantly working towards further enhancing our
 due diligence process and expertise, and we therefore appreciate your 
input. 
We would like our process to go further, thank you for your comments.
-
Whichever version you read, the bank avoids any mention of 
mountaintop removal (MTR). But if Deutsche Bank is true to its word, 
then they should not do business with any MTR company, as they all 
systematically break the law (see today's article by Ken Ward in the West Virginia Gazette that demonstrates legal compliance is getting worse, not better, in Kentucky).
What do you think of Deutsche Bank's response? "

Chile ",Brazil and Chile dam projects generate widespread protests,,,HidroAysén dam ,energy plants - dams,Chile,"
Read the Press Release about the controversial approval of Belo Monte Dam


Below
 is an interview with Aviva Imhof, Interim Executive Director of 
International Rivers. She was interviewed on Uprising Radio, a daily 
radio program hosted by Sonali Kolhatkar.  Aviva talks about the social 
struggles in Brazil and Chile that are taking place in reaction to large
 hydropower projects being built against the will of the people. Listen 
now! 
A
 Brazilian environmental agency yesterday gave final approval for the 
hotly contested Belo Monte hydroelectric dam project. Once completed, 
the Belo Monte dam will generate about 11% of Brazil's current energy 
needs. It will be the world's third largest dam at 3.75 miles long, and,
 if construction begins soon, will be completed in 2015. Belo Monte has 
been in the works for 30 years but has been stalled repeatedly by 
opposition. Indigenous groups and environmental and human rights 
activists maintain the project will cause catastrophic harm to the 
Amazon rain forest and tribes living within it.
Over
 the estimated 8 years of construction heavy machinery and thousands of 
workers will be introduced to sensitive forest areas. The Guardian 
reports that 30,000 indigenous people will be displaced by the dam, and 
62 miles of the Xingu river will go partially dry. Meanwhile in Chile, a
 proposed hydroelectric dam project there has been the target of 
protests for months. On May 21st in the nation's capitol, Santiago, 
20,000 Chileans rallied against the Hidro Aysen project. Comprised of 
five dams, the Hidro Aysen would flood an estimated 14,000 acres of 
farmland and forests. It would require a 1,500 mile transmission line 
corridor to be cut through rainforest and other protected lands.

Brazil ",Brazil Green Lights Controversial Amazon Dam,,,Belo Monte dam ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"
Brasília, Brazil - The Brazilian government has issued the full installation license allowing the Belo Monte Dam Complex to break ground on the Amazon's Xingu River despite egregious 
disregard for human rights and environmental legislation, the unwavering
 protests of civil society, condemnations by its Federal Public 
Prosecutor's Office (MPF) and the request for precautionary measures by 
the OAS Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR). The license 
was granted by Brazil's environmental agency IBAMA despite overwhelming 
evidence that the dam-building consortium Norte Energia (NESA) has 
failed to comply with dozens of social and environmental conditions 
required for an installation license.
The risky $17 billion Belo 
Monte Dam Complex will divert nearly the entire flow of the Xingu River 
along a 62-mile stretch. Its reservoirs will flood more than 120,000 
acres of rainforest and local settlements, displace more than 40,000 
people and generate vast quantities of methane - a greenhouse gas at 
least 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
The installation 
license will allow for NESA to open access roads, initiate forest 
clearing at dam construction sites encompassing some 2,118 acres, and 
begin construction on the complex immediately. It also instigates 
publically subsidized funding from Brazil's National Development Bank 
(BNDES) to finance 80 percent of the project's spiraling costs. The bank
 has come under increasing scrutiny from the Public Prosecutor's office 
and civil society due to alarming evidence that approval is based on 
political grounds, often downplaying problems of economic viability and 
compliance with social and environmental safeguards.
""This is a 
tragic day for the Amazon,"" said Atossa Soltani, Executive Director at 
Amazon Watch. ""By turning a blind eye toward the tragic consequences of 
this dam, President Dilma Rouseff is undermining the positive 
environmental and social advances Brazil has made in recent years and 
miring its image on the global stage just as it prepares to host the UN 
Rio+20 Earth Summit next year.""
The decision follows years of 
recently escalating intense local opposition and a string of government 
resignations in rejection of the parameters of the project, including 
IBAMA's president Abelardo Bayma, who allegedly resigned over the Belo 
Monte dam project license amidst intense political pressures from the 
Ministry of Mines and Energy and President Dilma Rousseff.
""The 
installation license for the Belo Monte Dam is in clear violation of the
 recent request by the IACHR to stop any construction until 
precautionary measures are met. Now the Brazilian government is in clear
 violation of human rights, especially those of indigenous peoples 
affected by the project. By moving forward with this project, Brazil has
 denounced the authority of the IACHR and has completely rejected 
international human rights treaties,"" said Astrid Puentes, Co-Director 
of the Inter-American Association for Environmental Defense (AIDA), one 
of the legal groups who filed the petition to the IACHR representing 
Xingu communities.
Fierce opposition by local inhabitants to Belo 
Monte has not wavered. ""Belo Monte's installation license is a sign of 
the government's deepening authoritarianism, as it continues to 
steamroll over environmental legislation and human rights,"" said Antônia
 Melo, a spokeswoman for the Xingu Alive Forever Movement (MXVPS). ""The 
government seeks to build this dam at any cost in order to benefit 
corporate interests at our expense. We will not cede an inch. This 
license is the entryway to a crime that we will prevent from being 
committed at any cost.""

Arctic ",Live Action: Climbers in survival pod stop Arctic oil rig,,,,,,"
In the freezing seas off Greenland, activists from the Greenpeace 
ship Esperanza are taking direct action against oil drilling in the 
Arctic.
Luke and Sigurd are now hanging from the underside of Cairn Energy's 
giant oil rig in our Arctic survival pod with enough food and water to 
stay there for for a good long time. Their action will prevent the rig 
starting its dangerous deep water drilling 100 miles west of the 
Greenland coast.
There will be live updates from the survival pod on the oil rig, and from the two Greenpeace ships near by.
Click to enlarge
 
Here's what's happened so far.
At 3am local time three climbers left the side of the Esperanza in 
inflatable speedboats. They slipped past the navy warship guarding the 
rig and climbed high into the superstructure of the 53,000 tonne Leiv 
Eiriksson oil rig.
They're now hanging from the underside of the rig 20-30 meters above 
the sea where they've set up camp in the survival pod hanging only a few
 metres from the huge drill-bit.
 If drilling is delayed for just a short time, Cairn could struggle 
to meet a tight deadline to complete the exploration before winter ice 
closes in, forcing it to abandon the search for another year.
Speaking by satellite phone from the survival pod 25 year old Luke said:
""Despite the extreme waters below, we're safe and secure. There's no 
way Cairn can drill for oil while we're hanging next to their drill-bit,
 and it's going to be extremely difficult for them to remove our 
survival pod. To drill for oil here would be dangerous insanity. We have
 to stop the Arctic oil rush.""
Greenpeace International has repeatedly asked Cairn for its emergency
 oil spill response plan but has been refused. That request was repeated
 to the rig by radio several times this week, but was ignored.  You can 
see a video of one of those calls here.
You can support the action by emailing Cairn energy to ask them for the oil spill recovery plan.
The world's oil giants are watching Cairn's rig with great interest. 
If it strikes oil this summer Exxon, Chevron and the other big oil 
companies (which have already bought up Greenland licenses) will begin 
drilling in the area and the Arctic oil rush will be on.
Even without an accident Cairn admits its drilling operation will 
result in at least 9,000 tonnes of toxic chemicals being discharged 
directly into the waters of the Davis Strait - including 180 tonnes of 
red-listed chemicals (more than all annual oil drilling operations in 
Norway and Denmark combined). The company admits that it would take 
decades before significant profits from oil exploration flow to 
Greenland, while Cairn's operations pose a grave threat to Greenland's 
fisheries, which represent 88% of the island's export economy.
The area where Cairn intends to drill is known as ‘Iceberg Alley'. 
The company intends to tow icebergs out of the rig's path or use water 
cannons to divert them to avoid a collision as the rig drills for oil. 
If the icebergs are too large the company has admitted it will need to 
move the rig itself. Last year a 260km2  ice island broke off the 
Petermann glacier north of Iceberg Alley. The region is famous for its 
narwhal population.

Strasbourg, Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels ","Small First Nations EU Tour has big Impact on Investors, Shareholders, and Governments",,,Canadian tar sands ,oil and gas,Canada,"
In May 2011, a small delegation of First Nations Peoples
brought to European institutions the reality of treaty rights, and the impacts
of living within the tar sands extraction zone. This reality represents an
important side of tar sands development that the Canadian Foreign Department
has not adequately addressed at home or abroad.
 Edmonton, AB - Lionel Lepine, member of Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation and Heather
Milton-Lightening of the Indigenous Environmental Network came to the EU with a
speciﬁc message, ""First Nations rights based on the treaties and recognized
within the Canadian Constitution are violated on a daily basis by the oil
industry and Canadian Government. This poses great risk on Tar Sands investment
as many First Nations communities face the brunt of the development impacts and
have not had due recourse by the Alberta and Canadian governments.""
 Meetings were organized with members of European
institutions (Parliament and Commission) to debate on the Fuel Quality
Directive (FQD) which could express the different carbon footprints of
oil-based fuel products entering the EU by assigning them (tar sands in
particular) a value that represents their (higher or lower) greenhouse gases
intensity. Everyday of the tour, the delegation would just miss the Canadian
Foreign Department, which has been quoted in the EU media as spending the
largest amount on EU lobbying in history on the Fuel Quality Directive.
 ""They needed to hear the personal effects and grave concerns
of our people. What they were told by the Canadians was all positive and they
(Canada) did NOT emphasize the fact that they are impacting the Indigenous
people of this continent. I had to explain how industry impacts our Traditional
way of life and emphasized the serious health issues of our community. One MEP
now, in fact, wants to actually come to Fort Chipewyan to visit! He wants to
see ﬁrsthand the impacts to the environment and of course the impact on us"",
recalls Lionel Lepine.
 In partnership with Friends of the Earth Europe, Netherlands
and France, meetings with investors had high interest in looking at the finance
sector as banks are beginning to create dialogue on Free Prior Informed
Consent, an internationally recognized legal right; that gives communities the
ability to make an informed choice and the right to say ""No"" to development.
  ""Our main
message to investors was Canadian constitutional law presents massive
liabilities to tar sands investors. Canada is legally bound by its own laws to
protect and uphold the trust relationship defined by legally-binding treaties
with First Nations which includes the protection of First Nations unique right
to hunt, fish and trap in their traditional lands. Canada has also failed to
mention to the international community that they are locked into the Security
and Prosperity Act that requires 63% of energy developed in Canada to be
exported to the US."" commented Heather Milton-Lightening, ""There is little
beneﬁt to the world to invest in Canadian tar sands development, not only for
these reasons but the cost of tar sands GHG contribution to global climate
change.""

Brussels ",Activists call for a ban on financial investments in producers of cluster munitions,,,,,,"
Worldwide, 166 private
  and public financial institutions continue to invest 39 billion USD in
  producers of cluster munitions, which like landmines, are banned under
  international law. Although some EU countries like Belgium,
  Ireland and Luxembourg
  are taking the lead in passing legislation that bans investment, many
  countries and financial institutions are lagging behind. These are some of
  the key findings in the report ""Worldwide Investments in Cluster Munitions; a
  shared responsibility"", issued today by IKV Pax Christi (the Netherlands) and Netwerk Vlaanderen (Belgium)
  , both members of the Cluster Munition Coalition (CMC). Survivors and
  activists are calling on the European Union and countries around the world to
  legislate against these explosive investments.  The full report, key findings and tools for campaigners can be found here  The European Union
  should take the lead. ""Cluster bombs are banned under international law by 108 countries. Leading
  banks in Europe like Deutsche Bank and the Royal Bank of Scotland should not be investing
  millions in producers of these illegal weapons"", said Roos Boer, report
  author. ""We are calling on EU member states and countries around the world to
  legislate against these explosive investments"", she added.   The report shows that since May 1, 2008, 166 financial institutions continue
  to invest US$ 39 billion in eight cluster munition producers included in the
  report. This includes:

Providing loans for
       at least US$1.5 billion
Providing investment
       banking services worth at least US$6.3 billion
Owning or managing shares
       and bonds for at least US$30.9 billion

 The report found that twenty six financial institutions from EU Member states
  are still investing over three billion USD (3,008.8 million USD) in cluster
  munitions producers. European Parliament resolutions in 2005, 2007 and 2008
  called upon member states to disinvest from cluster munitions but so far just
  3 countries have passed laws banning investments. More EU countries need to
  follow suit.   The report categorizes retail banks, investment banks, asset management
  companies and private and public pensions into a ""Hall of Shame""
  and a ""Hall of Fame"" based on their investment practices and
  policies and looks at legislative initiatives to prohibit investment in
  cluster munitions.  Hall of Shame in 2011 -
  Top 5 investors  in producers of cluster munitions in millions: 

Investment banking
       services: JP Morgan Chase (USA)
       US$639.4; Bank of America (USA) US$476.3; Goldman Sachs (USA) US$426.9;
       Citigroup (USA) US$347.3; Changjiang Securities (China) US$264.3 - 
       TOTAL US$2,154.2 million


Loan providers:
       Sberbank (Russia) US$320; Korea Development Bank (S-Korea) US$128.5;
       Bank of America (USA) US$100; Royal Bank of Scotland (UK) and US based
       SunTrust Bank, US Bank and Wells Fargo Bank, all at US$80; Mitsubishi
       UFJ Financial Group (Japan) US$75 - TOTAL US$943.5 million


Asset management: State Street
       (USA) US$5,515.6;
       Capital Group (USA) US$4,593; Temasek Holdings (Singapore) US$3,920.7;
       BlackRock (USA) US$1,816.3; MFS Investment Management (USA) US$1,469.8;
       TOTAL US$17,315.4 million

 Leading European banks listed in the Hall of Shame include the Royal Bank of
  Scotland (UK), Deutsche Bank (Germany),
  Société Générale (France)
  and Intesa Sanpaolo (Italy).  The Hall of Fame includes:  23 financial institutions with strong policies, including five government
  managed pension funds from Norway, Ireland, New Zealand and Sweden, ethical
  banks ASN Bank (the Netherlands), Banca Etica (Italy) and Triodos Bank (the
  Netherlands) and private financial institutions such as Storebrand Group
  (Norway), ATP (Denmark), ABP (the Netherlands) and Folksam (Sweden). These
  are all financial institutions from countries that have signed the Convention
  on Cluster Munitions (CCM). All but one are from EU member countries.   The runners-up category, which lists financial institutions that took steps
  to ban investments in cluster munitions producers but need to strengthen
  their disinvestment policy, shows a similar picture: 22 out of the 24
  financial institutions listed as a runner-up are from EU member countries.  « It is clear that when EU member states show leadership and legislate
  against investments in cluster bombs producers, that  it has a positive
  impact », said Esther Vandenbroucke, of Netwerk Vlaanderen and one of the
  report authors, ""There is clearly still too much money flowing from EU member
  states to producers of these deadly weapons.""  Campaigners around the world are using this report and taking action to push
  countries and financial institutions  to stop these explosive and deadly
  investments.   For further information please call:

 The full report will be available online on the following websites from 10:00
  am CET: www.ikvpaxchristi.nl/stopexplosiveinvestments www.netwerkvlaanderen.be/en/clustermunitions  KEY NOTES:  1.ON THE CONVENTION ON CLUSTER
  MUNITIONS On August 1st, 2010, the Convention on Cluster Munitions entered into force
  and became binding under international law. As of May 2011, 108 countries had
  signed the Convention and 57 had ratified. As of May 2011, 20/27 EU member
  countries had signed the convention.

The Convention bans
       the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of cluster munitions. The
       CMC and an increasing number of countries interpret the prohibition on
       assistance of the production/development of cluster munitions as
       described in Article 1(1)c as a ban on investments. 


Three EU states have
       adopted legislation to ban investments: Belgium,
       Ireland and Luxembourg.
       Several EU member states, like the UK,
       France, Germany, Italy
       and the Netherlands,
       are debating on whether disinvestment from these banned weapons should
       be banned by law or not.  That several financial institutions from
       these countries are listed in the Hall of Shame, should encourage these
       states to ban all investments by law.


The report shows
       that 128 /166 financial institutions investing in cluster munitions are
       from countries that have not yet joined the Convention on Cluster
       Munitions (including the China Russia, Singapore,
       South Korea, Taiwan and the US). The remaining 38
       financial institutions are from nine states which have joined the
       convention (Australia,
       Canada, France, Germany,
       Italy, Japan, Switzerland,
       the Netherlands and
       the United Kingdom)
       but that have not passed legislation that bans investment in producing
       companies. 

An overview of states that have signed and/or ratified the Convention:
  http://www.stopclustermunitions.org/treatystatus/.  2. ON THE EU

European Parliament
       resolutions in 2005, 2007 and 2008 all call for disinvestment from these
       weapons.


20 out of 27 EU
       member states have signed the Convention on Cluster Munitions. 7 EU
       states have not yet joined the Convention on Cluster Munitions.


15 of these 20 EU
       signatory states have already ratified the Convention. The remaining 5 did not ratify yet. 


3 out of the 4
       states worldwide that have legislation that bans investments in cluster
       munition producers are from the EU (Belgium,
       Ireland, Luxembourg).


44 of the 47
       financial institutions that are commended for their disinvestment policy
       in the report are from the EU.


26 financial
       institutions from EU member states are still investing in cluster
       munitions (from France,
       Germany, Italy, the Netherlands
       and the United
         Kingdom). The total investments by
       these 26 financial institutions from EU member states is 3 billion. 


The EU has shown
       good progress to ban investment but more needs to follow through. All EU
       states should adopt legislation to ban investments in cluster munitions
       producers.

 3. ON THE EP RESOLUTIONS The Resolution on a Mine-Free World on 7 July 2005 explicitly addresses the
  role of financial institutions. It ""calls on the EU and its Member States to
  prohibit through appropriate legislation financial institutions under their
  jurisdiction or control from investing directly or indirectly in companies
  involved in production, stockpiling or transfers of anti-personnel mines and
  other related controversial weapon systems such as cluster sub-munitions.""   In October 2007, this call was repeated in the European Parliament's
  Resolution Towards A Global Treaty To Ban All Cluster Munitions. This
  resolution calls for ""an immediate moratorium on using, investing in,
  stockpiling, producing, transferring or exporting cluster munitions,
  including air-dropped cluster munitions and sub-munitions delivered by
  missiles, rockets, and artillery projectiles, until a binding international
  treaty has been negotiated on the banning of the production, stockpiling,
  export and use of these weapons.""    In November 2008 the Resolution on the Convention on Cluster Munitions, was
  adopted. The resolution calls upon EU Member states to ""sign, ratify and
  implement the treaty at the earliest opportunity"", and calls on states ""not
  to use, invest in, stockpile, produce, transfer or export cluster munitions
  until the Convention on Cluster Munitions has entered into force;""   The most recent resolution on cluster munitions was adopted in July 2010 to
  welcome the Convention's entry into force on 1 August 2010 and called upon EU
  Member states to sign the Convention on Cluster Munitions ""as a matter of
  urgency before the end of 2010""  . To date, the following EU countries have not signed the Convention: Estonia, Finland,
  Greece, Latvia, Poland,
  Romania and Slovakia.  LIBYA UPDATE Cluster munitions still pose a serious threat to humanity. In mid- April this
  year, loyal Kadhaffi government troops fired cluster munitions in residential
  areas in the Libyan city of Misrata, putting civilians at great risk. The
  MAT-120 type cluster munitions used during the attack were produced in 2007
  by the Spanish company Instalaza SA. At the time of production and sale of
  these cluster munitions to Libya,
  several European banks had outstanding loans to Instalaza: Deutsche Bank (Germany), Barclays (UK)
  and 8 Spanish banks (Cajalón (Grupo Caja Rural), Caja España, Caja
  Mediterráneo, Bankinter, Ibercaja, Banco Popular, Sabadell and La Caixa.)  
 Thanks to the Spanish government banning cluster munitions in July 2008,
  Instalaza halted their production. However, production of cluster munitions
  still goes on in countries that have not signed up to the CCM yet.
  Governments should make sure no investments are made into those companies by
  not only forbidding production but also forbidding investments in producers
  of cluster munitions elsewhere. ________________________________  The research on financial investments and producers of cluster munitions was

Arctic ",Government documents: Arctic oil spill all but impossible to clear up,,,,,,"
We obtained a series of documents  today under a Freedom of Information request that show the 
government is saying privately what we've been saying publicly: an Arctic oil spill would be all but impossible to clear up.
In
 an email exchange, government officials told the energy secretary Chris
 Huhne: ""It is difficult to get assistance in case of pollution problems
 in such areas, and near impossible to make good damage caused.""
Another
 document reports that ""considerable challenges remain. The most 
significant of these is environmental - and the possibility of a second 
Gulf of Mexico type event ... The Arctic ecosystem is particularly vulnerable, and emergency responses would be slower and harder than in the Gulf of Mexico due to the area's remoteness and the difficulty of operating in sub-zero temperatures.""
It seems that everyone is agreed. Arctic drilling is an outrageous and unnecessary gamble that has to stop.

Potsdam ",UN committee deeply concerned about Ilisu dam,,,Ilisu dam ,energy plants - dams,Turkey,"
One of the major
        human rights committees of the United Nations voices its deep
        concern about the construction of the Ilisu dam as well as other
        dam projects in Turkey. With this, the committee reacts to
        reports by civil society organisations on numerous human rights
        violations connected to dam construction. 
For three weeks the
        committee for economic, social and cultural rights assessed the
        compliance of Turkey and four other countries with its
        obligations under the UN Social Covenant. In its final document,
        published on May 20, the committee urges the Turkish government
        to completely review its legislation on evictions, resettlement
        and compensation, and to take a human rights based approach into
        account in its infrastructure development projects, especially
        dams.
„The UN committee
        confirms that the Turkish government is obliged by international
        law to change its complete policy on resettlement and
        expropriation"", Ercan Ayboğa, international spokes person of the
        Initiative to Keep Hasankeyf Alive, gladly states. „Up to now,
        the affected population received token compensation and were
        settled in villages where they had neither income nor a future.
      This must change now!""
Besides the Ilisu
        dam, for which the governments of Germany, Austria and
        Switzerland granted public guarantees in 2007, but withdrew them
        two years later, the Turkish government plans to construct
        almost 2,000 dams and hydro-electric power plants within the
        next twelve years, which might affect up to two million people.
        „Taking a human rights based approach into account means that
        those affected can fully and effectively participate in the
        planning of projects, that their rights to an adequate standard
        of living, to health and access to their cultural goods are
        respected"", explains Heike Drillisch, coordinator of
        CounterCurrent, the Ilisu campaign in Germany. A report by
        CounterCurrent in cooperation with several initiatives in Turkey
        had induced the UN committee to reprehend Turkey in its
        concluding observations that these rights have been completely
        ignored by the Turkish government until now.
„This document of
        the United Nations once again shows the unavoidable and urgent
        need for establishing a new legal system. The current
        discussions regarding a new constitution must be used as an
        opportunity to draft provisions which recognize fundamental
        human rights and guarantee that ecosystems and communities can
        exist and flourish in Turkey as it had been the case in
        Hasankeyf for thousands of years"", Engin Yılmaz, General
        Director of the Turkish nature association Doğa Derneği, states.
„The right to a
        healthy environment is a fundamental human right. We will not
        cease to resist the complete destruction of our waters which the
        government currently pushes for"", confirms Ayşegül Özpınar, a
        representative of the Great March of Anatolia, a protest march
        arriving in Ankara today. For several weeks, activists and dam
        affected people from all parts of the country marched towards
        the capital to demonstrate against the destruction of nature in
        Anatolia.
Background:
Besides the
        Universal Declaration of Human Rights the Covenants on Civil and
        Political Rights as well as on Economic, Social and Cultural
        Rights belong to the central human rights instruments of the
        United Nations. The respective committees periodically assess
        states' compliance with their obligations under the covenants.
        Turkey has ratified the Social Covenant in 2003. In its 46th session from 2 - 20 Mai 2011 the committee questioned the
        governments of Turkey, Germany, Moldova, Russian Federation and
        Yemen.
The concluding
        observation and recommendation of the committee on economic,
        social and cultural rights regarding dams in Turkey reads as
        follows (cf. http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cescr/cescrs46.htm):
26.     The Committee is
      deeply concerned at the potential impact of the Ilisu dam under
      construction, as well as other dams, on the enjoyment of economic, social and
        cultural rights in the areas concerned, especially with regard
        to forced evictions, resettlements, displacement, and
        compensation of people affected as well as the environmental and
        cultural impacts of the construction of these dams. (art. 11, 12
        and 15) The Committee urges the State party to take account of a
        human-rights based approach in its infrastructure development
        projects, especially dams, and to undertake a complete review of
        its legislation and regulations on evictions, resettlement and
        compensation of the people affected by these construction
        projects, especially the Ilisu dam, in line with the Committee's
        general comment No. 7 on forced evictions (1997). 
The report
        ""Dam construction in Turkey and its impact on
          economic, cultural and social rights"" is available at http://www.gegenstroemung.org/drupal/sites/default/files/CESCR_Parallel%20report%20by%20CounterCurrent%20on%20Turkish%20dams_2011-03-15_0.pdf as well as http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cescr/cescrs46.htm.

France ",First Nation Tour brings truth to France on Tar Sands Development,,,Canadian tar sands ,oil and gas,Canada,"
A small delegation of First Nations members toured Strasbourg and Paris, France this week to meet with investors, French government and EU government with a specific message, ""Canada is a developed country with ""high"" human rights standards yet the tar sands development is slow genocide for First Nations living within the extraction zone,"" said Lionel Lepine, member of the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation. ""We are losing our culture, language and way of life which is protected by our treaty rights.""
The tour was organized by Friends of the Earth Europe, Friends of the Earth France and the Indigenous Environmental Network to address Tar Sands impacts on First Nations communities and the Fuel Quality Directive (FQD). The European Commission has yet to publish its proposal on the implementation of the greenhouse gas reduction target set in the Directive, and this legislation has been the focus of an aggressive lobby campaign by the Canadian Government. ""The Governments of Alberta and Canada are trying to convince the EU to ignore the higher emissions from tar sands. However, independent peer reviewed studies, US Government and European Commission studies show that synthetic crude derived from tar sands leads to 23% higher greenhouse gas emissions than conventional fuels used in Europe. There is an urgent need to stop all development of unconventional oil and gas reserves and more broadly to end our dependency on fossil fuels"" commented Juliette Renaud, Friends of the Earth France.
""We are calling for a higher standard on tar sands in the EU Fuel Quality Directive, including separate standards for tar sands open pit mining and in-situ mining."" said Heather Milton-Lightening of the Indigenous Environmental Network, ""We hope this forces other countries to stop developing, investing and importing Canadian tar sands oil.""
 Eriel Deranger, one of the First Nation delegation members who attended the Total Fina AGM in Paris this past week with a clear message for shareholders, ""Total should not be profiteering from development which is causing human rights violations in our traditional territories. We now face a lack of access to clean water, air and food in our homelands due to the massive pollution coming from the Canadian tar sands.""
Holly Rakotondralambo, from Madagascar, who was also part of this tour, concluded: ""We hope that the example of Canadian tar sands serves to draw the consequences and not to repeat the same disaster in other countries, especially in Africa where the governance is very poor. Communities in Madagascar are not prepared to face the destructive impacts of Total's project there and our government doesn't have the capacity to regulate the activities of these oil companies.""

India ",Protest mounts against earthquake prone nuke plant,HSBC ,United Kingdom,Jaitapur nuclear power plant ,energy plants - nuclear,India,"
Since its earliest stages, the proposed Nuclear Power Plant at 
Jaitapur has faced concerned opposition from local people who clearly 
recognised the inherent risks that the Indian government appeared to be 
ignoring. With the proposed site sitting directly on top of one of 
India's most seismically active zones, those with the most to lose saw 
clearly the danger they were being placed in and started the fight for 
their safety, their livelihoods and the future of their families.
Four years on and under the increasingly dark cloud of the Fukushima disaster opposition to the project has grown into an international campaign. 
Recognising the role of banks in financing such risky projects, last 
week more than sixty-two thousand people from all over the world joined 
the people of Jaitapur and wrote or called HSBC and BNP Paribas to demand a halt to the Jaitapur project.
Opposition to the project is based on a wide variety of issues - from
 mangoes and fish to the risk of a Fukushima-style disaster. But, all of
 these people are now united by a common goal: To stop the nuclear power
 plant being built and avoid the inevitable damage to a fragile 
ecosystem and the livelihoods that depend on it.
It hasn't been easy and our opponents are powerful and 
well-organised. As occurs so often in such situations, the Indian 
government has employed ruthless tactics, carrying out midnight arrests 
and forcing farmers off of their land. Yet, in the face an increasingly 
oppressive and brutal state, the people have stood their ground.
Greenpeace has supported the people of Jaitapur in their opposition 
to this project since the beginning. Recently, we have written to and 
met with some of the banks invited to finance the project, including BNP
 Paribas and HSBC. Throughout our discussions we informed them of the 
many problems associated with the project and urged them to withdraw 
their interests in it. So far, the two largest banks in Germany -  
Commerzbank and Deutschebank - have reached the same conclusions as us 
and steered away from Jaitapur.
As for the other banks, our concerns have been met with 
characteristic apathy and an almost automated referral to their flawed 
energy policies; policies whose chief function appear to be the 
avoidance of difficult questions and the maintenance of a thick 
greenwash over their otherwise tarnished images. It's difficult to know 
whether to laugh or cry when we are asked to ""Rest assured"" that the 
bank has ""a responsible policy for financing projects policy, which 
takes very seriously into account the social and environmental impacts 
of the projects we oversee.""
It is truly mind blowing that anyone who considers themselves to have
 a ""responsible policy"" could look at the Jaitapur nuclear project and 
see anything other than an ill-conceived and potentially catastrophic 
folly. Surely, the most ""responsible"" thing any organisation can do is 
to stay as far away from it as possible.
Public pressure is one of the most powerful things that will wake 
these banks up to the foolishness of the Jaitapur project and we would 
like to thank each one of you who added your voice to this protest - you
 truly helped make the Jaitapur nuclear plant a pressing international 
issue. From grassroots opposition to a well supported and publicised 
international campaign, Jaitapur is quickly becoming an issue  that the 
banks and the Indian government can no longer ignore. With your support 
we will keep up with this fight till the end and help India move away 
from inherently dangerous nuclear energy and to achieve its energy 
ambition through clean power.
Visit our website find our more about the dangerous of nuclear and what you can do to help stop it.
If you haven't let these banks know that you want them to stop funding nuclear energy, click here to send your email now. "

United States ",Mickey and Minnie Protest Disney Rainforest Destruction at Company HQ,,,Asia Pulp and Paper (APP) ,forestry - pulp and paper,Indonesia,"
Early this morning, two activists supporting Rainforest Action 
Network unfurled a 35 foot banner across The Walt Disney Company's 
two-story entrance arch that reads ""Disney: Destroying Indonesia's 
Rainforests."" Beneath them, Mickey and Minnie Mouse locked down to the 
main entrance gates to the company's Burbank headquarters-blockading 
Disney's executives from arriving to work through the main gates.
Please support these brave activists by taking action today. Tell Disney CEO Robert Iger that rainforest destruction is no fairy tale.  Indonesia's rainforests are some of the most biologically diverse in the
 world and they are being destroyed at a rate of 200,000 to 400,000 
acres per month. The pulp and paper industry is a primary cause of this 
reckless deforestation. Most of top U.S. publishers of children's books 
have taken strong steps to protect their supply chains from 
controversial Indonesian fiber, but Disney, the largest publisher of 
kids' books in the world, has refused to take action.
This bold action sends a loud message to Disney's top executives that
 it  is unacceptable for them to continue to drag their feet when they 
have  known for over a year that paper in Disney's children's books has 
been  proven to be connected to rainforest destruction and species 
extinction  in Indonesia.  Rainforest Action Network is asking The Walt Disney Company to eliminate
 its use of controversial Indonesian fiber and publicly sever all 
financial ties with APP and APRIL and their affiliates until key reforms
 are adopted. RAN is also asking Disney to implement a comprehensive 
company-wide paper policy and rigorous due diligence procedures that 
ensure it is rainforest safe.
To follow @RANActions and @TheRightPaper on Twitter for up-to-the-minute reports on today's action.
UPDATE: 9am pst.
A swarm of police officers and fire trucks arrived at the Disney 
headquarters this morning and arrested Mickey and Minnie Mouse, using 
bolt cutters to break through the chains attaching them to the entrance 
gates. Above, a fire truck raised its ladder to cut down the banner and 
arrest the two climbers attached to the two story arch.
The arrested activists were Christopher Toomey, Jennifer Binstock, 
Blake Hodges and Alexis Dickason-Soto, all residents of the Los Angeles 
area. The activists are in the custody of the Burbank Police and charges
 are pending.
Though the protest lasted just short of an hour, this was time enough
 for helicopter and satellite news trucks to arrive and record the 
colorful scene. "

United States ",Statement on Lao Government Decision to Delay Xayaburi Dam,,,Xayaburi dam ,energy plants - dams,Laos,"
International Rivers welcomes the recent decision by the Lao 
government to reconsider the proposed Xayaburi Dam on the Mekong River 
in northern Laos. The announcement was the result of a meeting between 
the Prime Ministers of Laos and Vietnam during last weekend's 18th ASEAN
 Summit.  Laos stated that it has temporarily suspended the project in 
order for an expert review to be completed.In light of this 
recent decision, International Rivers requests confirmation that 
construction on the Xayaburi Dam has stopped and that all building 
equipment has been cleared from the dam site. International 
Rivers believes that there is a clear scientific consensus against 
building the Xayaburi Dam. Scientific reports commissioned by the Mekong
 River Commission have revealed the irreversible and significant harm 
the Xayaburi Dam poses to the river's ecosystem and fisheries, placing 
the livelihoods and food security of millions of people at grave risk. 
Further reviews of the project by international experts have confirmed 
these risks and reiterated the fact that the dam's impacts on fisheries 
cannot be effectively mitigated and that the dam is likely to undermine 
regional development efforts. International Rivers believes that
 a healthy Mekong River is critical to ensuring sustainable economic 
growth, protecting food security and promoting regional peace and 
prosperity.  Given the magnitude of risk associated with Mekong 
mainstream dams, we recommend that regional governments work together to
 meet the region's energy needs through more sustainable energy options.
 We hope that this reconsideration is the first step towards a regional 
commitment to keep the Mekong mainstream free of dams.

Military tension between NATO and Russia. US diplomats manoeuvring in 
the wings. Aircraft carriers lurking and strike fighters changing hands.
Sound like something from a James Bond plot? Unfortunately it's not.
New Wikileaks releases today have shown the Arctic oil rush is not just a threat to the environment and our climate, but also to peace.
The documents show how deadly serious the scramble for Arctic resources has become.
And the terrible irony of it is that instead of seeing the melting of
 the Arctic ice cap as a spur to action on climate change, the leaders 
of the Arctic nations are instead investing in military hardware to 
fight for the oil beneath it. They're preparing to fight to extract the 
very fossil fuels that caused the melting in the first place. It's like 
putting out fire with gasoline.
Here are some of the main points from the leaked cables but stay tuned - there are more to come.
Increased military threats   
The Arctic oil rush risks instability and conflict. In one of the 
cables, US diplomats refer to ""the potential of increased military 
threats in the Arctic"".
Russian Ambassador to Nato is quoted as saying ""The twenty-first 
century will see a fight for resources, and Russia should not be 
defeated in this fight... Nato has sense where the wind comes from. It 
comes from the North.""
In April 2008, Russian Navy head and Admiral Vladimir Vysotsky said 
""While in the Arctic there is peace and stability, however, one cannot 
exclude that in the future there will be a redistribution of power, up 
to armed intervention.""
Russian flag planting is Putin party's idea
Russia is manoeuvring to claim ownership over huge swathes of the 
Arctic, as a senior Moscow source reveals that a Russian explorer's 
famous expedition to plant a flag on the seabed was ordered by Vladimir 
Putin's United Russia party.
Lobbying for the Greenlanders
The US is going to great lengths to cosy up to Greenland, amid 
concerns over Chinese influence. One cable said: ""Our intensified 
outreach to the Greenlanders will encourage them to resist any false 
choice between the United  States and Europe. It will also strengthen 
our relationship with Greenland vis-à-vis the Chinese, who have shown 
increasing interest in Greenland's natural resource.""
Another cable says ""with Greenlandic independence glinting on the 
horizon, the U.S. has a unique opportunity to shape the circumstances to
 which an independent nation may emerge. We have real security and 
growing economic interests in Greenland, for which existing mechanisms 
may no longer be sufficient. American commercial investments, our 
continuing strategic military presence, and new high-level scientific 
and political interest in Greenland argue for establishing a small and 
seasonal American Presence Post in Greenland's capital as soon as 
practicable.""
Tensions in Nato
Canadian leaders are uneasy over Nato plans to project military force
 in the Arctic in the face of perceived Russian aggression. Steven 
Harper, Canadian PM is quoted as saying that a Nato presence in the 
region would give non-Arctic members too much influence in an area where
 ""they don't belong"".
Justifying military spending
The Norwegian foreign minister thanked his Russian counterpart Lavrov
 ""for making it so much easier to justify the Joint Strike Fighter 
purchase to the Norwegian public, given Russia's regular military 
flights up and down Norway's coast.""
The ‘benefits' from global warming
Another cable states that ""behind Russia's (Arctic) policy are two 
potential benefits accruing from global warming: the prospect for an 
(even-seasonally) ice-free shipping route from Europe to Asia, and the 
estimated oil and gas wealth hidden beneath the Arctic sea floor.""
Stay out and miss out
Danish foreign minister Moeller is reported saying to US diplomats 
that ""if you stay out""  ""then the rest of 
us will have more to carve up in the Arctic.""
They go on to report that ""Moeller also mused that the new shipping 
routes  and natural resource discoveries would
 eventually place the region at the centre of world politics""

India ",Banking on the next Fukushima,,,Jaitapur nuclear power plant ,energy plants - nuclear,India,"
Two months after the devastating earthquake and tsunami struck Japan our
 thoughts are with those who have lost loved ones, those who face an 
uncertain future and those who are still unable to return home because 
of the deadly contamination from the still leaking and still precarious 
nuclear complex at Fukushima. The ongoing Fukushima nuclear 
catastrophe stands as a stark warning to those who live in the shadow of
 other nuclear reactors around the world. It stands also as a reminder 
of the inherent risk of nuclear power: a technology so complex and so 
dangerous that it will always be prone to the impact of natural 
disaster, technical failure and human error. Nuclear power is a 
technology that comes complete with its own disaster scale: the 
International Nuclear Events Scale or INES. Fukushima having suffered 
the twin onslaught of earthquake and tsunami registered seven on that 
scale, the highest possible, yet it is not the worst case scenario. It 
can't be. There is still much more radioactivity held inside the wrecked
 reactors than has been leaked into the environment. There is still no 
guarantee that the reactors have been brought under control. The future 
for those living in the area remains fraught with danger, uncertainty 
and risk.  One thing is certain, though! No one would build a 
reactor in a high risk earthquake zone on a coast now. Not after 
Fukushima. Would they? No one would take the risk? Regulators 
would not approve it. Citizens would fiercely oppose it. Banks and 
markets would not be prepared to take the risk; they would not be 
prepared to pay for it. Would they? Apparently, yes! Two of the world's 
biggest banks, HSBC and BNP Paribas, are doing just that, they are 
involved in funding a massive nuclear development at Jaitapur on India's
 earthquake prone coast in Maharastra State. If completed according to 
plan, it will be the world's biggest nuclear power facility. Long before the Fukushima disaster, local people expressed their 
opposition, they have protested the construction and pointed out the 
inherent dangers and technical threats posed by the planned French 
European Pressurised Reactors. They pointed out that nowhere in the 
world has the problem of how to isolate deadly nuclear waste from the 
environment been solved. Jaitapur is no exception - there is no plan, 
period. Nor is there any money being set aside to pay for radioactive 
waste management. Thousands of people have been unjustly arrested in 
protest. More than 2,400 families will lose their livelihoods if the 
plans continue, yet only 154 have so far accepted compensation. Despite this and in the face of Fukushima the Indian government is 
determined to continue, to let the French company Areva build the 
reactors. It will not listen to reason nor pay attention to the reality 
of earthquakes in the region:  in the last two decades alone it has 
suffered three earthquakes above 5 points on the Richter scale. In 1993 
the region suffered a quake measuring 6.3 which left some 9,000 people 
dead. I have witnessed first hand the legacy of the nuclear 
industry. Last month I travelled to Chernobyl and met with local people 
who - 25 years later - still live with that nuclear disaster every day. I
 have had the honour of standing alongside the people of the Wendland in
 Germany who continue to lead a mass movement against a planned nuclear 
waste storage site that threatens their livelihoods and homes. And along
 with the rest of the world I have witnessed the most extreme cost of 
nuclear energy - the disaster at Fukushima and the heart-wrenching 
consequences for the people affected.  Today, I have written to the heads of BNP Paribas and HSBC reminding them of the need to act responsibly and reminding them of the
 reality surrounding these already questionable nuclear investments. I 
am urging people everywhere to take a stand against future Fukushima's 
and join me in warning these banks against the risks of investing in nuclear power. Instead we need banks like HSBC and BNP Paribas to invest in clean and 
safe renewable energy sources rather than bank on the next Fukushima. No
 money, no reactors, no danger.

Coyhaique, Chile ","Divisive dams approved in Patagonia, Chile",,,HidroAysén dam ,energy plants - dams,Chile,"
 A five-dam hydroelectric scheme that locals 
fear will destroy the character of one of Chile's most important wild 
regions was approved today by the Aysén Environmental Review Commission 
with a vote of 11 in favor and one opposed. Critics say the HidroAysén 
approval process has been marred by a flawed Environmental Impact 
Assessment (EIA), and serious conflicts of interest on the part of 
Commission members.   The project has been the target of a local and international campaign 
that for 5 years has been fighting to keep Patagonia's rivers free of 
dams. A recent poll found that over 61% of Chileans are against the 
project.   Patricio Rodrigo, Executive Secretary of the Counsel in Defense of 
Patagonia, says that Chileans will not give up. ""We are outraged that 
the regional environmental review commission has approved this 
destructive and illegal project against the will of the majority of 
Chileans. We are calling on President Piñera to overturn this decision 
and protect Patagonia.""  On Friday, conflict of interest charges were filed against members of 
the Environmental Review Commission, including regional Governor Pilar 
Cuevas and other representatives. Late this morning, the charges against
 the representatives were accepted, but an injunction on today's vote 
was not granted. Several commission members had already recused 
themselves from the vote due to conflicts of interest, including the 
regional housing representative, regional environmental representative, 
regional energy minister, and the mining representative.   Country-wide protests this afternoon and on April 26 confirm that the 
campaign for a Patagonia Sin Represas is gaining momentum, despite a 
multimillion dollar scare tactic campaign by HidroAysén this year.   Whether or not President Piñera overturns the HidroAysén dams approval, 
the fight to stop this project is far from over. The next phase is the 
Environmental Impact Assessment for the $3.8 billion, 2,300-km-long 
transmission lines needed to export the electricity from Patagonia to 
Santiago. The EIA process for the lines will likely prove to be even 
more difficult, as they would affect thousands of Chileans and require 
the world's longest clearcut through virgin rainforest, protected areas,
 national parks, and a geologically risky region strewn with active 
volcanoes and afflicted by earthquakes.   ""The HidroAysén dams are a risky investment for Chile and would threaten
 a region of global significance,"" said Berklee Lowrey-Evans, Latin 
America Program Associate at International Rivers. ""Numerous studies 
have shown that Chile can sustainably and safely meet its energy needs 
through increased investments in non-conventional renewable energy and 
energy efficiency, with less environmental, social and economic costs 
than HidroAysén.""   The HidroAysén project would include five dams - three on the Pascua 
River and two on the Baker River - that would flood at least 5,600 
hectares of globally rare forest ecosystems, river valleys and farmlands
 in the Aysén region of southern Chile, including a portion of the 
Laguna San Rafael National Park. With the dams' price tag rising - they 
are now expected to cost approximately US$3.2 billion - the total cost 
including transmission lines is estimated to be $7 billion. The project 
is being developed by Enel of Italy and Colbún of Chile. Financing is 
expected to come mainly from private investment banks in Chile, the US 
and Europe. "

Russia ",Moscow regional police authority urged to resign due to arbitrariness in Khimki,,,St. Petersburg PPP toll motorway- Moscow ,transport and infrastructure,Russian Federation,"
Instead of carrying out their duties of law enforcement, Khimki's 
police are acting in a lawless way - detaining and beating legitimate 
defenders of the Khimki forest. Whereas a range of crimes, murder and attempted murder to beatings and 
robberies committed against members of the Khimki forest defenders 
movement still remain uninvestigated for several years by now.
The urban district of Khimki has turned into an area in which civil 
society activists have to in fear every day for life, health and freedom
 as well as the safety of their children and beloved ones. Instead of 
protecting civil society activists and their families from crimes, 
police prevents them to follow their legitimate civil right.
On the 8th of May 2011, a broad coalition of members of the Khimki 
forest protection movement, including representatives of resident groups
 of Moscow as well as leading Russian non-governmental environmental 
organizations, gathered at the station of Khimki to walk through the 
forest, where illegal logging has been carried out the day before. The 
Constitution of the Russian Federation guarantees in article 31 the 
right for peaceful gatherings to citizens. The forest defenders didn't 
commit any specific activities that need special permissions according 
to federal law № 54-FZ of June 19, 2004, so there was was no violation 
of legislation by the attendees. Suddenly and unexpectedly, the attendees were attacked by riot police, 
who detained 20 person in a rudely and violate manner with an 
unreasonable use of force. Two hours later, the detainees managed to 
connect with people who escaped detention and reported violate and 
arbitrary treatment by the police, including denial of lawyers' access.
With such practises, the police try to suppress resistance of civil 
society activists opposing the illegal construction of the toll motorway
 Moscow - St. Petersburg through the Khimki forest. The road 
construction through the forest is yet another example of the so-called 
„legal nihilism"" in Russia, as current legislation does not allow the 
road construction to pass through the forest: According the Federal Law №
 172-FZ of December 21, 2004 on the transfer of land use categories, 
conversion of forest in a forest protection category (including forest 
parks, the category which the Khimki forest belong to) can only be 
permitted in the case there is no possible alternative location for 
objects of significant state importance. Since there are 11 possible 
alternatives for the road construction, including 2 officially 
considered ones, the chosen alternative, demanding conversion of forest 
in a protection category, was obviously approved against the law. The decision to build a road through the Khimki forest illustrates that 
when it comes to the interests of powerful financial and industrial 
stakeholders or people with special administrative capacity, Russian 
laws for the protection of civil society's' rights are not implemented. 
The main co-owners of the concession company that plans to build the 
road through the Khimki forest are French multinational Vinci group and 
the Russian businessman Arkady Rotenberg. The construction of the toll motorway through Khimki forest has become a
 symbol of corruption, lawlessness and bad governance on one hand, with 
insecurity and disempowerment of civil society on the other. This 
construction project undermines the legal basis for the existence of our
 state, drowns the remaining trust of the dedicated part of society in 
governmental institutions and splits society.
Therefore, the coalition ""For the forest near Moscow"" urges the 
President of the Russian Federation to fulfil the responsibilities 
entrusted to him by the Constitution of the Russian Federation, to 
protect civil society activists in the urban district of Khimki, against
 arbitrariness of the authorities and the police. We require:

The dismissal of the leadership of the Central Department of 
Internal Affairs (МВД) of the Moscow region due to its inability to 
enforce and protect the rights, freedom and security of Russian citizens
 in its territory, and to reconsider the conformity of service of the 
Minister of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, R.G.Nurgalieva.
The investigation of crimes committed in the urban district of 
Khimki vs. civil society activists opposed to corruption and illegal 
destruction of forests and green spaces, and the punishment of the 
perpetrators.
To immediately cease all works associated with the construction of 
the highway Moscow - St. Petersburg and to execute a professional and 
transparent investigation on the reasons for the chosen line through the
 central part of the Khimki forest while possible alternative options 
would allow sustaining the protected forest.

Bangladesh ",Big coal emergency in Bangladesh worsens: Violent crackdown on villagers peacefully opposing coal mine,,,Phulbari coal mine ,mining - coal ,Bangladesh,"
Phulbari,
Bangladesh - May 5th,
2011 - On the afternoon of May 5th,
a peaceful anti-coal demonstration by local villagers in Bangladesh
suddenly turned bloody.  The resort to violence is the latest in a
series of events that have made the proposed Phulbari
Coal Project,
along with nearby mining in Barapukuria, one of the most fiercely
contested coal projects in the world. The United States Ambassador
has also been implicated in a recent WikiLeaks cable, which shows the
Obama administration exerting covert political pressure to push the
project forward despite a six-year fight to halt it and recurring
violence against people protesting the mine.
""At
about 3pm today, as people gathered in Barapukuria, some hooligans
backed by the minister attacked the peaceful demonstration, including
women and children,"" reported Professor Anu Muhammad of
Jahangirnagar University, who serves as Secretary of the nation-wide
people's organization that is leading the movement against the
Phulbari Coal Project, the National Committee for the Protection of
Oil, Gas & Minerals (http://www.protectresourcesbd.org).
""Many
were injured, including one National Committee leader, SMA Khaleque,
who is now in the hospital in serious condition.  Both his hands are
broken by the criminals. But people continue to speak out and the
protests are continuing,"" added Muhammad.  Protestors have vowed to
remain in place and continue a blockade of key road and railway lines
in the region until 10 a.m. on May 6th.
The
proposed Phulbari Coal Project in northwest Bangladesh would destroy
14,500 acres of the nation's most fertile farmland to make way for
an immense open-pit coalmine.  The project would extract 572 million
tons of coal over a lifespan of at least 36 years, and construct at
least one 500 MW coal-fired power plant that would emit greenhouse
gases for decades to come.  In addition, a 2008 Expert Committee
Report commissioned by the Bangladeshi government found that nearly
130,000 (129,417) people would be forcibly evicted and displaced from
their homes and lands, most of whom are indigenous and farming
families with multi-generational ties to the land.
The
project is currently stalled and awaiting government approval, which
has been delayed while the government considers a national ban on
open-bit coal mining.  The government is expected to release a new
national energy policy, including a decision on open-pit mining, by
June of this year.  The grassroots movement formed in opposition to
the Phulbari Coal project has become increasingly linked to
community-led campaigns in the nearby Barapukuria region, where a
national ""pilot project"" to open-pit mining in Bangladesh is
being proposed.
The
May 5th protest follows a wave of recent mobilizations in Bangladesh,
including a seven-day ""Long
March that began on October 24th,
2010, when tens of thousands of Bangladeshi citizens united to march
250 miles from the capital city of Dhaka to the Phulbari region in
northwest Bangladesh.
This
week's violence is not the first time that efforts to push forward
the coal mine have resulted in bloodshed: In August of 2006,
paramilitary forces opened fire on thousands of peaceful
demonstrators opposing the mine, killing three people, including a
14-year-old boy, and injuring more then 200.
During
the most recent protests, Bangladesh's notorious Rapid Action
Battalion (RAB) has been deployed to intimidate protesters and guard
the office of the project's UK-based investor, Global Coal
Management. Denounced
by international human rights organizations as a government death
squad, RAB is feared for it routine use of torture and the alarming
number of extra-judicial killings that occur in RAB custody.
WikiLeaks
cables released in December 2010 exposed that the
US Ambassador to Bangladesh, James Moriarty, has been actively
engaged in promoting the Phulbari Coal Project. In the cable, sent in
July of 2009, Moriarty
notes that the mine is ""politically sensitive in the light of
the impoverished, historically oppressed tribal community residing on
the land.""  Nonetheless, Moriarty
urged the Prime Minister's energy advisor to authorize the project,
saying that ""open-pit mining seemed the best way forward"" and
citing 60% US investment in the company behind the project, Global
Goal Management (formerly known as Asia Energy).
Global
Coal Management Resources plc (GCM), a UK-based company, and their
wholly owned subsidiary Asia Energy Corporation (Bangladesh) Pty
Limited, control the Phulbari Coal Project, their sole asset.   Over
53% of all GCM shares are owned by four companies that make up the
Luxor Capital Group, all of which are owned by Christian Leone, a US
citizen who also operates a New-York-based hedge fund in his own
name.
Commenting
on Moriarty's interference, Professor Anu Muhammad said ""We have
seen for decades that the US Embassy works as lobby staff for
corporations-and not for the people.""
""How
can the mining company, Global Coal Management-and the US
government-continue to ignore this opposition?"" questioned Joanna
Levitt, Executive Director of the San Francisco-based human rights
group International
Accountability Project (IAP) which has been following the case since 2008.  ""The outcry in
Phulbari has grown into possibly the largest anti-coal movement in
the world, and yet the Obama administration continues to aggressively
push forward this project, without any regard for democratic process
in Bangladesh,"" Levitt added.
""If
a mine like Phulbari goes ahead,"" said Professor Mohammad from his
home in Phulbari, ""it is not just our local people here who lose
when our homes and lands are destroyed.   All people lose, US people
too, because environment is a global issue.""
IAP
Senior Research Fellow Kate Hoshour commented, ""Let's not forget
the global warming impacts.   The Phulbari project would dramatically
expand coal-based energy production, the worst offender in terms of
greenhouse gas emissions and dirty energy, and it is being proposed
for a country that is among the most vulnerable in the world to the
impacts of climate change.""

Russia ",French construction firm Vinci involved in scandalous destruction of Russian forest,,,St. Petersburg PPP toll motorway- Moscow ,transport and infrastructure,Russian Federation,"
Protected Russian forest is being destroyed in order to build a
 new toll highway between Moscow and St. Petersburg. The campaign to 
save this forest has already suffered through outrageous acts against 
local residents and activists - including beatings, arson, and murder. That this is all happening during the UN Year of the Forest only adds another layer of tragedy to the situation, and French construction conglomerate Vinci doesn't appear ashamed of its involvement in the destruction of this protected forest, the apparent disregard for its own environmental policy, nor the violation of its commitment to the UN Global Compact on human rights.
Today Vinci shareholders gathered in Paris for their annual assembly -
 where they were greeted with a message to stop the destruction of 
Khimki Forest delivered by Evgenia Chirikova, leader of the Movement to Defend Khimki Forest, and a flashmob of her fellow activists.
The decision to build a highway through the Khimki Forest has 
effectively violated the most important conservation provision in 
Russia. According to Russian law, forest in a protection category can 
only be cut down if there is no possible alternative location for the 
object being built. In this case there is not just one alternative 
location - but 11 alternative construction options for the highway. Judicial proceedings have failed to identify the chosen construction plan as illegal, despite the clear violation.
The Khimki Forest story goes far beyond the destruction of protected 
forest. It contains a vicious cocktail of scandal, as defending the 
commercial interests linked to the highway project has resulted in 
horrendous acts against activists. Last summer huge protests in Moscow 
caused Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to halt construction, but the 
powerful interests involved in the project managed to get the highway 
back on track.
Bulldozers started their work plowing down the Khimki Forest this month. I was there and wrote an eyewitness account, with more photos from my Russian colleagues.
It is not too late to stop the destruction, and not too late to 
demand an end to the violations of civil and human rights. You can stand
 together with the Russian activists who are putting their lives and 
freedom at risk by adding your name to this petition backed by a coalition of NGOs.
 The petition asks Vinci to end its involvement in the project until an 
alternative route is chosen - one that doesn't involve further 
destruction in Khimki Forest.

Madrid, Spain ",Cluster bombs manufactured in Spain in 2007 and used by Gaddafi to bomb Misrata were financed by Spanish banks,Banco Santander ,Spain,,,,"
SETEM also reveals that 14 Spanish banks,
among them BBVA, Santander and Bankia, invested almost 2 billion € in 19 major
manufacturers of controversial arms that cause thousands of civilian deaths
around the world. Among those highlighted are chemical and biological weapons,
cluster bombs and anti-personnel mines.
SETEM has confirmed this morning in the presentation of their new
campaign ""Banca Limpia"" (Clean Banking) that the cluster bombs MAT-120 manufactured by the Spanish company Instalaza
in 2007 and used by Gaddafi to bomb Misrata in Libya, were financed by at least 8 Spanish banks: Cajalón (Grupo Caja
Rural), Caja España, Caja Mediterráneo, Bankinter, Ibercaja, Banco Popular,
Sabadell and La Caixa.
The confirmation of this news triggered the presentation in Spain of the report
""Dirty Business: Spanish banks that finance controversial weapons"" that
confirms that from 2006 to the present, 14
Spanish banks have been financially
and economically involved in 19 of the leading manufacturers of controversial
weapons that cause hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths worldwide.
Amongst these are nuclear weapons, depleted uranium and banned weapons such as
chemical and biological weapons, cluster bombs and anti-personnel mines. The
report highlights that:  • BBVA is the most active Spanish
bank in financing companies which manufacture controversial arms. Investment
funds managed by BBVA include shares of 12 companies and bonds of 2 companies.
BBVA has lent to 8 companies since early 2006 and has helped 3 companies in the
issue of bonds and another in the issue of shares..   • Santander occupies the second place in the financing of controversial arms producers,
with investment funds that include shares in 13 companies, has provided loans
to 7 companies and has issued bonds for 3 companies.    • BANKIA (Financial and Savings
Bank, the central body of the SIP formed by Caja Madrid, Bancaja, Caja Segovia, Caja Avila,
Caja Rioja, Caixa Laietana and Caja Insular de Canarias) have investment funds
that include shares of 8 producers of controversial weapons and has granted a
loan to a controversial arms producer.  The other Spanish institutions involved in the manufacture of controversial
weapons are: Banco Sabadell, Bankinter, BBK, Ibercaja, MAPFRE, Banco Madrid, Banco Popular,
CatalunyaCaixa, Banco Pastor, Finanduero and Banca March.  The report was prepared exclusively for SETEM by Profundo and can be downloaded at www.bancalimpia.com, the website where
anyone can find out about dodgy
investments of their bank, send a
letter to the banks requesting the withdrawal of this support, share this information on social
networks and financially support the
campaign.

Brazil ",Mining Giant Joins Belo Monte Dam,,,Belo Monte dam ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"
The world's second-largest mining corporation, Vale, has stepped into one of the world's most controversial dams: Belo Monte. With its new share in the dam, Vale - and the Brazilian government - 
are banking on the hope that the electricity from so-called ""clean"" dams
 can power Brazil's continued export of commodities to China. In the 
case of the Amazon, Belo Monte may help power a record expansion of 
dirty mining. In so many ways, a nightmare ""Avatar"" scenario is ever 
closer to reality.
Hydropower - far from the ""clean"" reputation that development pundits
 have given it - has long been utilized to power dirty mining and 
smelting operations around the world. Despite the Brazilian government's
 best efforts to paint Belo Monte as impact-free - check out the government's latest expensive public relations spots released in 17 Brazilian airports last week - Belo Monte will be no different, as Vale's 9.2% share will allow it 
to dedicate about 400 MW of the dam's guaranteed capacity for use in 
mining.
400 MW may be a drop in the bucket, but when added to Vale's 
investment in 9 other Brazilian dams, and after considering the more 
than 60 dams planned by the Brazilian government for the Amazon, the 
future of dam-powered mining in the Amazon becomes a bit more frightful.
 According
 to Brazilian Mining Institute IBRAM, over $40 billion USD of investment
 in mining is expected to cover the entire Brazilian Amazon through 
2015.
A New Mining Threat in the Amazon
Scroll through the slideshow above to see maps of current, planned, 
and future mining concessions, in that order, in the region of the Belo 
Monte Dam. Southeast of the Belo Monte Dam is one area of concern: the 
Carajás mines, the world's largest iron deposits, owned and operated by 
Vale. On the maps, the Carajás mines are colored red, near the bottom 
center of the image. Over
 the next few years, Vale is set to begin a massive expansion of these 
enormous Carajás mines, by adding 40 million tons of iron ore per year 
to the 90 million tons per year that are already produced there. With the expansion of the Carajás mines on the horizon, Vale's entry 
into Belo Monte looks like the portent of a drastically different 
landscape.
Vale's use of hydroelectric dams to power mining dates back almost 30 years to 1984, when the 256-foot high Tucuruí Dam (4000 MW) began operation, powering an explosion of iron ore extraction
 at the Carajás mines, and putting Brazil on the map in the global 
minerals trade. The Tucuruí Dam created the 72-meter deep Lago Tucuruí reservoir, which flooded 2,850 square kilometers.
 The reservoir displaced 35,000 people, flooded 38,700 hectares of the 
Parakanã Indigenous Reserve, and led to the removal and relocation of 
the Eastern Parakanã, a tribe that had been contacted only a decade 
earlier. Construction of the Tucuruí Dam attracted thousands of migrants
 to the area, which increased incidences of malaria and HIV. A full 
20,000 workers were laid off after the completion of Phase I of 
Tucuruí's construction, and by 1985, the Carajás mines had already 
produced 1 million tons of iron ore using Tucuruí's electricity. By 
1987, powered by Tucuruí Dam, the Carajás mines were producing 13.5 
million tons of iron ore per year.
In 1998, Phase II of the Tucuruí Dam began when Eletrobrás added 
eleven 375 MW Francis turbine generators, bringing Tucuruí's total 
installed capacity to 8370 MW. As a result, by 2006, the Carajás mine 
produced 81.7 million tons of iron ore per year, and in 2009, that 
number reached 90 million tons of iron ore per year. What worries 
technical experts and civil society alike is that the Belo Monte Dam may
 follow the same progression as Tucuruí: what began as a 4000 MW dam may
 become a larger project years down the road.
The impacts of the Carajás mines on indigenous people have continued through recent history. In 2006, in protest over the dangerous impacts of iron ore production near the Catete indigenous territory,
 Xikrín Kayapó took 600 Vale workers hostage and blocked the Carajás 
train, which exports 250,000 tons of iron ore daily to the port of Porta
 Madeira in São Luiz for export abroad. It was a true protest 
against the dangers of ruthless commodity export. As seen in the above 
maps, future mining concessions could even take place inside indigenous 
territories themselves, including the Catete territory.
If the electricity from mega-dams like Belo Monte and the Tapajós Complex comes on line, Vale - and also its competitors Alcoa, Gerdau, 
ArcelorMirral, Mineração do Rio Norte, AngloAmerican, and Colossus -- 
would be able to extract and refine unprecedented amounts of minerals 
from the soils of the Amazon. Mining would proliferate, and the Amazon 
could look more like the Alberta tar sands than a forest sea of green.
Dilma's Agenda for Vale
Vale may have decided to join the Belo Monte Dam only because the 
Brazilian government is playing a stiff hand to gain greater control 
over the company's profits. Indeed,
 Dilma recently sent CEO Roger Agnelli packing, a step towards gaining 
greater control over the company after it was partially privatized ten 
years ago.
Having Vale in the Belo Monte Dam is a way for the government to make
 sure that Vale's profits from Chinese commodity purchases flow more 
easily into Treasury coffers. Treasury capitalizations to the Brazilian 
Development Bank's (BNDES) have allowed BNDES to disburse record amounts
 to Brazilian industries, eclipsing the amount lent by multiateral 
development banks in the region. BNDES has disbursed $300 billion reais since 2008, including $20 billion reais for the Madeira Dam Complex, and an expected $25 billion reais or more for the Belo Monte Dam Complex. Why
 is greater government control of Vale a problem? Environmentally and 
socially, the sheer size of the mining operations planned for the Amazon
 should scare anyone, whether a company like Vale is privatized or 
state-owned. Mining is one of the dirtiest industrial activities on the 
planet, in terms of both its immediate environmental impacts and its CO2
 emissions. Also, mining enclaves more often than not lead to poverty 
and social conflict, rather than increased livelihoods and development 
benefits.
Financially, government control of Vale is a problem because there 
have been recent concerns over Brazil's monetary policy. Some say that 
there is a direct line between the Treasury and BNDES that acts as a 
""parallel economy"". According
 to Miriam Leitão, Brazil's military dictatorship similarly created a 
parallel economy that funneled public sector money directly into the pockets of government-owned developers. At the time, millions of reais were grafted from pension funds by government cronies and invested in 
pet hydropower projects such as Tucuruí Dam, Itaipú Dam, and Balbina 
Dam, three dams that emitted far greater amounts of greenhouse gases 
than equivalent-sized fossil fuel power plants. So far, commitments for 
the financing of the Belo Monte Dam have followed suit, as both BNDES 
and construction consortium Norte Energia, S.A. have relied on subsidies
 from Brazilian pension funds to bankroll their accounts.
With Vale in Belo Monte and the government taking greater control of 
the mining sector, it looks like the Amazon will turn increasingly into a
 hotbed for dirty mining. For centuries, citizens of the Brazilian 
Amazon have asked when their lands will be worth something greater than 
the resources extracted from them. With Vale now in Belo Monte, it 
doesn't look like they'll be getting an answer any time soon. "

Washington ",New report reveals ‘Dirty Business' practices of TransCanada pipelines,,,Keystone XL pipeline ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,United States,"
A
 report released today by Friends of the Earth reveals the nefarious 
business practices of TransCanada Pipelines, whose controversial 
proposal to pump tar sands oil across the American Midwest is currently 
under review by the Obama administration. 
Dirty
 Business: How TransCanada Pipelines bullies farmers, manipulates oil 
markets, threatens fresh water and skimps on safety in the United States documents underhanded and risky tactics employed by TransCanada in 
pursuing the Keystone XL tar sands oil project. These dirty practices 
include threatening U.S. farmers and ranchers along the proposed route 
of the pipeline, dodging safety concerns, and scheming to manipulate 
U.S. oil markets to drive up corporate profits. TransCanada has done all
 this while currying political influence behind the scenes to get 
approval of the pipeline.
""TransCanada
 has shown a pattern of abuse and deception,"" concluded Alex Moore, 
dirty fuels campaigner at Friends of the Earth and a co-author of the 
report. ""The environmental dangers of this dirty oil project-from 
increasing air pollution to contaminating drinking water supplies-were 
alarming enough. Now Americans learn TransCanada appears more interested
 in trying to mislead the U.S. government and intimidate and seize land 
belonging to farmers than it is in answering serious questions about 
safety.""
TransCanada's
 business practices are facing increasing scrutiny in Congress. Two 
weeks earlier, Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) called for a Federal Trade 
Commission investigation into the company's efforts to manipulate U.S. 
oil markets.
TransCanada's
 exploits have already made the company infamous in rural areas that 
would be crossed by the proposed Keystone XL pipeline. In Nebraska, 
""Stop the TransCanada Pipeline"" lawn signs are a common sight along its 
planned route. Typically oil-friendly East Texas has become a hotbed of 
resistance, with citizens organizing a coalition and hotline to fight 
the pipeline and share information about company abuse. Dozens of 
landowners have also taken their fight against TransCanada to the 
courts.
""While
 TransCanada is bullying its way through Middle America, it seems to 
think it can get its way with the Obama administration by hiring 
high-priced insider lobbyists and hiding its goal of manipulating oil 
prices. I hope President Obama and Secretary Clinton will not be so 
gullible. They should reject this unnecessary and dangerous pipeline,"" 
added Moore.
Recent
 developments make this closer look at TransCanada appropriate. Earlier 
this month, the Department of State released a Supplemental Draft 
Environmental Impact Statement (SDEIS) for the controversial Keystone XL
 pipeline and a public comment period will end June 6.  Local 
communities have asked the State Department to extend the comment period
 and to hold public hearings so they can review the agency's findings 
and share their experiences dealing with TransCanada.

London ",First Nations protest tar sands investment at Royal Bank of Scotland AGM,Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS)  ,United Kingdom,Canadian tar sands ,oil and gas,Canada,"
Representatives from some of Canada's
First Nations are preparing to demand in person that the Royal Bank of Scotland
(RBS) stops financing the controversial tar sands industry in Alberta, Canada,
at the bank's AGM today. 
The protest comes as new research, published by a coalition of UK and North American NGOs, shows that since
being bailed out with public money in 2008, RBS has raised £5.6 billion in
corporate financing to companies involved in Alberta's controversial tar sands extraction
and pipeline development, £2.2 billion of which was in the last twelve months. 
The First Nations representatives are expected to arrive at the AGM at
RBS's global head quarters in Gogarburn, Edinburgh, at 1pm. They will take into
the AGM a photo petition and motions from UK taxpayers angry that the bank is
investing their money in tar sands extraction and use the meeting to call on
the board to cease financing tar sands companies. 
Many First Nations communities are fighting the extensive tar sands
extraction on their tribal lands in Alberta,
as well as the proposed 1,170 kilometre long Enbridge Northern Gateway pipeline
from Alberta
to the British Columbian coast, which will pass through the territories of 80
First Nations, all of whom are opposed to it.  
The tar sands have been described as the most destructive industrial
project on the planet.  An area larger than England is being excavated by the
industry. The Athabasca river delta, once a
pristine boreal forest with clean rivers and lakes, has become a devastated
ecosystem of deforestation, open pit mines and toxic tailings ponds. Fish in
nearby waters regularly exhibit tumours and birds landing on contaminated
tailings ponds die. In neighbouring First Nations communities, where local
people have hunted and fished for many years, abnormally high rates of cancer
and immune system diseases are now being found.
Jasmine Thomas from the Yinka Dene Alliance is actively resisting the
RBS-financed Enbridge
Northern Gateway pipeline. RBS will be the fourth bank warned by the Yinka
Dene Alliance over the past two months for their involvement in raising funds
for Enbridge's pipeline and failure to adopt ethical policies that respects the
free, prior and informed consent of Indigenous Peoples who may be impacted:
""RBS has provided finance to Enbridge, which wants to
build its Northern Gateway tar sands pipelines through our territories, to
carry oil through many of our critical salmon-bearing rivers. A spill will happen
- Enbridge has over 60 pipeline spills each year. A single spill could destroy
our way of life and our culture, so 80 First Nations in British Columbia have
said NO to the pipeline. I'm here to warn RBS shareholders of the
legal and environmental risks of financing such controversial tar sands
companies, and to ask them to withdraw all corporate financing to Enbridge.""
Clayton Thomas-Muller, from Mathias Colomb Cree Nation, representing the
Indigenous Environmental Network, is also attending the AGM. He said:
""Banks in Canada
and in the US
have been put on notice for their dirty finance of the Canadian tar sands which
is resulting in the destruction of First Nations Peoples' way of life. The UK's
RBS, being a majority publicly-owned bank, should be under the greatest
scrutiny for its involvement in financing the Canadian tar sands and the
Enbridge Pipeline corporation and its controversial proposed Northern Gateway
tar sands pipeline.""
Notes to Editors
 The three First Nations representatives are being brought over to
the UK
by the Indigenous Environmental Network (IEN) and the UK Tar Sands Network and
are going into the AGM as proxies for existing RBS shareholders.
Jasmine Thomas is a Dene woman from Saik'uz British Columbia, Canada. Her
nation is a member nation to the Yinka Dene Alliance which includes Nadleh Whut'en,
Nak'azdli, Takla Lake, Saik'uz, and Wet'suwet'en First Nations, and is a leader
in the Save the Fraser Declaration, banning the transportation of Alberta tar
sands through their territories.
Clayton Thomas-Muller, of the Mathias Colomb Cree Nation, is an activist
for Indigenous rights and environmental justice and Tar Sands Campaigner with
IEN.
Melina Laboucan-Massimo is Lubicon Cree from Northern
 Alberta, and also works as Greenpeace Tar Sands Climate and Energy
Campaigner.
 Research on RBS's investment in companies working in Canadian tar
sands is published by a coalition of NGOs:  the World Development Movement,
Friends of the Earth Scotland, PLATFORM, People and Planet, SEAD, the
Indigenous Environmental Network, the Rainforest Action Network and the UK Tar
Sands Network.  Full details can be found at http://understory.ran.org/tag/rbs. 
RBS is a key financial backer of Canadian firm Enbridge, which plans to
build the pipeline.  RBS has raised £163 million in corporate finance for
Enbridge.    Enbridge has been heavily criticised in the past
for a number of oil spills from its other pipelines.   As well as
passing through the ancestral lands of 80 First Nations, the Alberta to Kitimat pipeline will also cross
hundreds of freshwater rivers and streams, raising concerns over pollution of
rivers and drinking water.
Since the banking crisis in Oct 2008, RBS has received more than £45
billion of UK
public money.  The UK
government now holds an 83% share in the bank. A coalition of UK-based NGOs,
including the World Development Movement, Friends of the Earth Scotland, SEAD,
People & Planet, PLATFORM and UK Tar Sands Network, has been campaigning
alongside the Canadian First Nations to get the UK government to use its
majority shareholding in RBS to force it to change its investment criteria away
from tar sands, and other fossil fuels, and to switch to financing the
transition to a low carbon economy.  Most recently they have called for
RBS's investment criteria to be aligned with those of the proposed Green
Investment Bank, in order to boost levels of investment in low carbon energy by
the magnitude required to stop irreversible climate change.
 The First Nations representatives will bring motions voted on by
members of the public, as majority shareholders in RBS but who are not
permitted entry to RBS's AGM.  The motions call for RBS to disinvest from
tar sands, coal and oil and for it to switch its investment strategy away from
fossil fuels and into low carbon energy.

Washington ",State Department Releases Supplemental Environmental Analysis on Keystone XL Tar Sands Oil Pipeline,,,Keystone XL pipeline ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,United States,"
WASHINGTON, D.C.-The U.S. State Department today 
released a Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement (SDEIS) for
 the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry highly 
polluting tar sands oil from Canada across six U.S. states to refineries
 in Texas.
The supplemental environmental analysis had been requested by 
communities that could be impacted by the pipeline, as well as by 
members of Congress, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The 
EPA gave the State Department's first Draft Environmental Impact 
Statement its worst possible rating, ""category-3 inadequate,"" for 
lacking detailed information about key environmental concerns, including
 pipeline spills, impacts on global warming, and pollution of air and 
water.
Alex Moore, Dirty Fuels Campaigner at Friends of the Earth, had the following statement:
""The State Department's first draft environmental analysis was so 
inadequate that it had no place to go but up in its second attempt. 
Unfortunately, the American public is still not getting a complete 
picture of the many serious dangers that this mega-pipeline would pose.
""On first reading, we are concerned that the State Department has still
 not done a serious and thorough analysis of significant dangers, 
including the safety of tar sands oil pipelines and the pollution caused
 by tar sands oil production.
""The State Department has taken an important step in categorically 
stating that tar sands oil has far higher greenhouse gas emissions than 
do other forms of oil used in the U.S.-this finding alone should lead 
the State Department to reject the permit for this pipeline.
""We are disturbed to see that the State Department is neither giving 
enough time for public comments nor has it scheduled any public 
hearings. This is not in line with President Obama's commitments to 
transparent and accountable government. The American people have a right
 to speak out about this risky dirty oil project.""
When releasing the SDEIS, the State Department indicated that it will 
accept public comments for only 45 days and did not announce any public 
hearings.
In a letter sent to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on April 4, 
2011, thirty-two local and national organizations, ranging from Friends 
of the Earth and the Sierra Club to the Nebraska Farmers Union and 
Dakota Rural Action, called on the State Department to hold a 120-day 
public comment period and public hearings in states along the pipeline's
 route.
The Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the Keystone XL pipeline is available here: http://www.keystonepipeline-xl.state.gov/clientsite/keystonexl.nsf/04_KX...
The letter sent by 32 groups to Secretary Clinton demanding a longer comment period and hearings is available here: http://www.foe.org/sites/default/files/Letter-Clinton-public-comment-SEI...
The following are excerpts from the SDEIS section stating that tar 
sands oil has far higher greenhouse gas emissions than other forms of 
oil used in the U.S.:
Page 239: ""As shown in Figure 3.14.3-1, the NETL WTW GHG emission 
estimates from gasoline produced from WCSB oil sands-derived crude oils 
are 17 percent higher than that the GHG emission estimates for gasoline 
produced from the average mix of crude oils consumed in the United 
States in 2005, and are approximately 19, 13, and 16 percent higher than
 GHG emission estimates for Middle East Sour, Mexican Heavy (i.e., 
Mexican Maya), and Venezuelan20 crude oils, respectively (NETL 2009).""
Page 243: ""Despite the differences in study design and input 
assumptions, it is clear that WCSB crude oils, as would likely be 
transported through the proposed Project, are on average somewhat more 
GHG-intensive than the crudes they would displace in the U.S. 
refineries. ... he life-cycle GHG emissions associated with 
transportation fuels produced in U.S. refineries would increase with 
increased imports of WCSB crude oils."" "

Bangladesh ",Energy at what cost? Protests against forced eviction from US-backed coal mine continue in Bangladesh,,,Phulbari coal mine ,mining - coal ,Bangladesh,"
As
 the sun rose on March 28, 2011, roughly 2,000 people gathered to 
demonstrate against a mining project that would displace tens of 
thousands of people in northwest Bangladesh and establish one of the 
largest open pit coal mines in the world.
Located in an agricultural region that is home
 to thousands of farming and indigenous families, the Phulbari Coal 
Project has been fiercely opposed by Bangladeshi citizens for over six 
years. Regardless, the UK-based company pursuing the project, Global 
Coal Management Resources, or GCM (formerly the Asia Energy 
Corporation), is expressing confidence that the mine will go forward.

In their most recent action to halt the 
project, protestors enforced a six-hour blockade of Bangladesh's 
railways and highways that began at 6 AM, reportedly forcing railway 
authorities to reschedule seven intercity trains and disrupting roads 
between the northwestern district of Dinajpur and other parts of the 
country.
In Phulbari, educational and business institutions reportedly remained closed during the blockade.
The demonstrators built on a demand made 
exactly one month ago: for the government to halt the mine and expel GCM
 Resources from the country. This time, they said, they will allow 15 
days for their demands to be met.

Responding to announcements of the protest, 
police and members of the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) were deployed in 
advance to guard GCM's office, the Phulbari railway station and other 
key establishments.
RAB, set up as an elite anticrime and 
antiterrorism force, has become notorious for what several human rights 
groups describe as the routine use of torture and an alarming number of 
extrajudicial killings that occur in RAB custody.
Although RAB has been denounced by Human Rights Watch as a ""government death squad,"" diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks in 2010 revealed that the UK has provided support to RAB, including training in
 ""investigative interviewing techniques"" and ""rules of engagement.""
The Phulbari Coal Project is now at a critical
 juncture. It was stalled in the planning phase when political 
instability in the country and widespread protests led to the imposition of emergency rule in Bangladesh in 2007. Following national elections in 2008, a new administration began actively reconsidering the mine.
The recent release of another WikiLeaks cable shows that the US has been exerting diplomatic pressure for the project's approval, citing US corporate interests.
Forced Eviction on a Massive Scale 
According to GCM's project plans,
 the Phulbari coal mine would have a lifespan of at least 36 years and 
extract 16 million tons of coal annually at peak production. Of this, 
three million tons would be used for domestic energy consumption, with 
the construction of at least one 500 megawatt coal-fired electricity 
plant. The remaining coal would be exported.
The project's draft resettlement plan calls for the open pit mine and associated infrastructure to acquire nearly 6,000 hectares of land.
Estimates of the number of people who would be
 evicted from their homes and lands in order to make way for the immense
 mega-project vary widely and are disputed.
According to GCM, the project would displace 
nearly 50,000 people (49,487 people and 11,247 households). However, a 
2006 Expert Committee report commissioned by the Bangladeshi government 
concluded that nearly 130,000 people would be directly affected, and as 
many as 220,000 people would suffer reduced access to water for drinking
 and irrigation, with uncertain displacement impacts over time.
GCM's estimate of the number of indigenous 
people displaced is similarly contested. While GCM says some 2,200 
indigenous people would be displaced, independent researchers and 
Bangladesh's Jatiya Adivasi Parishad (National Indigenous Union) 
estimate that 50,000 people belonging to 23 different tribal groups would be evicted.
""The project threatens some of Bangladesh's 
most vulnerable indigenous peoples, who trace their ancestry in the 
region back 5,000 years,"" says Paula Palmer, director of Cultural 
Survival's Global Response program. Indigenous leaders fear that their 
ancient cultures and languages would not survive forced displacement and
 dispersal of their communities. In a recent interview,
 Palmer noted that ""the mine may mean ethnocide"" for the indigenous 
peoples it would forcibly resettle, who ""will not be able to maintain 
the cultural traditions, religious practices and languages that have 
sustained them for thousands of years.""
Impacts on Food and Water 
Over 80 percent of all land slated for project
 development is farmland. Due to its elevation and location, Phulbari is
 one of the few agricultural regions in Bangladesh that is protected 
from flooding. Project opponents are concerned that the loss of these 
agricultural lands will undermine efforts to overcome hunger in a country in which nearly half of all people currently do not have enough food.
Bangladesh is also one of the world's most 
densely populated countries. Displaced families would thus require 
significant support in regaining land and housing, yet project plans 
state that people displaced for the mine will not receive replacement 
land - nor will other vital resources, including fish ponds, timber and 
bamboo trees, be replaced.
""The company is offering displaced families 
cash, not equivalent land, because no land is available in Bangladesh,"" 
notes Palmer, yet, she says, ""studies show that cash payments to such 
'development refugees' results in their impoverishment.""
Project impacts on water for household and 
agricultural use are also expected to be severe. According to the 2006 
Expert Committee report,
 dewatering operations required to keep water from entering mine pits up
 to 1,000 meters in depth would result in a massive reduction of 
groundwater throughout a vast region and reduce access to water for 
220,000 people.
The prospect of Phulbari's tube wells running 
dry has raised grave concerns there, where over half of all households 
report that they do not currently have enough water to meet their needs.
Environmental Risks
The Mangrove Action Project recently launched an international campaign to halt the Phulbari project, citing risks to
 the Sundarbans Reserved Forest (SRF), a United Nations Education, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)-protected mangrove forest 
and wetlands that contains over half of Bangladesh's remaining natural 
forest. The vast wetlands include three wildlife refuges - all of which 
are on UNESCO's World Heritage Site list - and support at least 58 rare 
and threatened species - including Bangladesh's last remaining 
population of the royal Bengal tiger.
Despite its protected status, plans for the 
Phulbari Coal Mine call for coal to be transported through the 
Sundarbans by a fleet of barges to a floating offshore loading facility,
 where it will be transferred to oceangoing vessels.
Significantly, the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) for the project commissioned by GCM rates the risk that barge fuel 
could contaminate the SRF as ""extremely high"" and ""one of the most 
significant issues associated with the Project.""
In the event of a ""worst case scenario"" oil 
spill, the ESIA states, ""it is likely there will be damage to the SRF 
shoreline"" and ""extreme mortality or severe damage to mangroves and 
other shoreline plant species.""
There are also serious environmental and 
health hazards associated with coal mining itself. Although GCM 
maintains that local residents can continue farming some project lands 
during and after mining operations, this ignores the risks posed by 
coal. Mining coal unearths toxic heavy metals, including mercury and acid-forming sulphur, that contaminate soil, water and air, making lands that have been mined less than ideal for agriculture.
Protest and Resistance 
The March 2011 demonstration was the latest 
protest in an ongoing battle to halt the project. Massive public 
protests involving thousands of citizens began in 2005 and continue 
through today.
August 26, 2006 is now commemorated as 
Phulbari Day, an annual day of mourning for those who lost their lives 
and suffered serious injuries when a government-backed paramilitary 
group fired indiscriminately on tens of thousands of people protesting 
the project. Three people were killed, including a 14-year-old child, 
and more than 200 people were wounded.
This indiscriminate use of violence generated 
nationwide protests and a four-day general strike, which were brought to
 an end only when the government signed an agreement calling for the 
permanent expulsion of Asia Energy from the country and a ban on 
open-pit mining.
GCM was forced to suspend its operations at that time, and its personnel fled the country under police escort after demonstrators burned down the company's project information office.
Within Bangladesh, national opposition to the 
project has been led by the National Committee to Protect Oil, Gas, 
Mineral Resources and Ports, whose local leader, Mr. Nuruzuman, was reportedly tortured by the Bangladesh military in 2008 for his activities.
""Despite violence and intimidation aimed at 
silencing opponents, some 100,000 people participated in the final 
rally, ending an incredible one-week, 250-mile Long March from Dhaka, 
Bangladesh's capital, to Phulbari last October, notes Joanna Levitt, 
executive director of the International Accountability Project, a human rights organization working to halt the mining project.
On February 28, 2011, roughly 2,000 protestors
 gathered for the rally and highway blockade in Phulbari, stranding some
 500 passenger buses and vehicles on both sides of the highway.
Opponents' key demands remain unchanged: the 
government must fulfill the agreement signed on August 31, 2006, which 
bans open-pit coal mining and calls for GCM to be permanently expelled 
from the country.
GCM Resources
Despite sustained opposition, GCM remains 
confident that it will be able to move the project forward. The 
government of Bangladesh plans to announce a new coal policy by June 
2011, and GCM expects that the new policy will clear the way for them to
 secure the ""green light"" that their investors are impatiently calling 
for.
In January of 2011, Cultural Survival sent a letter to GCM Chief Executive Steve Bywater calling for an immediate halt to 
planning for the mine, saying that it would forcibly remove thousands of
 indigenous people from their homes and farmlands, in violation of the 
UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).
In a reply dated March 8, 2011, Bywater disputed this claim, saying that, ""Our 
resettlement programme will recognize the right of all affected people 
to free, prior and informed consent."" However, Bywater's reply does not 
address the fact that no one in Phulbari is being offered the option of 
saying no to eviction and resettlement.
Bywater also notes that the project will bring
 the country needed electricity, and ""roughly a third of the revenues 
generated by the Project will go to the Government in the form of 
royalties, corporate taxes, customs and duties, and taxes paid by 
employees, suppliers and contractors.""
GCM's claims regarding financial benefits to 
Bangladesh are strongly contested by project opponents, who argue that 
the nation will lose, not profit, if GCM is permitted to extract the 
country's nonrenewable resources while paying only six percent in 
royalties and profits.
Taking Bywater's figures at face value, 
two-thirds of project revenues will go outside of Bangladesh - and, a 
recently released WikiLeaks documents suggests, toward wealthy investors
 in the Global North.
WikiLeaks Reveals Evidence of US Interference
In December 2010, WikiLeaks released a diplomatic cable that revealed that the US ambassador to Bangladesh, James Moriarty, has
 actively intervened to push the Phulbari Coal Project forward.
In the July 2009 cable, Moriarty cites 60 
percent US investment in GCM and urges Tawfiq Elahi Chowdhury, the 
energy advisor to Bangladesh's prime minister, to authorize open-pit 
mining as ""the best way forward.""
Moriarty also notes that Chowdhury admitted 
that the coal mine was ""politically sensitive in the light of the 
impoverished, historically oppressed tribal community residing on the 
land,"" but that Chowdhury agreed to build support for the project 
through the parliamentary process.
""WikiLeaks cables prove that US officials 
chose to ignore the tens of thousands of Bangladeshi people marching in 
the streets to oppose this mine. Behind closed doors, they aggressively 
pushed for a reckless coal project that would evict and impoverish 
thousands in Bangladesh - and line the pockets of a few hedge fund 
managers in the US,"" commented Levitt.
According to the international organization BankTrack,
 major shareholders in GCM Resources are Aurora Investment Trust PLC, 
Christian Leone, Credit Suisse First Boston Equities Ltd, LCG Holdings 
LLC, Luxor Capital Group and Polo Resources Ltd.
LCG and Luxor Capital Group are owned by Christian Leone, a US citizen and former Goldman Sachs employee who also operates a New York-based hedge fund in his own name.
Energy at What Price?
Over 100 civil society organizations from 31 
countries have endorsed a letter to the Phulbari project's worldwide 
financial backers, detailing human rights abuses and environmental 
concerns associated with the project and calling on private banks to 
withdraw their support.
Their concerns include the potential for 
further violence against project opponents. The Expert Committee 
commissioned by Bangladesh's government shares these concerns, warning 
of ""a high risk of social unrest and conflict"" if GCM attempts to 
forcibly relocate tens of thousands of people, most of whom have 
land-based livelihoods.
Despite these warnings and sustained protests 
against the project, GCM continues to maintain that the project would be
 good for the people of Bangladesh and would bring needed electricity.
Coal, however, is not the only energy option. An alternative development model can be seen in the Indian state of Orissa, which recently installed decentralized 
solar power to provide energy to 2,000 villages without large-scale 
displacement of people or destruction of their lands and communities
Many within Phulbari regard the GCM's coal 
mine project as a violation of their rights. As one community member 
interviewed by the International Accountability Project said: ""This 
movement is for human rights. This is against the aggression of the 
multinational companies. So, the international community should come 
forward to save the human rights, to save the community."" "

San Fransisco ",New report card exposes largest financers of mountaintop removal coal mining,Bank of America ,United States,Mountain top removal coal mining ,mining - coal ,United States,"
A new
report card issued today by Rainforest Action Network and the Sierra Club ranks
ten of the world's largest banks on their financing of mountaintop removal coal
mining projects. Since 2010, the report card found that the top three
financiers of the destructive mining practice are PNC, Citi, and UBS. Deutsche
Bank and GE Capital received failing grades for having no policy in place to
guide funding of mining companies. Credit Suisse
and Wells Fargo were found to have the strongest policies in the sector.
View the
report card at http://ran.org/reportcard.
The report
card comes as Appalachian residents arrive in the nation's capital for their
""Week in Washington,"" raising awareness about the destruction in
their communities. The document explores the financing practices of Bank of
America, Citi, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, GE Capital, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan
Stanley, PNC, UBS and Wells Fargo. Since January
2010, the report card found that these ten banks have provided more than $2.5
billion in loans and bonds to companies practicing
mountaintop removal coal mining.
Mountaintop
removal is the subject of enormous public opposition as well as growing
regulatory and legislative scrutiny, which banks have been forced to address. Since
last year's report card (April 2010), there have been five new policies on mountaintop
removal from Chase, Wells Fargo, PNC, UBS, and Credit Suisse.
""Mountaintop
removal coal mining is bad for health and bad for business. From a regulatory
and financial perspective this disastrous mining practice is too big of a risk
for banks, and certainly too big of a risk to America's families,"" said Amanda
Starbuck of Rainforest Action Network. ""Plain and simple, banks beware-mountaintop
removal coal mining is a bad investment.""
From a
regulatory perspective, the report shows that of all the mountaintop removal permits
reviewed in 2010 by the EPA, 99 were denied or withdrawn, 84 are still pending
and 18 have been approved. The report also finds that in 2010, coal production
figures for the mountaintop removal sector were in decline. Mining giants, like
Arch Coal, are moving away from Central Appalachia coal production, and
focusing on new opportunities in Wyoming's Powder River Basin and on the West
Coast with export terminals.
""Mountaintop
removal coal mining has no place in a clean energy economy, and the banks that
finance this destructive practice deserve our scrutiny,"" said Mary Anne
Hitt, Director of the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal Campaign. ""Those who fund
mountaintop removal coal mining are lighting the fuse that leads to the
devastation of communities, waterways and landscapes across Appalachia.""
RAN
and Sierra Club disclosed the findings of this report card to each of the ten
analyzed banks and offered them the opportunity to improve their grades with
further information or changes to banking policies. In response to initial
report card findings, three banks
will be strengthening their lending guidelines on mountaintop removal.
Credit
Suisse topped the list, earning an ""A-"" for its efforts to promote responsible
mining practices. Credit Suisse has confirmed that
they do not finance the extraction of coal in a mountaintop removal setting. 
The
report card calls for the ten banks reviewed to strengthen their policies and
cease their financial support for mountaintop removal. The ‘best practice'
recommended in the report card is a clear exclusion policy on commercial
lending and investment banking services for all coal companies who practice
mountaintop removal coal extraction.
Bank of America was the first bank to issue a public policy
limiting its mountaintop removal financing back in December 2008. Citi followed
in August 2009, Credit Suisse in September 2009, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan in
May 2010 and Wells Fargo in July of 2010. While each banks' policies differ,
they all demonstrate concern about the environmental and investment risks
associated with mountaintop mining, and all of the banks have made clear moves
away from companies who primarily focus on this form of extraction.
 
Mountaintop
removal mining is a devastating form of mining where companies blow the tops
off mountains to reach a thin seam of coal and then dump the waste rock into
valleys below. This destructive practice has buried nearly 2,000 miles of
streams and threatens to destroy 1.4 million acres of land by 2020. The mining
destroys Appalachian communities, the health of coalfield residents and any
hope for positive economic growth.

Washington D.C. ",Organization of American States Requests Immediate suspension of Belo Monte Dam in the Brazilian amazon,,,Belo Monte dam ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"

The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), part of the
Organization of American States (OAS), has officially requested the
Brazilian government immediately suspend the Belo Monte Dam complex in
the Amazonian state of Para, citing the project's potential harm to the
rights of traditional communities living within the Xingu river basin.
According to the IACHR, the Brazilian government must comply with legal
obligations to undertake a consultation process that is ""free, prior,
informed, of good faith and culturally appropriate"" with indigenous
peoples threatened by the project before further work can proceed. The
Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs must inform the OAS within
fifteen days regarding urgent measures undertaken to comply with the
Commission's resolution.
The IACHR's decision responds to a complaint submitted in November
2010 on behalf of local, traditional communities of the Xingu river
basin. The complaint was presented by the Xingu Alive Forever Movement
(MXVPS), the Coordination of Indigenous Organizations in the Brazilian
Amazon (COIAB), the Prelacy of the Roman Catholic Church in the Xingu
region, the Indigenous Missionary Council (CIMI), the Pará Society for
the Defense of Human Rights (SDDH), Global Justice and the
Inter-American Association for Environmental Defense (AIDA). According
to the complaint, there were no appropriate consultations with affected
indigenous and riverine communities regarding the impacts of the
mega-dam project. The document argues that the dam would cause
irreversible social and environmental damage, including forced
displacement of communities, while threatening one of the Amazon's most
valuable areas for biodiversity conservation.
""By recognizing the rights of indigenous people to prior and
informed consultations, the IACHR is requesting that the Brazilian
government stop the licensing and construction of the Belo Monte Dam
project to ensure their right to decide,"" said Roberta Amanajas, SDDH
lawyer. ""Continuing this project without proper consultations would
constitute a violation of international law. In that case, the
Brazilian government would be internationally liable for the negative
impacts caused by the dam.""
The IACHR also requests Brazil to adopt ""vigorous and comprehensive
measures"" to protect the lives and personal integrity of isolated
indigenous peoples in the Xingu river basin, as well as effective
measures to prevent the spread of diseases and epidemics among
traditional communities threatened by the project.
""The IACHR's decision sends a clear message that the Brazilian
government's unilateral decisions to promote economic growth at any
cost are a violation of our country's laws and the human rights of
local traditional communities,"" said Antonia Melo, MXVPS coordinator.
""Our leaders no longer can use economic ""development"" as an excuse to
ignore human rights and to push for projects of destruction and death
to our natural heritage and to the peoples of Amazon, as is the case of
Belo Monte.""
""The OAS's decision is a warning to the federal government and a
call to Brazilian society to broadly discuss the highly authoritarian
and predatory development model being implemented in this country,""
said Andressa Caldas, Global Justice director. Caldas recalls examples
of human rights violations caused by other infrastructure projects
within the PAC, the federal government's ""Accelerated Growth Program.""
""There are numerous cases involving the forced displacement of families
without compensation, as well as serious environmental impacts, social
disruption of communities, rising violence in areas surrounding
construction sites and poor working conditions.""
Criticism of the Belo Monte dam comes not only from civil society
organizations, and local communities, but also from scientists,
researchers, and government institutions. The Federal Public
Prosecutor's office in Pará state has already filed ten civil lawsuits
against the mega-project that are still awaiting final decisions.
""I am very moved by this news,"" said Sheyla Juruna, an Indigenous
leader of the Juruna community in Altamira. ""Today, more than ever, I
am sure that we were right to expose the Brazilian government -
including the federal judicial system - for violations of the rights of
indigenous peoples in the Xingu and of all those who are fighting
together to protect life and a healthy environment. We will maintain
our firm resistance against the implementation of the Belo Monte Dam
complex.""
The IACHR's decision is founded on international law established by
the American Convention on Human Rights, Convention 169 of the
International Labour Organisation (ILO), the United Nations Declaration
on Indigenous Rights (UNDRIP), and the UN Convention on Biological
Diversity (CBD), as well as the Brazilian Constitution itself.

Tokyo Japan ",Decommissioning cost of Fukushima Daiichi might be over US$90billion,Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation ,Japan,,,,"
FGW has estimated that total decommissioning cost of crippled nuclear plants in Fukusima Daiich of Tokyo Electric Company(TEPCO), which might be over 7trillion yen (almost US$ 90billion).
Japanese government and TEPCO have already admitted to decommission  their facilities. We have calculated  those future cost by past experiences.
 In the world, so far there are 80 examples of carried out decommissioning of commercial nuclear plants, due to aging or economical reasons. These decommissioning cost are different with the types and the durations of operation of each plants. But according to experiences in USA, average cost of decommissioning nuclear power plants per 1kw generation has been US$1000. On the other hand, in UK, which has been culclated as US$ 1750 per 1kw(see the following report of Greenpeace US:
http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/Global/usa/planet3/publications/nukes/Decommissioning%20Risks.pdf)
Applying these estimated data to Fukushima case, total cost might be from 400b yen(US$5b) to 700b yen(US$8.75b).  But these data were coming from culculations under the normal conditions. In case of accidental situation such as Fukushima, GAO, USA governmental accounting body, has mentioned more serious estimations.
It said that in catastrophic case, decommissioning cost must be increased ten times than normal situations, due to several factors such as setting wide-range of keeping out zone, say within 30 km radius from the accidental site or purchasing properties within the zone from land owners, copamies and individuals and paying compensations to farmers and ranchers who used to operate the area and so on .
GAO's  cost estimation for catastrophic case would be US$ 15billion per plant. When we apply this estimation to our crippled Fukushima, total amount of decommissioning for 6 plants would be up to US$90b. When we apply GAO's recommendation of ""ten times than normal situation"",cost would increase to  US$50b ~ 87.5b.The highest amount of this range is almost similar with previous mentioned catastrophic case (US$15b per plant).
Therefore we think the maximum cost of decommissioning of Fukushima Daiichi would be up to 7b yen(US$90b). This amount is well exceed of TEPCO's net worth which is roughly estimated 3t yen(US$A37.5b). We think TEPCO might be insolvent debtor in the near future. 
In addition, Goldman Sachs US securities houses was reported that it has  calculated decommissioning plants not only Fukushima Daiichi but  also Dainiwhich has 4 nuclear plants but not damaged so hard. We think why GS has regarded both sites as decomissioning plants might be its locations where are in the same coastal zone within 20km from crippled Daiichi.
If  the government sets keeping out zone within 20km or 30km, operation in Daini must be prohibited, even plants inDaini are not damaged. If we consider Daini is normal reactors, we estimate its decommissioning cost as US$1000~1750 per 1kw electric generation. Therefore the total estimation of  decommissioning would increase to 10 trillion yen(US$ 125b).

Nijmegen, Netherlands ","One month into Fukushima disaster, HSBC signs advisory contract for nuclear power plant in earth quake zone",HSBC ,United Kingdom,Belene nuclear power plant ,energy plants - nuclear,Bulgaria,"
Exactly one month after the start of the Fukushima disaster, HSBC signed an agreement to analyse and find investors for the long delayed and highly controversial Belene nuclear power plant project in Bulgaria. 
Belene is one of the oldest and most controversial nuclear projects in Europe. It is plagued with numerous problems, from its location in an earthquake zone in a country with a poor nuclear safety culture, to the use of an untested Russian reactor technology. 
Jan Haverkamp, Greenpeace energy campaigner for Europe, recounts the long history of the project: ""As early as 1983 Soviet scientists warned that this location was not suitable for an NPP due to the seismic risks. In 1990 the Bulgarian Academy of Science came to the conclusion that the project should be dropped for economic, environmental and social reasons and the Bulgarian Government subsequently termed Belene to be ‘technically unsafe and economically unviable'. However, due to strong vested interests behind the project, Belene has become a kind of nuclear zombie and continues to pop up on the Bulgarian Government's agenda, in spite of the fact that this is a dangerous and irresponsible project.""
Since 2006, over a dozen banks and several utilities have turned down offers to participate in or finance Belene. Among these are, for example, Deutsche Bank, UniCredit, Citibank, RWE, E.ON and Electrabel.
Heffa Schücking, from the German NGO urgewald, says: ""Some banks had to find out the hard way that Belene is a no-go. After protests took place in front of Deutsche Bank and HypoVereinsbank branch offices throughout Germany, both banks were forced to withdraw from the project. RWE followed suit in 2009 after major shareholders attacked the company's plan to provide 49% of the equity for Belene. European environment organizations are united in their opposition to this project and we are ready to move against HSBC if needed.""
The Fukushima disaster continues and shows us just how deadly a mix nuclear and seismic risks are. ""As even the European Commission recently announced that it will review the legal and safety framework, including the seismic risk of the Belene project, it is incomprehensible that HSBC chose this moment in time to replace BNP Paribas as a financial advisor to the project,"" says Yann Louvel, climate and energy campaign coordinator for the BankTrack network. He concludes: ""The decision of HSBC is deeply disturbing. Instead of drawing the lessons from the Fukushima catastrophe, reviewing its nuclear policy and stepping out of this dangerous sector altogether, HSBC is now involved in one of the worst nuclear projects around the world. We call on the bank to immediately step back and abandon the Belene deal.""
Notes:
 HSBC is hired by the Bulgarian government for consultancy services, to help it decide how to proceed and attract new investors for the Belene project.

United States ",Official Review of the Xayaburi Dam Reveals Project Flaws,,,Xayaburi dam ,energy plants - dams,Laos,"
A long-brewing regional debate over whether or not to build the proposed Xayaburi  Dam on the Mekong River has hit boiling point.  If there were any delusional fantasies remaining that mainstream dam building could be sustainable, the Mekong River Commission's new independent 
technical review of the proposed Xayaburi Dam has surely dissolved them.
  The MRC Secretariat's expert review of the Xayaburi Dam's key 
project documents - released a few days ago - highlights the grave 
environmental and social harms associated with the project, while also 
identifying considerable knowledge gaps that remain and require 
comprehensive study over the short to long-term.  The harm caused to the Mekong River's fisheries alone will be devastating. As
 the Mekong River hosts the world's largest freshwater fishery and ranks
 as the second most biodiverse river in the world, the dam will block an
 important fish migration route and forever alter the river's habitat. 
The review warns that as many as 23 to 100 fish species would be 
threatened, including the Mekong Giant Catfish and four others found in 
the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Based on the review's study of 
the cascade of six dams, including the Xayaburi Dam, proposed in this 
stretch of the river, fishery losses are estimated at around 66,000 tons
 per year, which is nearly half of the entire estimated yield for the 
country of Laos. While the exact loss associated with the Xayaburi Dam 
is not known, the review states that ""Experience from other areas 
suggests 
that most of the loss would be associated with construction of the first
 dam in the cascade.""  With the majority of the basin's population 
dependent on the river's resources, the loss would place the livelihoods
 of more than 450,000 people at risk. 
While the project developer's Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) made false claims that fishery losses could be mitigated, the MRC's 
review on the other hand minces no words. Its experts state that 
transboundary impacts to fisheries will remain even if international 
best practice is applied to dam design and operation, as ""there is no 
definitive solution to mitigate the lost fish production in the Xayaburi
 Dam area."" The review also dispels the myth that reservoir fisheries 
may be an effective mitigation measure, by stating that there is a 
""misunderstanding that damming the river to create a series of 
run-of-the river reservoirs could increase the fishery yields.""  While
 this project should clearly be canceled, numerous questions remain. 
Will the future decision over Xayaburi reflect science and reason, or 
will it be based solely on politics? Will public accountability be at 
stake given the expressed opposition to the project during the public consultation process? How can the 
continuation of the decision-making process be justified given the fact 
that the project has failed to meet the minimal requirements set out by 
the MRC's Project Design Guidelines, let alone international best 
practice?With so much at stake, one hopes that facts will be 
central to the final regional decision-making meeting scheduled for 
April 21st.

Manaus, Brazil ",James Cameron brings Arnold Schwarzenegger to Amazon to See firsthand a battle between old and new energy,,,Belo Monte dam ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"

James Cameron held a press conference yesterday with Amazonian
indigenous leaders and environmental experts following his return with
Arnold Schwarzenegger from a visit to the Big Bend region of the Xingu
River, the site of the proposed Belo Monte Dam in the Brazilian Amazon.
Calling the Dam a ""human rights crisis"" for Brazil, Cameron - who has
visited the Xingu Region three times in the past year - made an appeal
to the Brazilian government and public to use this crisis as an
opportunity to lead Brazil into a more ecologically sound energy path.
Cameron also participated in the Global Sustainability Forum where he
shared the stage with Schwarzenegger in a dynamic discussion touching
on the challenges that countries face when moving from an old model of
energy, exemplified by large dams, to a new model based on energy
efficiency, solar and wind power. Cameron pointed to the experience of
California under Schwarzenegger's leadership in stimulating growth in
green jobs, solar and wind power.
Cameron was joined by legendary Kayapo Chief Raoni Txucarramãe,
indigenous leader Sheyla Juruna of the Xingu Alive Forever movement,
and Philip Fearnside and Francisco Hernandez, leading specialists on
climate change and sustainable energy in Brazil.
""The Brazilian government is not open to dialogue with its own people,""
said Sheyla Juruna, a leader of the Juruna people who are directly
affected by the Belo Monte Dam. ""It consistently violates its own laws
and constitution, especially with regard to the requirement to consult
indigenous people about the impacts of Belo Monte and other
mega-projects.""
Kayapo Chief Raoni Txucarramãe said his people are holding
assemblies and preparing for a campaign of resistance to stop the dam.
""President Dilma and Lula before her have shown a lack of compassion
for the enormous suffering that the flooding and displacement the
project will bring to my people and the other peoples of the Xingu.
""The government has been ignoring the findings of the courts against
the illegality of the building of the dams, so we are going over the
heads of government and the courts to organize broad alliances of both
indigenous and non-indigenous people, NGOs and government to appeal
directly to public opinion and support,"" continued Txucarramãe.
Cameron said, ""Listening to people on the ground in the forest who
will be directly affected, and to the experts, it's clear that Belo
Monte is an ill-conceived project not only in terms of economic
efficiency, but especially because of the lack of transparency,
participation and inclusion of indigenous peoples and local
communities.
""The most important thing is to raise awareness in Brazil that Belo
Monte is not a good solution for meeting the country's energy needs -
given its poor economic and the moral and ethical issues, to say
nothing of its enormous toll on indigenous peoples and other
inhabitants of the Xingu. The Brazilian taxpayers could save billions
by cancelling the dam and investing in truly renewable energy.
""Meeting the challenges of a green energy future requires that we all
learn from each other - US from Brazil and Brazil from examples like
California. Arnold Schwarzenegger spoke here about how breaking a new
path towards a green energy future has created more jobs in California
than traditional industry and service sectors. Brazil has the potential
to be a world leader in promoting sustainable energy at a global
scale,"" concluded Cameron.
""We need to dispel the myth that big dams represent clean and
renewable energy, considering their enormous social and environmental
consequences,"" said Francisco Hernandez, an energy policy expert from
the University of São Paulo. ""Brazil is not pursuing a clean and
diversified energy matrix but rather developing a single gigantic
source, in spite of all of the recognized problems these projects
bring.""
Philip Fearnside, scientist with the National Institute of Amazon
Research (INPA), pointed to the significant climate footprint of large
dams given their methane emissions, a global warming gas 25-35 times
more potent than CO2. ""While economic development is the stated goal of
the dam, the great part of its electricity goes to metal smelting, for
example producing aluminum ingots, a raw material which is mostly
exported and creating only 2.7 jobs per gigawatt hour of electricity,""
said Fearnside.
The risky $17 billion Belo Monte Dam would be the world's third
largest dam. It would divert nearly the entire flow of the Xingu River
along a 62-mile stretch. Its reservoirs will flood more than 120,000
acres of rainforest and local settlements, displace between 20,000 and
40,000 people and generate vast quantities of methane. A partial
installation license was issued for the dam project in late January
despite the dam building consortium's failure to meet dozens of
environmental and social pre-conditions.

New Delhi, Berlin ",Deutsche Bank cancels interest in Jaitapur nuclear project India,Deutsche Bank ,Germany,Jaitapur nuclear power plant ,energy plants - nuclear,India,"

India's Nuclear Power Corporation (NPCIL) encounters difficulties in raising funds for a new nuclear plant situated in a earth quake prone zone. Earlier this year, the company invited over a dozen large banks from around the world to participate in financing the construction of the world's largest nuclear complex near the town of Jaitapur in Western India. While Germany's Commerzbank turned down this invitation, other international banks such as BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole, Citibank and Deutsche Bank expressed interest in participating in the project.
Last week, people close to the situation confirmed to NGOs, enquiring about the possible role of Deutsche bank in this project, that Deutsche bank has decided to cancel its participation in the bidding process for Jaitapur.
""We welcome this decision of Deutsche Bank and call on other banks to follow suit,"" says Heffa Schuecking, director of the German environment and human rights organization ‘urgewald'. Jaitapur is one of the world's most controversial nuclear projects as it is located in a high risk zone for earthquakes.
The Indian Government, however, ignored these risks during site selection for the project. According to Karuna Raina of Greenpeace India, ""India not only has an alarming track record regarding nuclear hazards but also a complacent safety culture."" She points out, that in 1994 for example, the containment of the Kaiga nuclear power plant in the Indian State of Karnataka collapsed due to flawed construction.
""It is astonishing that after ‘Fukushima', the Indian government is still willing to gamble on Jaitapur being different. Responsible banks should back away from such highly irresponsible projects, especially when located in a earthquake zone; we expect banks to learn at least that lesson from the disaster in Japan"" warns Yann Louvel, climate and energy coordinator of the international NGO network BankTrack.
Among the other banks that have been approached to finance Jaitapur are HSBC, Standard Chartered, Société Génerale, Crédit Agricole, Citibank and Santander. Financial advisor for the project is BNP Paribas.
BankTrack, Greenpeace and urgewald have written to all banks asking them to dissociate themselves from this project.

London ","Governments should name banks that took corrupt money from Gaddafi, Mubarak and Ben Ali",,,,,,"
The
                  governments that have frozen funds controlled by
                  Gaddafi, Mubarak, Ben Ali and their cronies should
                  name the banks holding their
                  assets, anti-corruption group Global Witness demanded
                  today. A clear message
                  must be sent to banks that doing business with corrupt
                  dictators is
                  unacceptable: first, those banks holding dirty money
                  should be publicly named
                  and then regulators need to devise a new system which
                  stops banks from taking
                  suspect funds in the first place.
Some
                  $32 billion has been frozen by the US, $3.2 billion by
                  the UK,
                  and other countries
                  such as Switzerland,
                  South Africa,
                  Japan
                  and Austria
                  have frozen funds connected with North African
                  despots. This has been hailed by
                  governments as an achievement, but it actually
                  highlights the catastrophic failure
                  of the anti-money laundering laws that are supposed to
                  have kept dirty money
                  out of the financial system in the first place.
Corrupt
                  rulers control billions of dollars stashed in bank
                  accounts, despite earning far more modest official
                  salaries. By accepting this
                  money, banks are propping up brutal regimes by
                  allowing them to pay off
                  political cronies, rig elections and terrorise their
                  people.
“This
                  rash of asset seizures offers belated
                  recognition that these billions should never have been
                  under the personal
                  control of dictators. On what
                  basis could the banks involved possibly have thought
                  that the funds in these
                  accounts were legitimately earned? The banks shouldn’t have taken
                  the money, and governments shouldn’t have let them
                  take it. These funds
                  belong to Libya,
                  Egypt
                  and Tunisia
                  and the people of these
                  countries now have a right to know where their money
                  is,” said Anthea Lawson,
                  head of the Kleptocracy campaign at
                  Global Witness.
Currently
                  banks are required to do due diligence checks to
                  ensure they know their customer’s identity and source
                  of wealth. If they
                  have concerns the money is illegally earned, they are
                  supposed to file a report
                  with the authorities. The problem is that banks are
                  not motivated to dig deep
                  into their client’s source of wealth because they
                  might find something
                  that makes it hard to accept the money, so they adopt
                  a box-ticking approach to
                  their due diligence checks.
Governments
                  need to send a clear message that this behaviour
                  by banks is unacceptable. As well as naming the banks
                  that hold the frozen
                  funds, they must devise, and effectively implement, a
                  new approach which stops
                  banks doing business with those dictators not
                  currently making headlines. This
                  must account for three key principles:
- If a bank cannot get its
                    senior
                    politician customers to explain their wealth, then
                    it should turn down the
                    money.  Senior officials should be able to explain how
                  their
                  assets were earned legitimately, especially if there
                  is a significant difference
                  between their official salary and their actual wealth.
                  If they cannot explain
                  there should be a presumption that that their funds
                  are the proceeds of
                  corruption. This concept of “illicit enrichment” is
                  already
                  recognised in international treaties such as the
                  United Nations and the Inter
                  American conventions against corruption. 
- Banks and other investment
                    managers
                    should disclose full details of state assets that
                    they manage. In a
                  dictatorship where one individual, or a small cabal,
                  exercises almost complete
                  power over the state, there is a very thin dividing
                  line between state and
                  personal investments. For example, it appears that
                  Gaddafi has significant
                  personal control over the state funds invested in the
                  Libyan Investment
                  Authority. These funds may look like they belong to
                  the state but are actually
                  under the effective personal control of a ruler who
                  has captured the state. The
                  citizens of countries such as Libya
                  have a right to know where state funds are being held
                  and what they are being
                  spent on.   
- Such measures should be
                    accompanied by
                    national registries that list the ultimate owner or
                    controller of companies and
                    trusts. Corrupt politicians hide their identity, and
                  therefore their
                  assets, behind complex webs of front companies and
                  legal structures. This can
                  make it very difficult for banks, or law enforcement,
                  to find out who actually
                  controls assets.  
“A new
                  approach is need to tackle corruption and dirty
                  money. This isn’t just about fast cars and luxury
                  yachts. It’s what
                  allows dictators to stay in power beyond the wishes of
                  their people. Even if
                  banks are technically compliant with the law, they are
                  hiding behind regulatory
                  failings to continue their profit-driven dirty pact
                  with corrupt
                  tyrants,” said Lawson.

London ",Climate Week in turmoil over revelations of sponsor's climate damage,Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS)  ,United Kingdom,,,,"
A nationwide initiative to promote awareness and action on climate change has been thrown into turmoil following revelations over the destructive climate impact of one of its main sponsors - the Royal Bank of Scotland. A number of campaign groups including PLATFORM, Friends of the Earth Scotland, People & Planet and the World Development Movement have published a report on the opening day of Climate Week that examines in detail RBS's provision of finance to the coal sector.
The report, ‘Dirty Money, Corporate greenwash and RBS coal finance,' shows that in three years , RBS was involved in providing finance worth nearly €8 billion to the worlds biggest coal mining and coal power generating companies - more than any other UK bank. Coal is the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel, and reduction of its use is widely regarded by environmentalists as one of the most important steps in dealing with climate change.
RBS has been targeted by environmentalists for some years over its record of being the UK bank most heavily involved in financing the fossil fuel sector, so its association with the Climate Week initiative has been highly controversial, prompting some groups and celebrities to withdraw their endorsements.
Alastair McGowan, comedian and impersonator who has decided to withdraw his endorsement of the event said:
""Climate Week is celebrating the successes of ordinary citizens and businesses in bringing down their carbon emissions at the same time as its main sponsor, RBS, is doing more than any other bank to undermine those self same efforts.  It's high time RBS put its money where its mouth is, and stops bankrolling the fossil fuel industry.""
Mel Evans from campaign group PLATFORM, and one of the report authors said:
""For RBS to cynically appropriate the language around climate change action as a means of detracting attention and criticism from the promotion of climate destructive industries and practices is totally reprehensible. You can't pretend to be part of the climate solution while you are involved in providing almost €8 billion to the coal industry.""
Climate Week has also generated a lot of online controversy. A substantial proportion of tweets about the event are about the RBS sponsorship, while an online poll carried out by campaigning group People & Planet has been satirising the Climate Week Awards by inviting people to vote for the Greenwash Coup of the Year 2011. A number of groups have confirmed that they will be hosting events targeting RBS's fossil fuel finance as part of Climate Week.

Notes
The report ‘Dirty Money: Corporate greenwash and RBS coal finance' was co-published by PLATFORM, Friends of the Earth Scotland, the World Development Movement, People & Planet, Rainforest Action Network, Scottish Education and Action for Development, Indigenous Environmental Network, Public Information Research Centre, BankTrack and the New Economics Foundation.
The report can be downloaded from: www.platformlondon.org/dm.pdf
RBS was involved in providing finance worth a total of €7.99 billion to the world's 20 biggest coal mining companies and 20 biggest providers of coal-based electricity from 2008 to 2010 inclusive. The figure was calculated using a Bloomberg terminal that enables financial professionals to monitor and analyse real-time financial market data movements. Figures are based on reporting by banks to Bloomberg, but may be incomplete due to undisclosed proprietary banking relationships.
Using the same Bloomberg system, it is possible to rank all of the major banks in the world that have provided finance to the same companies listed. For the 20 largest coal companies, RBS was ranked 8th out of 35, with HSBC ranking 10th, and Barclays 29th. For the 20 largest coal-based electricity generators, RBS was ranked 3rd, with Barclays coming 4th and HSBC 11th out of 69.

United States ",U.S. Taxpayer-Funded Bank Should Follow the Doctor's Orders on Coal in South Africa,,,Kusile coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,South Africa,"
Any day now, the United States' export credit agency, the U.S. Export-Import
Bank (Ex-Im), is expected to decide on whether or not it will help finance
the construction of one of the world's largest coal plants. Located in
South Africa, the 4800 MW behemoth, known as Kusile, would be the size of about
10 typical coal plants in the US. On top of the tens of millions of tons of climate polluting gases it would
spew out every year, Kusile would create a public health nightmare for poor
South Africans living in already overly polluted areas. That explains why Dr.
Paul Epstein of the Center for Health and the Global Environment at Harvard
Medical School has weighed in.
Dr. Epstein knows the true costs of coal. He is the lead author of a new
study published in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences: ""Full Cost Accounting for the Life Cycle of Coal.""  Earlier this month, Dr. Epstein wrote to Ex-Im,
""Based on the conclusions of our study, we believe that
all hidden costs in the life cycle of coal must be included in deliberations
concerning investments in new coal based projects. I strongly urge the US
Ex‐Im Bank to make a decision based on the consideration of the full
costs of coal to society when considering project financing for the Kusile
project.""
As Dr. Epstein writes, financing coal is far more expensive and far more
damaging to our health than current coal prices would suggest.
""In the study, I along with 11 colleagues, quantify the
hidden human health and environmental impacts of coal, from mining to transport
and combustion in coal power plants, and the air and water waste stream that
accompanies these life cycle stages. We concluded that, in the United States
(with a focus on Appalachia) that the life cycle effects of coal cost the U.S.
public a third to over one‐half trillion dollars annually.""
South African activists know this all too well. As I wrote on The Huffington Post last month, they have been
pressing Ex-Im not to finance Kusile. Climate change arguments aside, they've
argued forcefully that Kusile would have devastating health and financial
consequences for South Africa's people. Instead, Kusile would be a boon for
large multinational corporations that receive some of the world's cheapest
electricity; these corporations' profits leave South Africa while their
pollution remains.
Like Dr. Epstein and South African human rights and environment defenders,
groups in the US deeply question Ex-Im's potential involvement in this
boondoggle. As a US taxpayer-backed institution, Ex-Im must live up to
its own policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as to congressional
mandates to increase support for renewable energy. If its board of directors votes
to finance Kusile, Ex-Im's fossil fuel binge will worsen and any chance of
Ex-Im meeting Congress's direction that 10 percent of financing go to
environmentally beneficial exports will be lost.
But it's not too late. Ex-Im could do the right thing -- both morally and
economically. The board of directors can -- and should - decide not to finance
Kusile. I urge you to weigh in with them. "

Tokyo, Japan ",Development Bank of Japan key financier of nuclear industry,,,,,,"
Development Bank of Japan (DBJ)  has provided 1.4 trillion yen (roughly 17.2billion US$) to 9 major electric power companies in Japan at the end of March 2010. As one third of electric energy in Japan coming from nuclear power plants, it means almost 470 billion yen (5.7 billion us$) of DBJ's money has been spent for constructions and operations of nuclear power plants around Japan. Therefore, we can call DBJ ""Japan's No1 nuclear bank"".
According to financial statements of 9 major electric power companies in Japan including struggling Tokyo Electric Power Company(TEPCO), total amounts of their long-term lending are 4.7 trillion yen (roughly 60.2 billion us$). In addition, they have issued corporate bonds over 12 trillions yen, but major holders of those huge bonds are not disclosed in the financial statements of electric power companies.
DBJ has been transferred from government own bank to  privatized one in 2008, but all of their stocks have been still owned by Japanese government. On the other hand, they have developed the environmental friendly lending rating system for corporations.
Next major lenders to electric power companies are life insurance companies such as Nihon Life Insurance, Sumitomo Life Insurance, Daiichi Life Insurance and Meiji-Yasuda Life Insurance. Total amount of these 4 major insurance lenders are nearly 1 trillion yen. They are also major shareholder of each of electric power companies. Therefore they should also be called "" nuclear insurance companies"".

Nijmegen ",‘Nuclear banks no thanks’ coalition demands banks to stop financing nuclear energy,BNP Paribas ,France,,,,"
In light of the deepening Nuclear Crisis in Japan, the ‘Nuclear banks, no thanks' coalition issued the following statement:
""Today our thoughts and concerns are with the Japanese people, who instead of being able to concentrate on recovering from the devastating earthquake and tsunami, are now forced to deal with a new man made crisis caused by nuclear power stations running amok.
The unfolding nuclear disaster in Japan has shattered all claims of nuclear proponents that nuclear energy is a safe and reliable source of energy. The events should also be a warning to any bank investing in the nuclear sector of the huge risks they run in doing so.
""The dramatic situation at multiple nuclear reactors at once proves that nuclear reactors are a dirty and dangerous power source, and will always be vulnerable to the potentially deadly combination of human error, design failure and natural disaster"" said Jan Beranek, Head of Greenpeace International Nuclear Campaign.
BankTrack and partners reject the claim that the world needs nuclear power to combat climate change. The choice between nuclear and fossil fuel as the source of energy for the future is a false one. The coalition urges banks to stop financing nuclear energy and fossil fuels and to support energy efficiency and renewable energies development, as part of an urgently needed energy revolution.
Recently, banks have been invited to finance a number of nuclear projects in countries where the nuclear industry has been trying to gain some space, after it lost much of its power and markets in the US and the EU during the previous decades.
The Jaitapur nuclear power plant project , on the west coast of India is planned in an area crossed by three tectonic faults, with potential earthquakes able to reach seven on the Richter scale. The project faces strong protest of local communities, with hundreds of people arrested by Indian authorities. The Angra III nuclear power plant project In Brazil  raises similar concerns, with no risk analysis carried out in its planning. The project is widely opposed by Brazilian environmental groups.
As the disaster continues, nuclear investments will suffer another hit, as nuclear energy policies around the work are urgently being reviewed. In Europe, Switzerland and Germany already suspended nuclear power plants approvals and life-extension processes. Chancellor Angela Merkel said ""the events in Japan have taught us that something, which all scientific data suggested to be impossible, could become a reality after all"". Reports also indicate that India's nuclear investment dreams are being threatened with some banks deciding not to participate in the Jaitapur project.
""If banks ever needed another argument why being involved in financing nuclear energy is a inherently risky business, the Japanese disaster delivers it to them. Any bank still fuelling the nuclear industry with their loans and investments should read the writing on the wall and make a turnaround, away from nuclear, towards renewable energy"", says Yann Louvel, energy coordinator of BankTrack.
For more information on bank exposure to the nuclear sector please visit www.nuclearbanks.org

  The coalition is a cooperation effort of civil society groups aimed at exposing and halting the involvement of commercial banks in the nuclear sector. It  includes, amongst others; BankTrack, Greenpeace International, Greenpeace France, Les Amis de la Terre (France), Urgewald (Germany), Antiatomszene (Austria), CRBM (Italy), WISE (Netherlands) and the Nuclear Information and Resource Service (United States)
  http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/energyrevolution/#2
  Banks that have been approached to finance Jaitapur are BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Crédit Agricole, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, JP MorganChase, Natixis, Santander, Société Générale and Standard Chartered. See: http://www.banktrack.org/show/dodgydeals/jaitapur_nuclear_power_plant

Washington, DC ",Financial analysts downgrade nuclear power,,,,,,"
""Standard and Poor's warned clients that the risk of cancellations 
or delays for existing and future nuclear projects has increased as a 
result of the situation in Japan."" (See Reuters.)
""'The severe nuclear incident in Japan has put a global nuclear 
renaissance into question,' Bernstein International analyst Alex Barnett
 said in a research note."" (See The Globe and Mail.)
""Bank Of America Merrill Lynch's Steve Fleishman cuts ratings on 
Entergy Corp. (ETR) and Scana Corp. (SCG) to underperform from neutral: 
 ‘While the Japan nuclear event has implications for all U.S. nuclear 
plants  the risk of delay or higher cost as part of approvals
 for new nuclear plants (SCG, Southern Co. (SO)) as well as relicensing 
of existing plants (ETR); public concern on nuclear plants located in 
earthquake-prone areas (PG&E Corp. (PCG), Edison International 
(EIX)); and overall higher costs for non-regulated nuclear plants 
(Exelon Corp. (EXC)), which the owners have to absorb. NRG Energy Inc. 
(NRG), however, could benefit from increased potential that new nuclear 
goes away.'""  (See Wall St. Journal.)
""BMO Capital Markets' Michael S. Worms cuts Entergy to market perform
 from outperform:   ‘Relicensing approval of Vermont Yankee by the 
Vermont legislature has long been in question; however, we believe 
concerns relative to the nuclear issues currently facing Japan could be 
the final blow.' (See Wall Street Journal.)
""Some industry analysts, however, have already begun predicting the 
(South Texas Project) expansion's demise - and are describing it as a 
favorable financial prospect for NRG.  Others say the Japanese disaster 
is practically irrelevant. ‘This almost doesn't change the fact that new
 nuclear looks to be a bad investment,' said Paul Fremont, a managing 
director at Jeffries and Company, an industry analyst. ‘Constellation 
(Energy) walked away and said keep your loan guarantee, it's not 
economic to build.'  (See Chron.com.)
""Given the lower overall probability of  
(expansion),' UBS Utilities said in an analyst report Monday, ‘we see 
positive implications for NRG shares.' Others think ongoing efforts to 
stop the expansion from being licensed could prevail.  (See San Antonio.)
""Analysts at Moody's said the Japanese nuclear problems create 
‘uncertainty' for the NRG expansion project, but abandoning the project 
would be a positive for the company due to uncertainty over its cost."" 
(See Reuters.)
""For NRG Energy we think the potential added pressure could be the 
end of its nuclear loan guarantee award from the Department of Energy 
for STP (units) 3 and 4 in Texas which could cause a write-off in the 
short term, but would be likely positive in the long-term,' Barclays 
wrote in a note to clients.""  (See Reuters.)
Palisades Hudson Financial Group:  ""... the fact remains that any 
accident at a nuclear power plant carries the risk of catastrophic 
long-term consequences. There are many other ways to generate 
electricity, and none of them create the potential for cataclysm, or the
 need to quarantine their byproducts for centuries.If we honestly 
accounted for the true costs of nuclear power, there is a very good

Paris ",Le gouvernement britannique reconnaît officiellement les violations des droits humains sur l'oléoduc BTC,Belfius ,Belgium,Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline ,oil and gas,Azerbaijan,"
 

En avril 2003, une plainte avait été déposée par six organisations environnementalistes et de défense des droits humains, dans le cadre de la construction du très controversé oléoduc Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC). Huit ans après, le gouvernement britannique vient de rendre sa décision (1), déclarant que le consortium d'entreprises, mené par la compagnie pétrolière BP et dans lequel participait la française Total, a violé les normes internationales concernant les responsabilités des entreprises multinationales en termes de droits de l'Homme. Cette décision vient conforter la campagne internationale de la société civile, et prouve que les normes sociales et environnementales des multinationales restent nettement insuffisantes, tout comme celles des nombreuses institutions financières internationales (Banque Mondiale, BERD), agences de crédits à l'exportation (dont la Coface) et banques privées (dont BNP Paribas, Société Générale, Crédit Agricole, Natixis et Dexia) qui avaient financé le projet.
Les villageois habitant le long de l'oléoduc BTC ont lutté pendant des années pour que les entreprises multinationales soient tenues responsables des violations présumées des droits humains dans le cadre du développement de ce projet. L'oléoduc, de 1760 km de long, achemine près d'un million de barils de pétrole par jour depuis la mer Caspienne, au travers de l'Azerbaïdjan et la Géorgie, jusqu'à la Turquie d'où partent des pétroliers géants vers l'Europe. La récente décision du gouvernement britannique fait suite à la plainte portée en 2003 par six organisations (2) : elle reconnaît que le consortium mené par BP a violé les Principes Directeurs de l'OCDE à l'intention des Entreprises Multinationales, car il n'a pas su enquêter et répondre aux plaintes des communautés locales - notamment Kurdes - qui souffraient d'intimidation par les forces de sécurités nationales en Turquie, chargées de surveiller l'oléoduc. Par exemple, Ferhat Kaya, défenseur des droits humains, a déclaré avoir été détenu et torturé par la police paramilitaire pour avoir insisté pour recevoir de justes compensations. La plainte argumentait que de telles intimidations avaient empêché les populations locales de participer aux consultations organisées par BP, concernant le tracé de l'oléoduc et les négociations des compensations pour les pertes de terres et de moyens de subsistance.
Malgré les alertes lancées très tôt par de nombreuses organisations de la société civile, la construction de l'oléoduc BTC a été terminée en 2006 grâce au soutien financier de nombreuses institutions, notamment la Banque Mondiale, la Banque Européenne de Reconstruction et Développement (BERD), et, en France, la Coface et les banques privées BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole, Société Générale, Natixis et Dexia (3). Certaines avaient érigé le projet comme un exemple de succès et de mise en application modèle des Principes d'Équateur, engagement volontaire censé être garant d'un respect des plus hauts standards environnementaux et sociaux (4). Juliette Renaud, chargée de campagne sur la Responsabilité des acteurs financiers aux Amis de la Terre France commente : ""La décision rendue par le gouvernement britannique montre bien que la ""due diligence"" exercées par les institutions financières, qu'elles soient publiques ou privées, est bien insuffisante et ne permet pas de prévenir les atteintes graves aux populations et à l'environnement. Ces institutions doivent prendre davantage au sérieux leurs responsabilités avant de financer de tels projets controversés, et prévoir des sanctions en cas d'abus avérés"".
Étant donné l'engagement juridiquement contraignant du consortium mené par BP, d'assurer que le projet BTC soit conforme aux Principes Directeurs de l'OCDE, la décision du gouvernement britannique place potentiellement l'entreprise en infraction de ses contrats avec les principales institutions financières internationales (IFI) qui ont financé le projet avec l'argent des contribuables en 2004. Selon Nicholas Hildyard de The Corner House, une des organisations ayant déposé la plainte : ""Les institutions financières publiques étaient au courant des intimidations, mais ont manqué de vérifier si BP disposait de procédures adéquates pour s'en occuper et y remédier. Malgré cela, elles se sont quand même lancées dans le projet pour des raisons politiques. Les gouvernements occidentaux semblent avoir été prêts à sacrifier les droits humains des populations vivant le long de l'oléoduc afin d'accaparer le pétrole de la mer Caspienne.""

San Fransisco ",EuroSibEnergo’s Hong Kong IPO threatens rivers of Siberia and Lake Baikal,Credit Suisse ,Switzerland,En+ Group ,energy plants - coal | energy plants - dams,Russian Federation,"
An international
coalition of NGOs for the protection of transboundary rivers, Rivers without
Boundaries, has presented evidence of undisclosed environmental risks to
investors in advance of EuroSibEnergo's IPO on the Hong Kong
stock exchange. The report presented on the International Day of Action for
Rivers exposes the environmental risks associated with EuroSibEnergo's plans to
use the proceeds from its IPO to build two mega dams in the fragile river
system in Siberia, including those connected to the protected Lake Baikal,
the largest freshwater system in the world.
BankTrack
members Pacific Environment and International
 Rivers are calling on
investors to consider the report compiled by Rivers without Boundaries, which
outlines the major environmental, social and political risks of the proposed
hydropower projects. It also brings to EuroSibEnergo's poor environmental track
record to light. In the past, the company's systemic failure regarding basic
environmental management and corporate social responsibility practices has
meant that its investors had to bear the burden of significant environmental
fees and fines. These risks have not been adequately disclosed in
EuroSibEnergo's listing documents.
The
international NGO community is very concerned about the impacts of
EuroSibEnergo's projects on the fragile Lake Baikal
ecosystem -a UNESCO World Heritage Site -; the region's surrounding
biodiversity and local communities.
""Large hydro in Siberia and in the Russian Far East compromises
communities and ecosystems and is certainly not a ‘sustainable alternative
renewable energy source,'"" states Leah Zimmerman, Interim Executive Director of
Pacific Environment.
""There are many excellent untapped alternatives for truly green
energy in Russia,
including solar and wind.  Investors should not be fooled into thinking
that hydropower in the Lake Baikal region is an alternative or sustainable
investment for meeting Russia and China's energy needs,"" added Zimmerman.
 Pacific
Environment and International
 Rivers are deeply
concerned about EuroSibEnergo's disregard for environmental protection laws and
apparent desire to construct these hydropower projects at any cost.
 ""Investors
should shy away from a company that hides so much information about
environmental risks in its closet as EuroSibEnergo does. The company's
destructive dam projects will not only damage the integrity of Lake Baikal
but also the reputation of its investors,"" says Grace Mang, Program Coordinator
at International Rivers. "

Potsdam, Germany ",New Report on human rights violations by dams in Turkey,,,Ilisu dam ,energy plants - dams,Turkey,"
A new
report by organisations from Germany
and Turkey
reveals the huge extent to which Turkish dam policy violates human rights. The
report was submitted to the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights yesterday, on the International Day of Action against Dams. The
committee will consider at its next session in May 2011 the Turkish
government's compliance with its obligations under the International Covenant
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The Covenant constitutes binding law
and inter alia prohibits to deprive people of their livelihoods.
   „For the first time the impacts of large dams are assessed from a strict human
rights point of view"", states Heike Drillisch, author of the report and
coordinator of CounterCurrent, the Ilisu Campaign in Germany. „As the Turkish
government has ratified the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in
2003, it is obliged to drastically change its dam policy.""     In their report the groups conclude that the Turkish government violates
numerous rights covered by the Covenant, including those to food, water,
housing and health. The study analyses Turkish legislation such the laws on
expropriation and resettlement and some environmental laws as well as several
cases including the Ilisu
dam, for which the German, Austrian and Swiss governments had granted
export cover from 2007 to 2009, dams in the Coruh and Munzur valleys as well as
the Yortanli dam, which in February 2011 submerged the antique spa Allianoi,
and the impacts of a small hydro-electric power plant in Southwestern Turkey.
The report also gives special attention to the situation of nomads, whose
culture is under great threat from the construction of dams, and the right to a
healthy environment.     „The Turkish government plans the construction of approximately 2,000 dams and
hydro-electric power plants in addition to existing 2,000 ones without any
assessment of their cumulative impacts on the entire country"", states Engin
Yilmaz, Director General of the Turkish nature organisation Doga Dernegi. „The
implementation of these plans would not only cause environmental destruction on
an unprecedented scale, but also massively violate of the rights of up to two
million people.""     „All the dams that have been constructed to date show the same pattern: there
is no meaningful participation of the affected population, compensation levels
are not sufficient to restore livelihoods, and income restoration programs have
not been created"", states Ercan Ayboga, international spokesperson of the
Initiative to Keep Hasankeyf Alive. „This constitutes a severe violation of Turkey's obligations
under the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and we hope that the
Committee will make it unmistakably clear to the Turkish government that this
is unacceptable.""     On occasion of the International Day of Action Against Dams and for Rivers,
Water and Life actions took place all over the world to raise awareness of the
severe impacts of dams on humans and the environment. In Turkey actions took place in Istanbul,
Rize, Izmit, Antalya,
Batman, Sirnak and Tunceli. In Spain,
activists have alerted the shareholders attending the Annual General Meeting of
BBVA, a major
Spanish bank, to the fact that through its Turkish partner bank Garantibank BBVA is supporting the destructive Ilisu dam.     The report Dam construction in Turkey and its impact on economic,

Despite
their internal arms policy and their adherence to Corporate Social
Responsibility policies, the Centro de Estudios por la Paz J.M.
Delàs, Observatorio de la Deuda en la Globalización (ODG) and the
Federation SETEM, united in the campaign ""BBVA without arms""
announce in BBVA's Annual General Assembly of Shareholders that
since 2006, BBVA has actively financed and invested over 1,000
million euros in companies producing
nuclear weapons, cluster bombs and depleted uranium weapons.
(Madrid,
Friday, March 11) .- The campaign ""BBVA without arms,""
composed by Centro de Estudios por la Paz J.M.
Delàs, Observatorio de la Deuda en la Globalización (ODG) and the
Federation SETEM has participated this morning in Bilbao for the
third consecutive year in BBVA´s Annual General Assembly and
provided concrete information to the Board of Directors of BBVA and
its shareholders on their continued relationship with controversial
weapons producers, such as nuclear weapons, cluster bombs and
depleted uranium weapons, among others.
In
spite of the dialogue established between the campaign ""BBVA
without arms"" and BBVA, the existance of BBVA´s internal policy
on the defense sector and the sale of their participation in the
syndicated loan to Lockheed Martin in 2010, the NGOs of the ""BBVA
without arms"" campaign revealed BBVA Group's continued
presence in companies that manufacture
controversial weapons.
The
information presented today in Bilbao has been obtained from a report
that will be released in SETEM´s upcoming
campaign work. The report reveals that BBVA Group participates in
loans, assists in bond and share issuances and manages investments
funds which hold shares and bonds of 16 controversial weapons
producers worth over 1,000 million
euros since 2006.
This
information unveiled today by ""BBVA without arms"" contradicts
BBVA´s internal policies on Human Rights and the defence sector as
well as with their adherence to Corporate Social Responsibility
initiatives, such as the UN Global Compact, UN Principals for
Responsible Investment (UNPRI) and the Global Reporting Initiative.
Despite
these commitments, the BBVA Group finances and invests in companies
producing controversial weapons such as BAE Systems, Boeing, EADS,
Finmeccanica, General Dynamics, Honeywell, ITT Corporation, Jacobs
Engineering, L-3 Communications, Larsen & Toubro, Northrop
Grumman, McDermott International, Rolls Royce, Thales and Textron.
The latter built the cluster bombs used in the Iraq War. BBVA
underwrote an issuance of shares owned by Finmeccanica for the amount
of $ 78 million in October 2008, 2.01% of these shares in name of the
Libian Investment Authority, whose weapons were probably used in the
repression of civilian population of this country over the past
weeks.
The
campaign ""BBVA without arms"", formed of the Centro de
Estudios por la Paz J.M. Delàs, Observatorio de la Deuda
en la Globalización (ODG) and SETEM, brings to light the
relationship of banks with the arms industry. "

These
were two of the many slogans of the Platform against Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA) who held a protest in Bilbao on 11 March
2011 Friday between 10.00 and 12.00. The officials of BBVA, who would
hold their Annual General Meeting (AGM) in the Euskalduna Palace, did
not let Akgün İlhan, an activist of the Initiative to Keep
Hasankeyf Alive, to join the AGM by inventing various bureaucratic
excuses. For this reason Jordi Calvo Rufanges, an activist of
Barcelona Peace and Justice group, made a speech in the name of the
Initiative to Keep Hasankeyf Alive talking about the proposed Ilisu
Dam and the destruction it will lead to, and asking BBVA - who
recently bought 25% of the shares of Garantibank, one of the three
financial organisations behind the construction of the controversial
Ilisu project - to withdrew from the Ilisu project.  Meanwhile, two
activists of the Platform against BBVA were protesting the
investments by this bank with armament and other social-ecological
destruction projects such as the Ilisu dam by pouring red paint over
themselves symbolizing the blood of the peoples and individuals
suffering from the actions of BBVA. The police immediately handcuffed
and arrested them while the demonstrators of the Platform against
BBVA responded applauding, whistling and chanting slogans ‘your

Tasmania ",Environment groups’ response to Federal Minister Burke’s decision on Gunns’ pulp mill,,,Tamar Valley Pulp Mill Tasmania (formerly Gunns Pulp Mill) ,forestry - pulp and paper,Australia,"

Environment groups
today acknowledged the constructive progress on plantation wood supply in
Minister Tony Burke's legally-binding conditions for the proposed pulp mill,
but expressed fundamental concerns about unaddressed community opposition to
the mill and the mill's marine impacts and reiterated their opposition to the
project.
""We are opposed to
this project but we do welcome the Minister's legally-binding decision to
require the pulp mill to only use wood from plantations,"" said Lyndon Schneiders from The Wilderness Society.
""It means it is
illegal for the proposed pulp mill to ever use native forest timber and we
recognise this is a step forward. Locking out the use of native forests is a
welcome development, though outstanding issues remain with this project.
""A pulp mill needs
to be supplied from a Tasmanian plantation resource base that
is sustainably managed and of a scale acceptable to local
communities,"" Mr Schneiders said.
""We are deeply
concerned about the potential impacts the ocean disposal of industrial process
effluent will have on Tasmania's marine environment, fisheries, and coastal
amenity and believe this was the wrong decision,"" said Dr Thomas Moore from
Environment Tasmania.
""We do recognise
and welcome tougher standards and the improvements to some of the environmental
benchmarks set for the marine effluent, but will have to now have the
opportunity to fully assess the complex marine modelling data associated with
this decision to be able to make further assessment of these proposed changes,""
he said. 
""Despite the
welcome improvements, much community opposition remains,"" said Don Henry from
the Australian Conservation Foundation.
""It is now up to
the company, along with the state and federal governments, to embark on a
legitimate, independent and transparent process, with public participation, to
assess the impacts of a pulp mill development in the Tamar Valley. 
We are committed to a resolution of the forest conflict in Tasmania,"" Mr Henry said. "

UK ","BP violating human rights rules, says UK government",,,Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline ,oil and gas,Azerbaijan,"
A BP-led consortium is
breaking international rules governing the human rights responsibilities of
multinational companies in its operations on the controversial
Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, the UK Government ruled today. 
 Environment and human rights groups, which had filed an official complaint against
BP eight years ago, say the ruling puts the oil multinational in breach of its
loan agreements -- including a multi-million pound loan backed by UK taxpayers.
  Villagers living along BP's flagship oil pipeline have struggled to hold the
companies accountable for alleged human rights abuses associated with its
development. The pipeline brings up to one million barrels of oil a day from
the Caspian Sea, across Azerbaijan
and Georgia, to Turkey
from where supertankers ship it to Europe.   The ruling follows the Complaint lodged under the OECD Guidelines for Multinational
Enterprises by six groups in April 2003. The UK Government backed the
pipeline in 2004 through its Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD).   The ruling states that BP failed to investigate and respond to complaints from
local people of intimidation by state security forces in Turkey guarding the
pipeline. Local human rights defender Ferhat Kaya, for instance, has reported
that he was detained and tortured by the  paramilitary police for insisting on fair compensation. Villagers allege
that they are routinely interrogated when they raise concerns over the
pipeline.   The pipeline passes through an area of north-east Turkey with a substantial Kurdish
minority who have been subject to state repression for decades. Since the
pipeline's inception over a decade ago, human rights campaigners in Turkey and the UK have highlighted the risk of
local people, particularly Kurdish minorities, being intimidated by state security
forces. Today's ruling has found that, despite widespread awareness of this
""heightened risk intimidation"", BP failed adequately to respond to or
investigate allegations of abuse that were brought to its attention.   The Complaint argued that such intimidation deterred local people from participating
in BP's consultations about the pipeline's route and compensation negotiations
for loss of land and livelihoods.
 BP has consistently promoted the BTC pipeline as ""world class"" in its
approach to human rights. According to its legally-binding commitment to comply
with the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights (an international
code of conduct for multinationals operating in the energy sector), BP is
obliged to ""consult regularly"" with local communities about the
impacts of pipeline security arrangements and should record and report credible
allegations of abuse by security forces to the authorities.   The UK Government has now found that BP breached its undertaking and failed to
adhere to the Voluntary Principles in the north-east region of Turkey by not
responding adequately to allegations of intimidation and not investigating
them.   The ruling sets a major precedent. In future, to comply with these corporate
social responsibility guidelines, multinationals will have to take into account
the human rights  context in which they
operate, including the risk of intimidation, when designing and implementing corporate
grievance mechanisms. Such mechanisms need to be robust enough that people can
report intimidation without fearing further reprisals.   Given BP's legally-binding commitment to ensure that the BTC project complies
with the OECD Guidelines, today's ruling from the UK government potentially
places the company in breach of its contracts with the major international
financial institutions (IFIs) that backed the project with taxpayers' money in
2004. In addition to the UK's export credit agency, these include the
International Finance Corporation of the World Bank, the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and other European and US export credit
agencies.   The failure of BP to adhere to the OECD Guidelines and the Voluntary Principles,
as required under the BTC project agreements, also raises major concerns over
the due diligence undertaken by the IFIs before supporting the pipeline.   Nicholas Hildyard of The Corner House says:   ""Public funders knew about the intimidation, but failed to check whether BP
had adequate procedures in place to address and remedy it. They ploughed ahead
with the project anyway for political reasons. Western governments appear to
have been willing to sacrifice the human rights of those living along its route
in order to grab the Caspian's oil for the  West.""    Rachel Bernu of Kurdish Human Rights Project says:   ""It has taken eight years for the claims of villagers facing repression in
this isolated area of Turkey
to be recognised.  We hope this ruling marks a turning point for the
governments and companies involved so that villagers receive just compensation
and human rights are not only respected but also promoted through investment in
future.""   James Marriott of Platform says:   ""This ruling shows that BP's pipeline allowed and enabled repression of local
communities. Yet EU governments and companies continue to push for new
pipelines to suck oil and gas westwards from distant places of extraction. BTC
stands as a warning that these planned 'energy corridors' risk becoming
'corridors of militarisation and human rights abuse'.""   Craig Bennett of Friends of the Earth says:   ""Using taxpayers' money to support this pipeline at the expense of people's
human rights and the planet is a stain on the UK's reputation. The pipeline would
not have been built without public funding. Government ministers must now come
clean about what action they will take against BP for breaching its loan
agreement. The only way to stop this cycle of  exploitation is to wean us all off our fossil fuel dependency by investing in
the safe, clean and ethical technologies of the future.""   Commenting on the ruling, Nick Dearden of Jubilee Debt Campaign says:   ""This long-awaited ruling underlines the need for urgent changes in the UK's export
credits system. Empowering British companies to violate the national laws of
other countries goes against the most basic form of social and environmental
responsibility. Without effective safeguards, projects like BP's one are bound
to happen again.""   Peter Frankental of Amnesty International UK adds:   ""The UK Government's condemnation of BP for breaching internationally recognised
human rights standards on the BTC pipeline begs the question of why taxpayers'
money, in the form of export credit guarantees, was used to fund such a project
in the first place. If such support had been withheld until BP had addressed
the human rights context of their pipeline project,  then these violations might never have occurred. It is time the UK's Export
Credits Guarantee Department was reformed to prevent this from ever happening
again.""   The ruling gives BP three months to review and report on what it can do to strengthen
its procedures to address these failings.

The 1,760 kilometre-long Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline runs from
the offshore oil fields near Baku in Azerbaijan through Georgia to the Turkish
port of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean. A consortium of oil companies, led by
British oil multinational BP, built the pipeline from May 2003 onwards,
completing it in 2006, although negotiations and  preparations had started back in the late 1990s.   Map: http://www.bakuceyhan.org.uk/pics/agt_map.jpg   Its construction and financing provoked major concerns regarding its social,
environmental, development and human rights impacts.   - Local people who protested were allegedly threatened by consortium and national
government officials.  - Before and during construction, the pipeline violated more than 170 World
Bank and European safeguards.  - Poverty alleviation benefits are questionable and the potential for exacerbating
social divides high.  - The Host Government Agreements between the consortium and the countries supercede
all national laws (except the national constitution) and effectively exempt the
pipeline from any improvements in environmental and human rights legislation.

Brazil ",Regional judge overturns ban on construction of controversial Belo Monte dam in the Brazilian Amazon,,,Belo Monte dam ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"
Brasília,
              Brazil - In yet another turn of events in the increasingly heated legal
          and
          political battle over the controversial Belo Monte dam
          complex, on
          Thursday the president of a federal regional court in
          Brasilia,
          Olindo Menezes, overturned a decision by federal judge Ronaldo
          Destêrro that prohibited initial construction to commence on
          the
          mega-project - slated to be the world's third largest dam -
          along
          the Xingu river in the heart of the Brazilian Amazon.
""There
          is a real danger that bureaucratic delays and procrastination
          in the
          Brazilian legal system may contribute to Belo Monte becoming a
        fait
            accompli,
          which would be a death sentence for the Xingu and its people,""
          said
          Brent Millikan, Amazon Program Director at International
          Rivers.
The
          earlier decision by Destêrro, issued on February 25th, was
          provoked
          by a civil lawsuit filed by the Federal Public Prosecutor's
          office. The lawsuit argued that the federal environmental
          agency, IBAMA had
          acted illegally in issuing a ""partial installation license""
          -non-existent under Brazilian law- to allow construction to
          begin
          on access roads, industrial parks and worker encampments at
          two sites
          of the Belo Monte dam complex. The lawsuit noted that the
          majority
          of social and environmental pre-requirements for dam
          construction to
          begin, such as health, education and sanitation infrastructure
          in
          urban areas and demarcation and protection of indigenous
          lands, had
          not been complied with by the Norte
            Energia (NESA) dam-building consortium, headed by parastatal energy
          company,
          Eletrobras.
In
          his decision, regional judge Menezes used
          a legal artifice (""suspensão de segurança"") that
          dates to the military dictatorship of the 1970s, allowing for
          previous decisions to be overturned without considering the
          merits of
          the case, based on arguments of supposed threats to national
          security. According to Menezes, there
          is no need for full compliance with conditionalities of a
          first phase
          environmental license for ""initial installations"" of Belo
          Monte to begin.
The
          Public Prosecutor's Office stated that the decision by Menezes
          was
          reckless and, if upheld, will lead to irreparable damage to
          the
          environment and population of the Xingu region. According to
          public
          prosecutor Felicio Pontes, ""in all phases of the licensing
          process, the federal government has disrespected the Brazilian
          constitution and environmental laws. IBAMA has ceased to be a
          technical agency and today cedes to political pressures,
          becoming the
          main party responsible for deforestation in the Amazon.""
          According
          to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the beginning of dam
          construction at Belo Monte may provoke chaos in terms of
          social
          infrastructure in the region of Altamira. It is estimated that
          8,000
          people have already migrated to the city of Altamira in search
          of
          employment at the dam site. The federal government estimates
          that a
          total of 100,000 people will migrate to the region as a
          consequence
          of Belo Monte, and that some 32,000 will remain after
          construction is
          completed.
In
          response to the decision by the regional judge, the Movimento
Xingu
                  Vivo para Sempre (MXPVS), a coalition of indigenous people, social movements and other
          civil
          society groups opposed to the Belo Monte dam, stated ""How
          can this government call itself democratic and popular while
          resorting to subterfuges created by the military
          dictatorship?""
          According to MXVPS coordinator Antônia Melo, ""the decision by
          the
          regional court judge is scandalous, but there will be a
          reaction from
          social movements and others that defend the rule of law.""
The
        Public
                Prosecutors Office has already announced that it will appeal the decision by
          Menezes. Nine other lawsuits regarding the Belo Monte dam
          complex are also
          pending.
The
          risky $17 billion Belo Monte Dam will divert nearly the entire
          flow
          of the Xingu River along a 62-mile stretch. Its reservoirs
          will flood
          more than 120,000 acres of rainforest and local settlements,
          displace
          between 20,000 and 40,000 people and generate vast quantities
          of
          methane-a greenhouse gas at least 25 times more potent than
          carbon
          dioxide.

Bangladesh ",Massive protest rally against mines in Phulbari & Barapukuria,,,Phulbari coal mine ,mining - coal ,Bangladesh,"
 
At least 2,000 demonstrators blockaded
a major highway in northwest Bangladesh this week to protest
government plans for open pit coal mining in Phulbari and nearby
Barapukuria and demand compensation for lost crops and the
destruction of their lands.
 
Demonstrators called on the
government
to honor a six-point agreement signed on August 31, 2006. The
agreement bans open pit coal mining throughout Bangladesh, and calls
for the permanent expulsion of the Phulbari Mine Project's
financier, Global Coal Management (formerly Asia Energy), from the
country.
 
Demonstrators also demanded long-term
compensation and rehabilitation for crops and lands damaged by land
subsidence around the Barapukuria Coal Mine.
 
The protest rally and blockade on
February 28, 2011 began at 11:00 am and stranded some 500 passenger
buses and vehicles on both sides of the highway for an hour.  It was
organized by Bangladesh's National Committee to Protect Oil, Gas,
Mineral Resources, Power and Seaports.
 
If protestor's demands are not met by
March 27, they intend to organize a six-hour road and rail blockade
on the highway linking Barapukuria and Phulbari on March 28.
 
Lessons Learned from the Barapukuria Coal Mine
 
Barapukuria is an underground coal mine
located approximately 10 miles from Phulbari.
The severe environmental, social, and
political problems caused by the Barapukuria mine should serve as a
powerful warning to backers of the proposed Phulbari Coal Mine
Project.
 
The 2,500-acre underground mine
includes 650 acres of agricultural land on the surface.  Mining
operations at Barapukuria have destroyed roughly 300 acres of land,
with devastating impacts on at least 2,500 people in seven villages
thus far. Land subsidence of over one meter in depth has destroyed
crops and lands and damaged homes so severely that many are no longer
inhabitable.
 
There are recent reports of hunger
among affected households.  People in 15 villages have lost their
access to water, as huge quantities of water pumped out for the
Barapukuria mine caused a rapid drop in water levels.  The water
level is now too low to be accessed by normal tube wells that these
households depended on for water prior to the mine.
 
Government officials acknowledge that
the number of people affected by land subsidence in Barapukuria will
continue to grow, with mine operations expected to cause over four
square kilometers of land to sink by two meters over time.
 
Victims of land subsidence are seeking
compensation and repair of their homes.  However, the Daily Star, a
leading Bangladeshi newspaper, reports that the mine's operator,
Barapukuria Coal Mine Company Ltd (BCMCL), has proposed building and
resettling them in eight to ten ""tin sheds"".
 
Faced with resistance by people in
Barapukuria, Towfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, the energy adviser to the
prime minister, announced that the government was considering plans
to establish a ""Coal City"" near Barapukuria, which would
provide housing and new sources of livelihood for victims of land
subsidence.
 
According to Towfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury,
the resettlement of people whose homes have been destroyed is to be
carried out in phases.  The Coal City would initially be designed to
provide homes and livelihoods for 10,000 families, but may ultimately
expand to 100,000 families.
 
It is unclear what the new sources of
livelihood will be for thousands of farming households whose lands
have been destroyed once they are resettled in Coal City.  However,
in light of government assurances that they will minimize the
acquisition of agricultural lands when acquiring lands to build the
Coal City, we can expect that few if any of these households will be
able to resume farming.
 
It is also unclear where or how lands
sufficient to ultimately house as many as 100,000 people will be
found in Bangladesh, one of the most densely populated countries in
the world.  This raises a critical question: will the lands for the
resettlement of people displaced by the Barapukuria mine be acquired
through more forced eviction?
 
Fatal Disasters
 
The devastating environmental impacts
and human toll caused by mining in Barapukuria strongly support
concerns that have been raised by Global Coal Management's
aggressive efforts to establish an open pit coal mine in the
neighboring township of Phulbari - despite the strong and sustained
opposition to the proposed project and the company.
 
Similarly, recurring accidents
resulting from technical failings at the Barapukuria mine raise
serious concerns about worker safety -- as well as Bangladesh's
current capacity for exercising the regulatory oversight and
enforcement needed to safely establish and operate what experts agree
would be a technically challenging mine at Phulbari.
 
Accidents at Barapukuria began with a
major disaster during the development phase, when underground water
flooded the original shaft in the late 1990s and stalled the mine's
progress for months.  Since coal production began in 2005, there have
been a series of fatal and near-fatal accidents, including the death
of a British mining expert caused by inhaling poisonous gases, a gas
leakage accident in 2005 that required the closing and sealing off a
portion of the mine with equipment valued at one million dollars
trapped inside, and most recently, a roof cave-in on May 11, 2010
that killed one worker and wounded 19 people.
 
Engineers report that government policy
makers have failed to heed their warnings about inadequate health,
safety and environmental provisions in the Barapukuria mine, with
some stating that standard safety procedures are virtually
non-existent at the mine.
 
Recurring accidents and the devastating
impacts of land subsidence at the Barapukuria mine confirm that it is
time to listen to the experts' warnings regarding the proposed open
pit mine at Phulbari: catastrophic environmental consequences are
likely if the government approves plans for a technically challenging
project aimed at extracting coal that is buried at depths of up to
300 meters.
 
The political and social risks are
equally severe.  Three people have already lost their lives and
hundreds have been wounded in Phulbari in the fight to protect their
homes and lands from the devastation suffered by their neighbors in
Barapukuria.  Despite the use of violence against them, people
threatened by the Phulbari mine have vowed to continue their fight.

Vienna, Austria ",Profits through destruction - The other annual balance of Andritz,,,Belo Monte dam ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"
„We at
ANDRITZ are committed to sustainable development. For ANDRITZ, sustainable
development encompasses a full set of environmental measures but at the same
time goes beyond them.""
„The
ANDRITZ GROUP is committed to promoting environmental protection and
conservation of natural resources."" 
On March 8th the
Austrian company Andritz will present its financial balance for 2010. The
company's CEOs will talk a lot about gains in business and record profits. What
will not be presented is the price that had to be and will have to be paid by
the ecosystems and affected people in the project regions.
ECA Watch Austria took a
look at Andritz' socio-ecological balance of 2010. „Andritz' balance in terms
of numbers and money may be good for the company, but the real balance for
people and nature is disastrous. Andritz has become one of the most ruthless
companies in its area of business. They participate even in projects  that are abandoned by competitors,"" said
Ulrich Eichelmann from ECA Watch Austria.
Andritz'
socio-ecological balance based only on the company's three biggest projects
Ilisu dam (Turkey), Belo
Monte and dams along the Rio Madeira (both Brazil):
-        
Displacement
of 85.000 to 100.000 people1
-        
Elimination
of 100 to 150 species2
-        
Destruction
of 210.000 hectares of unique landscape3
-        
Destruction
of the antique city of Hasankeyf and other areas
of significant cultural heritage along the Tigris
river
These
numbers represent low estimates, a) because of the overall limited knowledge
about species populations in affected areas, b) because they only include the
directly affected people, not those who are effected downstream of the dam by
the reduced water flow, the deterioration of water quality etc. and c) because
not all of Andritz' projects could be included in this evaluation due to lack
of project information.
In terms of
the most disastrous projects one would have to add the ""Bell Bay
pulp mill"" project in Tasmania/Australia, which is is on halt at the moment due
to ongoing protest by environmental groups in the region. According to project
plans, the installation and operation of this pulp mill would swallow 200.000
hectares of native forest and would produce 64.000 cubic meters of wastewater per
day which would be led into the ocean, endangering nearby marine species.
For the
company's reputation 2010 was a special year. The list of opponents has
significantly grown: human rights, environmental and church organizations
protested against Andritz. Demonstrations took place in Austria, France,
Turkey, Tasmania
and Brazil.
The NGOs BankTrack and Les Amis de la Terre (Friends of the Earth France) put
Andritz on a black list of companies which should be excluded from ethical
funds.
Andritz
more ruthless than other companies
Andritz
even participates in projects when other companies pull out on ethical grounds.
In the case of the Ilisu project in Turkey for example, where European
governments and banks withdrew from the projects and even Andritz' partners in
the building consortium pulled out, Andritz remained in the project. After a
two year examination the governments of Germany,
Austria and Switzerland had
suggested the halt of the project. The European banks and construction
companies followed the instruction, except Andritz.  Instead, they proudly announced in mid-2010
their ""biggest contract in history."" (Andritz Hydro News No 18).
In
September 2010 Andritz received bad news. The Bell
Bay pulp mill project in Tasmania was stopped and
a several-hundred-million-Euro deal for the Austrian firm was put on halt.
At the
beginning of 2011 Andritz signed the contracts for the Belo Monte project in Brazil. Their
shares increased in value, but this was no good news for the people and the
nature in Amazonia. ""Andritz' statements on
the company's website concerning its sustainability policies appear quite
cynical facing the reality on the ground. Andritz should create and follow
social and ecological standards for their work in order to limit their negative
impact on people and environment and to stay reliable,"" concluded Ulrich
Eichelmann.

San Fransisco, Hongkong ",Groups call on Hong Kong exchange to ensure Zijin Mining comes clean about overseas investment risks,,,Rio Blanco Copper Mine ,mining - non coal,Peru,"

Several civil society groups today petitioned the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to ensure that Zijin Mining Group (listed as 2899:HK) fully discloses material risks associated with one of its most controversial overseas projects, the Rio Blanco Mine in Peru.
The groups include Friends of the Earth, Peruvian rights organizations CooperAccion and Fundación Ecuménica para el Desarrollo y la Paz (Fedepaz), and Belgian solidarity organization CATAPA.
""Because of the Rio Blanco Mine project, people have lost their lives, and the fragile ecosystem and waterways of the Piura region are being threatened by pollution,"" said Javier Jahncke of Fedepaz.  ""This has not only affected the health and lives of the people, but also economic activities such as eco-tourism, agro-industry and organic farming, which are the main sources of sustainable development in the region.  The danger of losing their international organic farming certification is among the gravest risks looming over Piura communities.""
The letter raised concerns that Zijin investors are in the dark about the risks posed by the Rio Blanco Mine project, including the company's failure to obtain community authorization before beginning mining activities, as required by Peruvian law, lack of compliance with Peruvian environmental regulations, and torture and killing of local people.  Despite these controversies, Chinese media reported in 2010 that Zijin hoped to secure financing to expand the Rio Blanco Mine over the next couple of years.1
""Zijin's mismanagement of social and environmental issues at the Rio Blanco mine may be indicative of a broader governance problem at the company,"" said Adina Matisoff of Friends of the Earth U.S.  Last year, the company's own Supervisory Committee found that the company may have overstated the value of some of its assets because of ""problems  from the social and environmental protection in local society, higher political, economic and cultural risk for overseas investments.""  However, Zijin's 2009 annual report disclosed neither these risks nor how the company was addressing them.
""The Hong Kong Stock Exchange has issued state-of-the-art disclosure standards for mining companies,"" Matisoff added, ""but standards to protect investors and the public interest are useless if the Exchange does not properly enforce them.""
Chinese environmental groups have already urged the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to ensure that Zijin properly reports on the financial implications of its July 2010 Zijinshan spill in Fujian, one of China's worst mining accidents harming the environment in recent history. Since the incident, the company has halted trading on the Exchange numerous times in advance of announcements about fines and penalties associated with the event.
""Increased disclosure gives investors greater confidence and helps with the risk management and transparency of their portfolios,"" said David St. Maur Sheil, Executive Director of the Association for Sustainable and Responsible Investment in Asia (ASrIA).  ""Asria has seen a steady increase in the quantity and quality of environmental, social and governance disclosure by Asian companies in recent years and it is clear that institutional investors increasingly take account of corporate disclosure and engagement standards when making portfolio decisions.""
A copy of the letter to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange is available here: http://www.foe.org/sites/default/files/Letter%20to%20HKSE%20re_Zijin.pdf ###
CooperAcción is a civil, non-profit organization dedicated to promoting development in coastal areas and exploitation of mineral and energy resources in Peru. It aims to contribute to striking the right social and environmental balance between the use of natural resources and sustainable development.
FEDEPAZ is a partnership, nonprofit organisation that promotes an ecumenical perspective, respect for fundamental values in the Peruvian society. In particular, those relating to life, liberty, justice, equity and sustainable human development.
Friends of the Earth U.S. is a member the world's largest federation of environmental organizations, Friends of the Earth International, with groups in 76 countries.  For more than 15 years, Friends of the Earth U.S. has promoted sustainability in the financial sector in the U.S. and around the world, including proper disclosure of environmental issues to investors.
CATAPA (Comité Académico Técnico de Asesoramiento a Problemas Ambientales) is an emerging volunteer movement in Belgium active in the fields of globalization (and how to change it) and sustainable development in Latin America. They focus on the mining industry by supporting farming communities endangered by multinational mining corporations.
ASrIA (Association for Sustainable and Responsible Investment in Asia) is a not for profit, membership association dedicated to promoting corporate responsibility and sustainable investment practice in the Asia Pacific region.  For the past ten years, ASrIA has encouraged increased disclosure on environmental, social and governance issues in investment.  ASrIA's members include investment institutions managing over US$4 trillion in assets; however membership is open to any organization which has an interest in sustainable investment. 1.

Australia, Tasmania ",Environment groups’ statement on delay to pulp mill approval,,,Tamar Valley Pulp Mill Tasmania (formerly Gunns Pulp Mill) ,forestry - pulp and paper,Australia,"
Environment groups have welcomed Environment Minister
Tony Burke's decision to delay his decision on the pulp mill proposed for
Tasmania's Tamar Valley, as the company behind the proposal, Gunns, is ""seeking
tougher environmental controls than were contained in the original
application"".
""The current proposal for the pulp mill, put forward
by Gunns in 2007, would cause unacceptable damage to the environment, so it is
appropriate that the Minister give the company longer to improve its proposal,""
said Lyndon Schneiders, Campaign Director for The Wilderness Society.
""Modern ‘world's
best practice' pulp mills don't damage oceans and rivers, are supplied by wood
from well managed plantations and gain a ‘social licence' through legitimate
public consultation and transparent processes,"" said ACF executive director Don
Henry.
""Environment groups have long campaigned on a number
of major environmental impacts from the proposed mill, including the plan to
source timber from native forests and potential risks to the marine
environment, air pollution and water use,"" said Dr Phill Pullinger, Director of
Environment Tasmania.
""We would certainly welcome any and every opportunity
for stricter environmental controls to be placed on this proposal, but will
have to reserve any judgement until we see the final decision,"" Dr Pullinger
said.
""It is a important precedent for a company to seek
tougher environmental controls for its own project, showing the company is
heading in a positive direction,"" Lyndon Schneiders said.  "

In order to bring extra attention to the petition, a number of the banks were visited by a funeral procession, symbolically carrying out a funeral for coal.At every bank that was visited on the route of the funeral procession, a priest read an elegy to the financiers who had supported the departed coal industry, followed by a symbolic burial. The signatures of the Bankroet petition, in the form of a book of condolence, were presented to the representatives of the banks, together with a memento in the form of a lump of coal. As the ceremony progressed, the mood turned to relief, and even euphoria, at the death of coal. The ceremony was accompanied by the band Jaune Toujours, who ensured that the procession became triumphant. People passing by, and curious bank employees, were handed a copy of the death announcement.Banks play an important role in the promotion of coal power, by providing investment and loans. Research conducted by Netwerk Vlaanderen (""Bankers on hot coals"") revealed that the investigated banks invested at least €18.5 billion in E.ON, RWE and Vattenfall in the period 2008-2009. These energy companies have based their strategy in the construction and operation of coal-fired power stations. Deutsche Bank (€7.4 billion) and BNP Paribas (€6.2 billion) head the list.In 2009, Deutsche Bank also gave a loan for the construction of coal-fired power station that will emit 5.2 million tonnes of CO2 each year. This is equivalent to the annual emissions of 1.7 millions cars. In 2008 BNP Paribas participated in a loan to GDF Suez, intended for the construction of a new coal-fired power station in Chili. The power plant will have a production capacity of 150 mW, which would create CO2 emissions of 860,000 tonnes per year - equivalent to the annual emissions of 286,000 cars.The organisations supporting the action are encouraging the banks to move towards more climate-friendly investments, in the first place by ending their investments in coal power. The high level of emissions from coal means that it has a particularly destructive impact on the climate. Frank Vanaerschot: ""This funeral is symbolic, but it remains an absolute priority to put an end to the use of coal as a source of energy. Banks play an important role in this, and they must understand that investments in dirty coal power are destroying our chances of preventing dangerous climate change. We invite them to say a final farewell to coal.""The funeral ceremony at the entrance to the banks - and the hand-over of the petition - marks the end of the ""Bankroet"" petition organised by Netwerk Vlaanderen, KWB, Greenpeace Belgium, WWF Belgium, Bond Beter Leefmilieu and Friends of the Earth Flanders & Brussels. As well as containing the signatures of 4,000 individuals, the action is also supported by 11.11.11, Netwerk Bewust Verbruiken, LETS Vlaanderen and JNM     "

London ",Son of Equatorial Guinea’s dictator plans one of world’s most expensive yachts,Bank of America ,United States,,,,"
Global Witness has learned that Teodorin Obiang,
the notorious son of Equatorial Guinea's long-ruling dictator, commissioned
plans to build a superyacht worth $380 million - almost three times more than
his energy-rich country spends annually on health and education programs
combined . This news comes amid an increasingly heated debate about how
Middle Eastern dictators and their family members have enjoyed luxury
lifestyles, as well as stashing their assets in foreign countries.
Teodorin (full name Teodoro Nguema Obiang
Mangue) asked Germany's
Kusch Yachts to draw up a basic design for the secret project, which is codenamed
""Zen."" Last year, Global Witness revealed details from a U.S. Justice
Department investigation into Teodorin which mentioned plans to build a yacht. After
discovering that it was to be built at Kusch's shipyard in northern Germany,
a Global Witness investigator visited the company and obtained key details
about the project, confirming the identity of the client, and the yacht's price
tag. The vessel's basic design was completed by Kusch in December 2009 for
€250,000 ($342,000) with an original delivery date set for late 2012. However,
construction has not yet started.
The Obiang regime has a long track record of
looting money that belongs in Equatorial Guinea's
treasury. Global Witness has previously revealed Teodorin's profligate
lifestyle in the US
and elsewhere with a $35 million dollar Malibu
mansion, a fleet of luxury cars and a private jet, while earning a ministerial
salary of $6,799 per month . It would take him some 4,600 years to pay for
Project Zen on his reported official salary.
""Evidence points to corruption by Teodorin on a
scale that would not be possible or attractive if countries like Germany and the U.S.
were not safe havens, in terms of free passage for him and for his questionable
private wealth,"" said Gavin Hayman,
Director of Campaigns at Global Witness. ""$380m is a staggering sum - that a
President's son from such a poor country has ordered this yacht is outrageous
extravagance on his part,"" added Hayman.
Teodorin's father, Teodoro Obiang Nguema
Mbasogo, took power in 1979 following a bloody coup and presides over a
repressive government almost entirely dependent on energy revenues generated by
ExxonMobil, Marathon
and other multinational giants and has one of the worst human rights
reputations in the world . Obiang came eighth on a 2006 list by Forbes of
the world's richest leaders with a fortune estimated at $600 million, whilst
the majority of Equatorial Guinea's
people live in poverty .
Incredibly, since oil was discovered in the
mid-1990s, poverty levels have actually worsened. Equatorial Guinea
enjoys a per capita income of about $37,900, one of the highest in the world. Yet
77 percent of the population falls below the poverty line, 35 percent die
before the age of 40, and 58 percent lack access to safe water .
Forty-one-year old Teodorin is the Minister of
Agriculture and Forestry and vice president of the ruling party, and is
apparently being groomed to succeed his father. A US
embassy cable from March 2009 posted by Wikileaks describes how Teodorin was
given a significant tract of pristine jungle to log, leaving him with a ""large
windfall"". The author of the cable paints a picture of a nepotistic state where
choice natural resource concessions are handed out to the President's family
and close associates. Responding to corruption allegations, Teodorin told the US
official: ""I've been very lucky in business  and I like to live well""
.
According to the Justice Department
investigation Teodorin funneled roughly $75 million into the United States
between 2005 and 2007 through three European banks -- Banque de France, Natixis
and Fortis -- and then on to the U.S. through Wachovia (later bought by Wells
Fargo), Union Bank of California, and Bank of America . Global Witness
questioned what checks these banks had done on Teodorin's funds; they could not
comment on this.
 ""t is suspected that a large portion of
Teodoro Nguema OBIANG's assets have originated from extortion, theft of public
funds, or other corrupt conduct,"" says a Justice Department document dated 4
September 2007. The document relates to a preliminary investigation; as yet no
charges have been filed .
Kusch employees who spoke with Global Witness'
investigator said that Teodorin's yacht will be 118.5 meters (387 feet), housing
a cinema, restaurant, bar, swimming pool and a $1.3 million security system
complete with floor motion sensors, photoelectric barriers and fingerprint door
openers. Teodorin reportedly met a representative of Kusch at a hotel in Switzerland
to discuss the design.
Its total contract price is approximately €288
million, or $380 million at current exchange rates. This would make it the
world's second most expensive yacht, behind Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich's
$1.2billion Eclipse . England's
Tim Heywood, one of the world's most renowned yacht designers, produced the
drawings for Project Zen. Heywood's previous designs include the 377-foot
Pelorus, which served as the blueprint for Project Zen and is also owned by
Abramovich.
""Kusch's motto is, ‘we don't just build yachts
that you use, we create a dream that you live'. But this sounds more like a
nightmare for Equatorial Guinea's oppressed and brutalized citizens, whose
money may once again be put to Teodorin's benefit rather than theirs,"" said Hayman.
""The yacht company involved should refuse his cash and repudiate any
involvement in the project. In addition, this order should raise loud alarm
bells for whichever bank handles this transaction.""
Kusch confirmed to Global Witness that Teodorin
was a client, but would not give further details ""for reasons of
confidentiality"". Tim Heywood declined to comment.
The Information and Press Bureau of the
Government of Equatorial Guinea confirmed that Teodorin had ordered the design,
while adding that he ""then dismissed the idea of buying it"". The spokesperson
claimed that if the order had gone ahead Teodorin ""would have bought it with
income from his private business activities and he would not in any case have
bought it with funds derived from sources of illegal financing or corruption"". She
clarified that in Equatorial Guinea
""there are no legal restrictions prohibiting public figures from taking part in
private lucrative activities"" .
Some countries, such as the U.K.,
require luxury goods dealers including yacht builders to abide by anti-money
laundering rules. Like banks, they have to monitor their customers for
suspicious activity and report doubts about dirty money to the authorities. Global
Witness is calling on Germany
to implement similar regulations. In addition, Germany
should work with EU member countries to produce mandatory revenue payment
disclosure laws for extractive companies, such as those required by the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Finance Reform Act. The Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI) conference hosted by President Sarkozy in Paris
next week would be a good place to start this process.

London ",Don’t make it easier for dictators to steal,Barclays ,United Kingdom,,,,"
This comment piece by Anthea Lawson, the head of Global Witness's Kleptocracycampaign, was published in the Financial Times on 24th February 2011
The world may belatedly be waking up to the damage
done by a financial system that allows corrupt heads of state to hide loot in
respected foreign banks. Wednesday's calls for the seizure of the Gaddafi
family's assets have come far too late for
those Libyans now on the streets enduring the regime's brutality. Last week saw
a similar scramble to locate fortunes believed to be held by Hosni Mubarak in
foreign banks. Switzerland froze
the former Egyptian leader's assets and Vince Cable, the UK business
secretary, called on his government to follow suit. Reports suggest that Mr
Mubarak was able to shift his money to friendly Gulf
 states even as protesters called for his resignation in Cairo's Tahrir Square.
Switzerland has also frozen the funds of Zein al-Abidine
Ben Ali, the former Tunisian
president, as has the European Union. France has opened an investigation into assets linked to
Mr Ben Ali.
Discussion has so far centred on how this money might be returned to the
countries it came from to benefit ordinary people and promote economic
development. But the real question is, what was the money doing in banks in France and Switzerland in the first place? If
there is enough evidence of corruption to freeze Mr Mubarak's or Mr Ben Ali's funds now that they have been forced from office, why was it not sufficiently
obvious at the point when they were accepted?
Anti-money laundering laws are designed to identify
criminal money entering the financial system, whether from corruption,
organised crime or terrorism. Banks are required to do ""due diligence"" on their
customers; they must identify those who are senior officials or their family
members and associates - ""politically exposed persons"" or PEPs in the jargon -
and subject them to more stringent checks. Those who potentially have access to
state funds are deemed to present a higher risk.
The frozen Mubarak and Ben Ali money has been
collecting in European banks that are required to do such due diligence. What
questions did these banks ask about the money they were accepting? Did they
reassure themselves that it had been legitimately earned?
One of Global Witness's recent reports shows how
corrupt Nigerian funds, siphoned off by two former state governors, was held in
London bank accounts at HSBC, Barclays, NatWest, RBS and UBS. This was
happening between 2001 and 2005: that is several years after the Abacha
scandal, when it became clear that $1.3bn of the former Nigerian dictator's
funds had come through 23 London
banks. The Financial Services Authority privately reprimanded the banks
involved in the Abacha case, although there were no public statements. Nor it
is clear that any action has been taken regarding the state governors case. This
softly-softly approach has been as hopeless for money-laundering standards as
it was for prudential regulation.
 
In the cases Global Witness examined, funds were later
returned to Nigeria.
But the damage is done at the point when money is diverted from its intended
public use. If banks were not willing to accept looted funds in the first
place, corruption would not be possible on the scale too often seen.
Now is the right time to be talking about this. In Paris this week, the
little-known but influential Organisation of Economic Co-operation and
Development body that sets the global anti-money laundering standard is
meeting. Best known in recent years for blacklisting financial centres such as
São Tomé and Príncipe, Turkmenistan and Iran in response to pressure from
the Group of 20 leading economies, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is
considering changes to the rules.
Some of the proposals are excellent, such as ensuring
that tax evaders and those who advise them and bank their money can be
prosecuted for money laundering. But the FATF wants to remove officials'
""family members and associates"" from the list of those on whom banks must
perform extra checks. To make this suggestion is to misunderstand graft.
Corrupt rulers do not just distribute money to family members and cronies in
order to help launder it; this is part of their means of staying in power.
Banks may not be under enough pressure to implement
the existing standard properly, but that is no reason to water it down.

London ",Protests outside treasury over RBS oil investments,Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS)  ,United Kingdom,Canadian tar sands ,oil and gas,Canada,"
As bailed-out bank RBS publishes
details of its 2010 financial results, campaigners call on the government to
cure RBS of its high-risk oil addition. RBS's results show that it is still not
making a profit and today's (24 February) stunt in London highlights the unhealthy investments
of an unhealthy bank.
Campaigners from Friends of the
Earth Scotland and the World Development Movement are urging the government, as
majority shareholder in the bank, to use its power to switch the investments of
the Royal Bank of Scotland away from climate-damaging fossil fuels and instead
to finance much-needed low carbon industries.
At the Treasury, campaigners
delivered over a thousand postcards signed by taxpayers angry at the Government
for letting RBS use their money to finance projects and companies that are
worsening climate change and threatening human rights.
A campaigner dressed as an RBS
banker, addicted to fossil fuels, lay 'unconscious' on the pavement outside the
Treasury this morning, having overdosed on oil while another dressed as a
doctor tried to cure the banker of his oil addiction.
RBS is the UK bank that has been
most heavily involved in financing the global coal industry and companies
mining tar sands in Canada.
Since being bailed out in October 2008, RBS has provided finance of nearly
£3.6bn in direct loans to fossil fuel companies and has helped raise equity
finance worth an additional £9.3bn. Of this £13bn, just over £1bn has financed
companies involved in tar sands mining.
Campaigners argue that the
government should be turning RBS into a Royal Bank of Sustainability or a Green
Investment Bank in order to finance low carbon transition in the UK and kick start a green jobs revolution in the
UK.
RBS was bailed-out with a total £45.5bn of taxpayers' money and the bank is now
83% owned by the Government. Despite its majority shareholding, the Government
has refused to intervene to switch RBS's lending practices away from
destructive projects like tar sands and into low carbon, green energy. Mary
Church of Friends of the Earth Scotland said: ""People don't want a
profitable RBS at the expense of human rights and the environment. Instead of
simply lining the pockets of bankers, a Royal Bank of Sustainability could
serve the interests of both taxpayers and the environment, by financing a just
transition to a green economy.""
Liz Murray of the World Development
Movement said: ""There is growing anger among the public that the
government is allowing RBS to continue investing taxpayers' money in companies
pushing environmentally and socially devastating projects such as tar sands
mining in Canada and Madagascar. These
are unhealthy investments from an unhealthy bank. The Chancellor must step in
and protect the taxpayers' shareholding by ensuring that RBS finances green
growth not climate change.""
Canadian tar sands extraction has
been described as the most destructive industrial project on earth, producing
carbon emissions three times larger than conventional oil and creating
devastating impacts on indigenous communities and the local environment.
In Northern Alberta, an area the
size of Wales,
has been stripped bare and rivers polluted by the tar sands extraction. Similar
excavations are also being investigated in a UNESCO World Heritage Site
containing undisturbed forests and mangrove swamps in Madagascar.

Washington, DC ",Financial speculation tax introduced,,,,,,"
Friends of the Earth announces strong support for Rep. Pete Stark's proposed financial transactions tax
An idea gaining popularity around the world -- placing a miniscule tax on financial speculation in order to fund urgent priorities -- has come to the United States in the form of legislation introduced in Congress today by Representative Pete Stark (D-Calif).
The legislation, called ""The Investing in Our Future Act of 2011"" 
(H.R. 755) would place an extremely small tax (0.005 percent) on 
currency transactions of more than $10,000 in order to generate funding 
to address climate change and reduce the federal budget deficit. Bill 
sponsors estimate that the micro-tax could generate about $5 billion per
 year.
""This bill is a win-win proposition-it will tax Wall Street 
speculation while generating funds that we can use to pay down the debt 
and respond to the climate crisis,"" said Michelle Chan, director of 
economic policy at Friends of the Earth. ""The United States is 
responsible for more climate pollution than any other country, and this 
proposal would help us meet our moral obligation to assist poor 
countries as they respond to climate change impacts. We appreciate the 
leadership Rep. Stark is showing by introducing this measure, and urge 
other members of Congress to cosponsor and support it.""

Paris ",BNP Paribas releases new policy on nuclear financing,BBVA ,Spain,Angra 3 nuclear power plant ,energy plants - nuclear,Brazil,"
With 13.5 billion euro investments in the nuclear industry between 2000
and 2009, BNP Paribas is the n°1
nuclear bank in the world. BNP Paribas just published its new
policy on the financing of nuclear power plants, subjecting its loans to nuclear
power projects to specific conditions.
BNP Paribas recently also announced its participation in the financing
of the Angra
3 nuclear power plant in Brazil.
Friends of the Earth France would like to remind BNP Paribas that nuclear energy
cannot be considered in any way as a solution to climate change. FoE France also
points out the numerous flaws of BNP Paribas' policy. 
The new policy on the financing of new nuclear power plants of BNP Paribas is
presented as an integral part of its ""commitment to sustainable
development"". But the continuous support of BNP Paribas to the atomic
industry is in stark contrast with the most elementary principles of
sustainable development and respect for the communities.
BNP Paribas' new policy suffers from many flaws. For example, none of
its prerequisite requirements include the guaranteed independence of the host
country regulatory body, the inclusion of elements ensuring the effective
implementation of waste management, the preparation of decommissioning plans,
or effective measures to protect workers' health.
Furthermore, this policy only covers a portion of the nuclear industry -
power plants -, and does not apply to investment or asset management
activities, while the issuing of shares and bonds includes more than 50% of the
nuclear sector financing.
These flaws are clearly illustrated by the recent announcement by BNP
Paribas of its participation in the financing of the nuclear power plant Angra 3 in Brazil, this in a joint
venture with Société
Générale, Crédit
Agricole and CIC and the Spanish banks BBVA and Santander. Many
NGOs, including BankTrack and FoE France, have been warning these banks for
months on the dangers of this project. These include the use of obsolete
technology and a neglected analysis on safety and accidents prevention. Also, one
can strongly put the independency of the CNEN (Brazilian regulatory body) into
question, due to the inbuilt conflict of interest.
Numerous problems also arise for the Jaitapur
project in India,
which is now considered for financing by BNP Paribas and other French and
European banks.
As Juliette Renaud, the financial actors' responsibility campaigner of FOE France, stated: ""This new policy does not
address neither the consent nor even the consultation of local communities,
which will nonetheless be the first affected and which mobilisation can be
severely and violently repressed, as happened recently in India on the Jaitapur
project"".
Contrary to what BNP Paribas states, the nuclear sector is becoming less
and less profitable, so much so that it is beginning to lose ground. Today, it
contributes to only 13% of electricity production worldwide, which is less than
2.5% of the final consumption demand in the world (less than 14% in France).
However, as Marie-Christine Gamberini, the nuclear and energy campaign
responsible for FoE France,
reminds us: ""As we approach the 25th anniversary of the Tchernobyl catastrophe,
the most important brake to the development of the nuclear technology should be
its intrinsic dangers, worsened by its vulnerability to extreme climate events.
The privatisation of the energy sector and the growing use of subcontracting
continue to increase the risks of catastrophes, even in France.""
These are also reason for FoE France to demand the immediate closure of
the oldest and less reliable French reactors, the end of electronuclear in one
or two five-year election periods, and the end of the selling of French nuclear
power plants abroad (1).
Juliette Renaud concludes: ""To cope with current environmental and social
issues, banks like BNP Paribas should adopt a comprehensive sectoral policy on
the energy sector, including sub-sections for every domain (nuclear, coal, oil,
agrofuels, etc.) instead of separating the sectors as they now do. This would
guarantee a better coherence and would avoid leaving some key energy sectors
uncovered."" Private banks have indeed a major role to play in the
reorientation of industrial activities towards a low carbon economy, with no
radioactivity, and more respectful to people and their environment. Notes:

Brazil ",Dam-affected people deliver half a million signatures calling on Brazil's President Dilma to stop the Belo Monte Dam,,,Belo Monte dam ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"

Brasilia, Brazil - Over half a million people, most of
them Brazilians, are calling on newly-elected President Dilma to halt plans to
construct the Belo Monte Dam. Outside the Brazilian Congress and Presidential
Palace this morning, several hundred people gathered in protest including
indigenous chiefs in full tribal regalia and community leaders from the Xingu
River Basin, and delivered the petition signatures to the Dilma Government.
A delegation of leaders
went inside the Presidential Palace around noon to present the petition, among
them were Kayapó chiefs Raoni Metuktire and Megaron Txucarramãe from Mato
Grosso state; Chief Ozimar Juruna from Paquicamba village in Altamira; Josinei
Arara, leader of the Arara village in Altamira; Sheyla Juruna, a leader of the
Juruna people; and Antonia Melo, coordinator of the Movimento Xingu Vivo para
Sempre.
""This is a life and
death struggle,"" said Sheyla Juruna, one of the delegates who met with the
Office of the President. ""By pushing forward with this dam, the Dilma
government is trampling on our rights. This is not just about defending the Xingu River,
it's about the health of the Amazon rainforest and our planet.""
Opposition to the dam project
is growing among diverse sectors of civil society including scientists,
politicians, dam-affected communities, environmentalists and celebrities. At
the rally today, Domingos Dutra, Labor Party Congressman from Mato Grosso and
leading member of the Human Rights Commission of Congress challenged the
government's ambitious plans to promote an archaic energy model that includes
plans for more than 60 major dams for the Amazon. Brazilian singer and
songwriter Marlui Miranda performed at the demonstration while Marcos Palmeira,
Dira Paes, Leticia Spiller and Brita Brazil
were among Brazilian artists who issued written statements opposing the dam and
calling for greener energy alternatives for meeting Brazil's energy needs.
""The Brazilian public
is sending a loud and clear message, one that is being echoed internationally
that the Dilma government needs to rethink the Belo Monte dam and opt for more
sustainable ways of meeting Brazil's
energy needs,"" said Christian Poirier, Brazil Program Coordinator for
Amazon Watch. ""The Belo Monte dam project is foolish on so many
levels-from its social and environmental impacts on our climate and on the
people and the rainforests of the Amazon to its technical and economic
viability.""
The protests were sparked
by Brazil's environmental agency IBAMA's decision on January 26 to grant a
""partial license"" despite overwhelming evidence that the dam-building
consortium Norte Energia (NESA) has failed to comply with dozens of
social and environmental conditions required for an installation license. The
decision followed the controversial resignation of IBAMA's president Abelardo
Bayma, who allegedly departed amidst intense political pressures from President
Dilma to approve the license.
While Dilma reportedly sees
the dam projects as potentially the biggest achievement of her presidency, the
controversy is fast becoming a serious challenge to her leadership and has
fueled the debate about Brazil's
energy future.
In a letter to
Dilma delivered
along with the petition signatures, more than 78 civil society organizations
called for the government to change its course for energy development for the
country, articulating 12 demands for a more participatory, socially and
environmentally just energy vision for Brazil.
""At today's
demonstrations, popular movements from the Xingu and Tapajos and Madeira rivers
called on the Brazilian government to both cancel the Belo Monte Dam complex
and take bold measures to democratize energy planning in Brazil,"" said
Brent Millikan, Director of the Amazon Program for International Rivers.
Critics strongly refute
Dilma's assertions that dams provide ""clean energy"". The risky USD
$17 billion Belo Monte Dam Complex will divert nearly the entire flow of the Xingu River
along a 62-mile stretch. Its reservoirs will flood more than 100,000 acres of
rainforest and local settlements, displace more than 40,000 people and generate
vast quantities of methane-a greenhouse gas at least 25 times more potent than
carbon dioxide.
Further casting doubts over
the project, a group of scientists issued a scientific paper this week warning that with climate
change, severe droughts such as the one currently raging in the Amazon will be
much more frequent raising serious questions about the technical and economic
viability of large dams.
The petition was
coordinated by the international online advocacy organization Avaaz. The demonstration was organized by the Movimento
Xingu Vivo para Sempre, the Conselho Indigenista Missionário (Missionary Indigenous Council), the Movimento dos Atingidos por Barragens (MAB, or Movement of Dam-Affected People), the Coordenação das Organizações
Indígenas da Amazônia Brasileira (COIAB, Indigenous Organizations
Coordination of the Brazilian Amazon), Instituto Socioambiental (ISA)
and promoted globally by Amazon Watch, International Rivers and Avaaz. "

United States ",New UBS policy fizzles,UBS ,Switzerland,Mountain top removal coal mining ,mining - coal ,United States,"
 
‘Tis the season for new bank environmental and social policies! Last Friday, UBS was the latest to announce an updated “Responsible Banking” policy. Let’s see how it stacks up.
First off, we have to commend UBS and other banks for choosing to
make environmental and social commitments public. Transparency is a
critically necessary component of responsible banking, and UBS’ move to
define certain “no go” activities also merits praise. By making these
exclusions and its broader commitments public, UBS sets a good example
for its industry peers.
That said, transparency doesn’t turn wrong into right. UBS still
finances some of the most environmentally and socially irresponsible
industries around, and we don’t expect these relatively weak
commitments to change that fact.
Frankly, many of the commitments ring hollow. One wonders why it has
taken so long for UBS to disavow financing illegal logging, for
example. At the same time, illegal logging is so prevalent in the
tropics, with more than half of tropical timber in international trade
estimated to come from illegal sources, that UBS is going to have to
greatly strengthen its due diligence procedures if civil society is
going to have any confidence in this commitment. And that will require
continuing to work closely with the civil society groups that have been
raising these issues to make implementation credible.
UBS totally misses the mark on palm oil. Practically speaking,
limiting financing to companies that are members “in good standing”
with the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil won’t limit financing at
all. “Good standing” has more to do with paying membership fees than
changing practices (more on that from Ashley’s November post).
A proper palm oil policy would suspend financing of palm oil
plantations linked to social conflict and environmental destruction.
UBS’ forest commitments also need to go farther. Avoiding clients
severely damaging High Conservation Value Forests is, of course, a good
thing. But I suspect we’d differ on which clients fall within that
description. The commitment also needs to include high carbon value
forests and peatlands, the destruction of which is a major contributor
to climate change
On energy, the new UBS policy doesn’t amount to a hill of beans. On
mountaintop removal coal mining (MTR), the bank says “we need to be
satisfied that the client is committed to reduce over time its exposure
to this form of mining.” Back in November we called this commitment “a step in the right direction.” Then came Saturday’s announcement that industry heavyweight Alpha Natural Resources would acquire the notorious Massey Energy.
And just one day after the policy announcement at UBS, guess who
advised Massey on the deal? That’s right, UBS helped to create the
largest single mountain top remover in the country, responsible for
fully 25% of coal production from MTR mines. How’s that for due
diligence!
So far, no word from UBS on what kind of linguistic gymnastics it
took to squeeze that deal through its apparently worthless MTR policy.
Prove us wrong!

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil ",Developer backing out of loan for construction of risky Belo Monte Dam,,,Belo Monte dam ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil-After learning that the Brazilian National Development Bank 
(BNDES) will not release funds from the $640 million bridge loan issued in late December 
unless Brazilian legislation is honored, the dam consortium Norte Energia, S.A. (NESA) is 
threatening to drop the loan and is now seeking private funders to finance initial 
construction on the Belo Monte Dam Complex in the Brazilian Amazon. This follows last 
week's issuance of a ""partial"" installation license-non-existent within Brazilian 
environmental legislation-by Brazil's environmental agency IBAMA, allowing NESA to 
open access roads and initiate forest clearing at dam construction sites in an area of 2,118 
acres.
 
While BNDES has publicly committed to financing 70-80% of the cost of the Belo Monte 
Dam Complex, it will not release any funds until Norte Energia, S.A. has met 40 social and 
environmental loan conditions tied to the project's preliminary license and until a full 
installation license is issued.  In frustration, NESA is seeking private funders who may be 
less concerned about conditions being met to bankroll initial construction while 
compromising indigenous and local communities, thousands of acres of rainforests and the 
Brazilian law.
 
""NESA's decision to drop the bridge loan issued by BNDES sends a pretty clear message 
that the project's legal risk is higher than analysts thought. It is a signal that NESA is not 
interested in following Brazilian federal legislation. If they are unwilling or unable to oblige 
BNDES' standard loan conditions now, there's a good chance they will also ignore 
subsequent legislated loan conditions further on, when the real costs of the project start to 
emerge. The resulting credit risk is dangerous to the bank,"" said Zachary Hurwitz, Policy 
Program Coordinator at International Rivers.
 
 
The issuance of a ""partial"" installation license by IBAMA last week, prior to addressing 
over 40 social and environmental conditions, has been decried by impacted communities, 
Brazilian civil society and the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office (Ministério Público 
Federal or MPF), which issued a record tenth lawsuit related to the hydroelectric dam after 
finding evidence that the license violated Brazilian constitutional law. BNDES has come 
under increasing scrutiny from the MPF and NGOs due to alarming evidence that approval 
is based on political rather than economic grounds, often downplaying problems of 
economic viability and compliance with social and environmental safeguards.
 
""We welcome the BNDES decision to observe Brazilian environmental laws,"" said Atossa 
Soltani, Executive Director of Amazon Watch. ""Given that the Belo Monte Dam project 
clearly violates the Equator Principles for environmental and social sustainability, we urge 
BNDES and other potential investors to reject future financing of the project.""
 
The risky USD $17 billion Belo Monte Dam Complex will divert nearly the entire flow of 
the Xingu River along a 62-mile stretch. Its reservoirs will flood more than 100,000 acres of 
rainforest and local settlements, displace more than 40,000 people and generate vast 
quantities of methane
-
a greenhouse gas at least 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
 
NOTE: Amazon Watch, International Rivers and Rainforest Foundation UK will be 
leading a delegation of indigenous leaders from Brazil and Peru impacted by BNDES 
loans to European cities from February 20-March 2. "

Woodside protests & arrests attract international attention
Last week, the campaign to protect the Kimberley coast from 
Woodside's industrialisation plans heated up when activists protested 
outside Woodside offices in Perth and Broome - resulting in two arrests. 
Our protest banner and dead whale outside Woodside's offices in Perth
The protests coincided with Woodside's hosting of a series of 
meetings with the Browse LNG Joint Venture Partners (Shell, Chevron, BP 
& BHP Billiton) to try to convince them the project is on track and 
to sign on to the next phase of the proposed James Price Point project. 
It was a crucial opportunity to show the
strong opposition that exists against the project proposed for the 
Kimberley
 Coast - one of the
world's natural wonders.
Perth Action
Around 20 people and a ‘bleeding' whale met outside Woodside 
Headquarters in St George's Tce, with banners, oil drums and whale 
tails. Two people were arrested, charged with trespassing and issued 
with ‘move on' notices after they allegedly tried to hang a banner off 
the Woodside building which said ‘Woodside, what else are you hiding?' 
Shane, one of those arrested, said:
I
 consider Woodside's pre-empting of the gas hub approvals process and 
accessing James Price Point to build roads, clear land and carry out 
drilling is trespass. If Woodside is entitled to trespass at James Price
 Point, I am entitled to trespass on their building!""
If the arrests do result in a court summons, the charges will be vigorously defended.
Broome Action
Broome residents held an ""Unwelcome Party"" at Woodside's new office 
in Broome.  The action included community members unfurling a ‘Not 
welcome' mat, toasting an ‘unwelcome' to Woodside and re-tying a red 
ribbon out the front of the office. Check out the video here!
A statement to the Joint Venture Partners: 
Woodside 'un-welcome' protest in Broome
""We wanted to ensure that representatives from Shell, BHP, BP and 
Chevron meeting in Perth were not hoodwinked by Woodside into thinking 
the James Price Point project was going well. Woodside must fully inform
 them of the very real risk that this project poses in terms of delays, 
cost overruns and damage to corporate brands.""

United States ",Keystone XL won’t decrease “unfriendly” oil imports either,,,Keystone XL pipeline ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,United States,"
Yesterday, AP reported that the proposed Keystone XL tar sands pipeline to Texas won't decrease gas prices (I broke that story last month, but who's counting). In fact, a report commissioned by pipeline sponsor TransCanada now shows that connecting tar sands producers with Gulf Coast refiners actually pushes gas prices up for everybody.
That same report contains another unreported secret: Keystone XL 
won't decrease so-called ""unfriendly"" oil imports either. According to 
the same 2008 report, if Keystone XL were completed in 2013, Gulf Coast 
""imports are forecast to decline initially before 2010... and then to 
increase by over 600,000  by 2020."" Why? Because Gulf 
Coast ""Crude runs... are projected to grow by over 500,000  by 2020."" (See chart from the report, below).
So while TransCanada's radio commercials claim that   the 
""Transcanada Keystone Pipeline  can reduce America's dependence on   oil
 from unfriendly places, like  Venezuela and the Middle East, by up to  
20 percent,"" the  company's own research shows  otherwise.
The chart below sums it up nicely. If we build XL, we'll continue 
importing just as much oil from Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and other 
""unfriendly sources,"" while dirty Canadian crudes will top off the tanks
 of expanding Gulf Coast refineries. Put another way, Keystone doesn't 
make us less dependent on dangerous sources of foreign oil, it only digs
 America deeper into a crushing dependence on an ever-dirtier, ever more
 expensive addiction to oil.

Canada ",More lies on midwestern tar sands pipeline,,,Keystone XL pipeline ,oil and gas | transport and infrastructure,United States,"
 
With
approval of his $7 billion KeystoneXL pipeline uncertain,  TransCanada CEO
Russ Girling is now saying the project has nothing to do with Canada's tar
sands. But that's not the story he's telling investors.
In an interview reported today by Lauren Krugel of the Canadian Press, CEO Russ
Girling said:
I
don't believe that there's a causal link between the two... It will be
developed responsibly, in my view, irrespective of whether we build a pipeline
or not... That oil will go someplace, so I think this push to connect somehow
the development of the keystone pipeline to the development in the oilsands is
not valid.    
That's
a very different message from TransCanada PipeLine's most recent Annual Report which states:
The
increase in WCSB crude oil exports from Alberta
requires access to new markets, including the Gulf Coast.
TCPL will continue to pursue additional opportunities to move crude oil from Alberta to U.S. markets.
So
for its investors, increasing tar sands production ""requires"" the XL
pipeline, but for the American public concerned about locking in dirty oil
imports, the two have nothing to do with one another. Which
do you believe?

San Fransisco, US ",HSBC takes a step away from tar sands,HSBC ,United Kingdom,Canadian tar sands ,oil and gas,Canada,"
This
week, HSBC became the second international bank in as many months to take a
step away from financing in the Tar Sands.
The bank hinted in press reports last year that it was
reviewing its tar sands business. Now the London-based bank has come through.
In a post to its website, the bank quietly revised its ""Energy Sector Policy"" to
clarify that:
HSBC has policy restrictions where customers are involved in the principal
processes of mining, extraction and upgrading. We undertake a balanced analysis
of positive and negative impacts to understand whether customers operate in
accordance with good practice, focusing on factual data and trends where
available. Specifically, we analyse: GHG intensity; water usage; land and
tailings pond reclamation; the grievance process in place for local
communities; and the extent to which a customer discloses standards and
performance.
For the bank ranked 13th among
tar sands financiers last year by RAN, it ain't perfect. The new policy lacks
any timelines, targets, or definitions. And the devil's always in those
details.
You have to wonder, for instance, about that ""GHG
intensity"" commitment. Last year the banking giant underwrote $625 million in
bonds for TransCanada. TransCanada is now facing a slew of lawsuits and
regulatory hurdles over its proposed ""Keystone XL"" tar sands pipeline to Texas.
In a request to delay approval of the pipeline, the EPA
issued concerns that the product it would carry is 
82% more GHG-intensive than conventional crude.
The ""local communities"" commitment also raises
questions. HSBC  raised $100 million in bonds for Enbridge last year.
Enbridge is the company working with Chinese oil companies to push the
""Northern Gateway"" tar sands pipeline through the heart of the Great Bear
Rainforest to a tanker port in Northern British Columbia. More than 60 First
Nation communities have declared their opposition to the project, calling it a violation of their
rights and the integrity of their traditional territories.
Pure
greenwash? Only time will tell. And HSBC's dealings (or not) with Enbridge and
TransCanada will be early indicators. Meantime, at the very least, the new HSBC
policy is a welcome sign that banks are beginning to recognize that tar sands
is a risky business.
For
those keeping score, international banks that have developed sector-specific
policies that cover tar sands are (in chronological order):

 Dexia -November, '08
 Rabobank
-April, '10
 RBC -December, '10
 HSBC -January '11

United States ",The Pandora's Box of Mekong Dams,,,Xayaburi dam ,energy plants - dams,Laos,"
When
 Zeus warned Pandora never to open the box given to her, the temptation 
proved too strong and Pandora forever unleashed into the world misery, 
suffering and sorrow. Today, much like this mythical Greek tragedy, the 
decision-makers of the Mekong sub-region face a similar temptation in 
the form of a cascade of hydropower dams proposed for the Mekong River's
 mainstream.
As one of the first of the Mekong mainstream dams that could be unleashed from Pandora's Box, the decision on whether or not to proceed with the Xayaburi Dam in Northern Laos is one of the most pressing challenges facing the 
Governments of Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.  This dam, along 
with warnings of future environmental catastrophe in the form of a Strategic Environment Assessment (SEA) report, will be two of the agenda items discussed at this week's 
Mekong River Commission's 17th Council meeting being held in Ho Chi Minh
 City, Vietnam.   As protocol under the 1995 Mekong Agreement requires 
the four member countries to notify, consult, and then make a joint 
decision on any mainstream development project, the governance body of 
the MRC, the Council, will also take note of the current consultation 
process underway in three of the four countries.
With
 little expressed commitment to consultation and transparency and a 
regional decision expected to be made as early as April 2011, the Save the Mekong coalition has released a new statement on January 25th, urging Council members 
to halt the Xayaburi Dam and commit to protecting the Mekong River 
before its too late.   The letter highlights concerns within the Mekong 
Region that an informed decision can not be made under present 
circumstances given the failure of the MRC to ensure adequate 
consideration of the SEA report's recommendation that decisions 
regarding mainstream dams, including the Xayaburi Dam, be deferred for a
 period of ten years due to the dams' massive risks and the significant 
scientific uncertainties that exist.  The research undertaken to date, 
including the SEA report, warrants concern given the grave economic, 
social and ecological threats, both domestic and transboundary, that the
 Mekong dams are expected to cause on the river's rich ecosystem.   
These impacts in turn would have enormous risks and costs to the 
livelihoods and food security of millions of riverside people in the 
region.Given these concerns within the region, along with the 
fact that the MRC has failed to uphold international standards of public
 accountability and transparency, and ensure that the opinions of Mekong
 riparian communities are central to any decision taken, the Save the 
Mekong coalition has urged the Council to:

Halt the current 
PNPCA decision-making process on the Xayaburi Dam, as recommended by the
 SEA report to defer decision-making for 10 years, and commit to 
evaluating all options for meeting the Mekong Region's water and energy 
needs through a credible and objective public process. Urgent further 
research on the opportunities for investment in sustainable alternative 
energy technologies and improved energy efficiency measures should feed 
into this process.
Endorse the SEA report's findings and commit 
the MRC and respective governments to fully disclose existing 
information concerning each mainstream dam project.
Commit to 
ensure that any future public hearings, including on the Xayaburi Dam, 
be designed and directed from the outset in a participatory manner thus 
ensuring that the opinion of the people who would be affected by any 
proposed infrastructure project be heard and accounted for.
Affirm
 a commitment towards protecting the Mekong River's rich environmental 
and economic productivity, and ensuring that the Mekong River remains 
healthy and free-flowing for the livelihoods of present and future 
generations.

In a world facing a growing food and water 
crisis, working together to protect and share the Mekong River's rich 
natural resources, rather than undermining them, should be a high 
priority for the region's decision-makers. If, like Pandora, 
decision-makers choose not to heed the advice of the SEA report and 
instead open the dam-building box, grave misfortune is certain to 
follow. It is yet not too late to prevent the tragedy of these dams from
 being unleashed. Some boxes are meant to remain unopened.

San Fransisco ",New report finds bank Carbon Principles did not curb financing of coal,Bank of America ,United States,,,,"
Today Rainforest Action Network (RAN) released, 'The
Principle Matter; Banks, Climate and The Carbon Principles', a new report
assessing the impact of the much-lauded 2008 Carbon Principles signed by six of the
country's leading banks. In reviewing bank investment from January 2008 to June
of 2010, the report found that there is no evidence that the Carbon Principles
stopped or slowed financing to carbon-intensive projects. In addition, the
report found that there is no evidence that the Carbon Principles spurred
investment in clean energy in greater levels.
Three leading banks, Citi, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan
Stanley announced the Carbon Principles in February 2008. The Carbon
Principles were the outcome of a nine-month bank led process to evaluate and
address carbon risks in the financing of electric power projects in the United States.
The Carbon Principles represent the first time that financial institutions
jointly committed to advance a consistent approach to the issue of climate
change in the U.S.
electric power industry. Since the Principles were released, Wells Fargo, Bank of
America and Credit Suisse have subsequently become signatories.
The Carbon Principles were a significant step in
establishing carbon risk as important for banks to consider. Based on the
serious threat posed by global climate change, however, it is time leading
financial institutions develop a more robust framework of policies and
practices that concretely reduce emissions from electric power,"" said
Amanda Starbuck of Rainforest Action Network. When the Carbon Principles were
created, they were one of the first industry-wide statements from the banking
sector specifically addressing climate change and carbon-intensive investments.
The Principles were designed to address the risks associated with regulatory
uncertainty of carbon emissions, and were also a direct response to growing
public concern over plans for more than one hundred new coal-fired power
plants.
RAN's report compared the financing of major utilities
building new coal fired power plants over a two year period and found that
there was no discernable difference in financing patterns between banks that
signed on to the Carbon Principles and those that did not. The report did find
that the Carbon Principles placed stricter due diligence conditions on banks
for financing the construction of new coal fired power plants in the United States.
""In short, have the Carbon Principles restricted financing to coal-fired power
plants or encouraged greater levels of clean energy investments? Sadly, the
answer is no,"" continued Starbuck. ""Our research reveals that, while
the broader economy has been shifting away from coal for myriad reasons, if the
Carbon Principle banks want to take leadership in addressing coal and climate
change in the financial sector they must do more.""
As a case study, RAN's report reviewed the financing of
two American Municipal Power (formerly AMP-Ohio) coal-fired power plants, which
were both funded by banks that signed on to the Carbon Principles. Needing to
secure nearly $4 billion from a bond placement for one of the plants, AMP
contacted JPMorgan in early 2008 with concerns regarding how the Carbon
Principles might affect the company's ability to raise capital. On February 7,
2008, a response from JPMorgan, which was leaked to the press, assured AMP that
""othing in the Principles prevents us from underwriting debt or
providing financing for AMP- Ohio's projects or is intended to do so.""
The RAN report recommends that leading financial
institutions develop a more robust framework of policies and practices to
address climate risk, which would include:

Performance, not just procedural, standards for
financial transactions and client engagement
 Phase out support for new and existing
coal-fired power plants
 Phase out support for new and existing coal
extraction and delivery projects
 A commitment to dramatically increase support
for financing emissions reduction technology, renewable energy production and
energy efficiency in all business lines

In compiling this review, RAN compared Carbon Principles
with non-Carbon Principles bank underwriting in the U.S. electricity sector; reviewed
signatory bank reporting of Carbon Principles implementation; interviewed bank
and civil society participants in the Carbon Principles process; and examined
alternative policy frameworks.  "

Brussels/Abuja ",New report: biofuel 'wonder-crop' Jatropha fails to deliver,,,,,,"
The much-touted biofuel crop
jatropha is neither a profitable nor a sustainable investment, according to a
new report released by Friends of the Earth Europe today.  'Jatropha: money doesn't grow on trees' warns investors away from jatropha - a
shrub being increasingly planted for its oil-producing fruits and ability to
survive in arid conditions - stating growing evidence that the crop is failing
to deliver on its promises while simultaneously failing to prevent climate
change or contribute to pro-poor development.   Paul de Clerck, Economic Justice programme coordinator for Friends of the Earth
Europe said:""European investment companies advertise that jatropha guarantees
high returns on marginal soils - but their promises are far from realistic. Many
projects have already been abandoned because yields have stayed below
expectations, even on good soils. Large-scale jatropha plantations are neither
a profitable nor sustainable investment; companies should stop land-grabbing
for jatropha.""  Jatropha is being promoted by investment companies as a profit-making panacea,
providing a source of biofuel that can be grown on marginal land across Africa,
Asia and Latin America. But research from Friends of the Earth Europe reveals
that investments in large-scale jatropha plantations are failing due to the
crop's poor performance, with increasing evidence of low yields on poor quality
soils, and even good soil. The report highlights jatropha companies such as D1
Oils and Flora EcoPower who have been unsuccessful, illustrating that the
plant's economic viability is highly doubtful .  The investments are controversially fuelling land-grabs in Africa,
displacing farmers and communities whilst competing with food production and
water supplies.  Mariann Bassey, food and agriculture coordinator for Environmental Rights
Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria said: ""In Africa, farmland is taken away
from communities and people's livelihoods are destroyed for yet another false
solution to climate change. Food prices are rising again, yet land is being
snatched away to grow fuel for cars. We want agriculture that allows us to grow
food for people.""  The full report can be downloaded here

of their joint venture with D1 Oils because of disappointing results. Other
examples are the Swedish private company BioMassive, which leased land in
Tanzania for jatropha plantations, but reported losses until 2009 and have not

Brasília and São Paulo, Brazil ",Risky Business in the Amazon,,,Belo Monte dam ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"
The Belo
Monte Dam Complex, slated to begin construction in April along the Xingu
River in heart of the Brazilian Amazon, not only threatens ecological integrity
and the livelihoods of indigenous peoples and other local communities but also
presents tremendous risks for financiers, investors and the country's
taxpayers, according to a new report issued by International Rivers and Friends of the Earth - Brazilian Amazonia. 
The report ""Mega-Project,
Mega Risks: Analysis of Risks for Investors in the Belo Monte Hydroelectric Complex"" was delivered today to over 20 institutions currently or potentially involved
in the project, including the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES), pension funds
and private banks, among others.
One of the main findings of the report concerns
uncertainties over mitigation and compensation costs of the project, including
potentially disastrous social and environmental consequences.  According
to Federal Public Prosecutor Felício Pontes, ""the forced resettlement of
indigenous communities living along the Volta Grande (Big Bend) of the Xingu - a 100 km stretch where the river would be
diverted to artificial canals to generate electricity - could result in
lawsuits against investors of up to a billion dollars"".
According to Pontes, such problems reflect an
environmental licensing process marred by political intervention during the
administrations of ex-president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and incoming
President Dilma Rousseff.  Last week's resignation of Abelardo Bayma
Azevedo, the President of Brazil's environmental agency IBAMA, amidst intense
political pressures to grant an installation license for Belo Monte, is the
latest in a series of controversies that have overshadowed the project.  Nine
civil action lawsuits are pending in Brazilian courts, while similar complaints
on violations of international agreements on human rights and environmental
protection have been filed with the United Nations and the Interamerican
Commission on Human Rights.
The role of the Brazilian National Development Bank
(BNDES) in Belo Monte has also come under increasing scrutiny.  Last
month, the Federal Public Prosecutor's office delivered an official letter to
Bank president Luciano Coutinho, demanding clarifications on criteria and
procedures used for analyzing social, environmental and financial costs and
risks of Belo Monte, both in relation to a recently-approved start-up loan of
US$ 640 million loan to the dam-building consortium Norte Energia, and BNDES's
publicly-announced decision to finance up to 80% of total project costs.  Coutinho
has yet to answer the letter.
Other key risks identified in the new report concern
uncertainties over the construction costs and generating capacity of the Belo
Monte Dam Complex.  Estimates of total costs of the mega-project have
varied between US$ 12 and 20 billion.  The construction of Belo Monte, as
the world's third largest dam, would require more land excavation than the Panama Canal in an area with scarce knowledge of soil and
rock characteristics - a key variable for calculating construction costs. 
While the project would have a generating capacity of 11,200 MW, only some 40%
of that capacity would be effectively used, due to high seasonality of the Xingu River
that is expected to intensify with global climate change.  The dam would
produce almost no energy for several months during the height of the dry
season.  This dilemma is expected to lead to political pressures to build
additional dams upstream on the Xingu
 River to store water for
Belo Monte, resulting in even more disastrous social and environmental impacts,
especially for indigenous peoples and greenhouse gas emissions.
According to Roland Widmer, coordinator of the
Eco-Finances program at Friends of the Earth - Brazilian Amazonia and a
co-author of the study, ""in addition to the financial and legal risks of
involvement in Belo Monte, banks and other financiers face huge reputational
risks, given the tremendous potential for environmental and social
damage.  Publicly-adhered to social and environmental safeguards would be
violated"".

Bruissels Belgium ",Stop Tar Sands trade talks,,,Canadian tar sands ,oil and gas,Canada,"
 
European and Canadian civil society groups joined together today outside Canada-EU free trade talks to give a clear warning to the public and negotiators that increasing Europe's involvement in the Canadian tar sands is unacceptable.
The diverse groups held a ""Stop Tar Sands Trade Talks"" banner, and placards with an oily Canadian flag dripping onto an EU flag, while also distributing information outside European Commission headquarters to draw attention to the sixth round of Canada-EU Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) negotiations, happening January 17 to 21 in Brussels.
""We are concerned that the CETA negotiations will give dramatic new powers to European oil companies like Shell, BP and Total, allowing them to legally challenge any attempts to regulate their activities in the tar sands for social or environmental reasons. In order to prevent dangerous climate change we need to be shutting the tar sands down, not
helping our companies invest in them,"" said Suzanne Dhaliwal, from UK Tar Sands Network, who held a protest about the trade talks last Friday at the office of Britain's controversial new unelected Trade Minister Stephen Green, who is the former Chair of HSBC - the world's 13th largest investor in the tar sands.
""Tar sands are the most climate hostile energy source in commercial production today,"" said Darek Urbaniak, Extractive Industries Campaigner, Friends of the Earth Europe. ""While Europe is working to reduce fossil fuels emissions Canada is using these trade negotiations to undermine this process. It has already been lobbying to water down
the EU's Fuel Quality Directive to treat oil produced from tar sands like conventional sources. EU decision makers should ensure that CETA enhances European climate policy and not the development of Canadian tar sands.""
Canada's tar sands are the second largest petroleum reserve in the world, and their production is having serious social and environmental consequences. Producing oil from tar sands emits on average 3 to 5 times more greenhouse gases (GHGs) than conventional oil production. It requires and contaminates massive amounts of water and is having direct impacts on the health and way of life of First Nations communities living downstream from operations.
 ""The economic benefits of CETA have been oversold and the environmental costs ignored by the Canadian and European governments. The trade deal on the table leaves little room for badly needed climate change policies. In fact it will undoubtedly increase greenhouse gas emissions from mining, energy and transportation. Without a major re-write, Europeans and Canadians must reject CETA,"" says Stuart Trew, Trade Campaigner with the Council of Canadians.
 ""The debate over the tar sands extraction needs to come down to the fundamental human rights of First Nations to exist and have a future with a safe, clean and healthy environment,"" says Clayton Thomas-Muller , Tar Sands Campaigner with the Indigenous Environmental Network. ""First Nations' access to basic human necessities is supposedly protected by domestic and international law but CETA, by encouraging more extraction projects and giving that kind of investment strong new protections, threatens First Nations' access to clean drinking water, land and sustenance.""
The CETA negotiations are currently in full swing, and due to be completed towards the end of 2011. Yet most European citizens have no idea the talks are taking place. A legal analysis  on the potential impact of CETA negotiations reveals that it could undermine climate policy in Europe and give dramatic new powers to Europe's multinational oil companies. For example, the European Commission has asked Parliament for permission to negotiate an investor-to-state dispute process that would allow EU companies to sue the Canadian government in the eventfuture regulations, water use limits or other environmental protections interfere with their profits. Likewise, Canadian companies will be able to take otherwise legitimate and legal EU decisions before non-transparent arbitration panels with the power to hand out fines. The Canadian government has said negotiating an investor-to-state dispute process is one of its most important objectives in CETA. The chill effect from this process is enough to discourage governments from pursuing effective climate and environmental policy. The civil society groups are therefore calling for the talks to be put on hold until they can be subjected to full public scrutiny and the many social and environmental concerns adequately addressed.

Canada ",RBC takes step away from tar sands,Royal Bank of  (RBC) ,Canada,Canadian tar sands ,oil and gas,Canada,"
The
Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) today made public its new environmental and
social standards, which will govern financing of clients in high-impact
sectors including Canada's tar sands. The announcement marks a
significant about face on tar sands by one of the sectors biggest
financiers. The policy is the first by a major international bank to
document whether bank clients have received consent from Indigenous
communities. This follows nearly two years of campaigning by Rainforest
Action Network (RAN) alongside First Nations concerned about the
negative impacts of tar sands development.
Just week's after Canada signed on to the United Nations Declaration
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), RBC's policy breaks
significant new ground among international banks with its handling of
Indigenous rights. For bank clients in high-impact sectors, including
the tar sands, the policy guides bankers to document where client
activities impact Indigenous communities and the status of consultation
with those communities. Bankers will have to examine whether clients
have ""policies and processes consistent with the standard of Free,
Prior and Informed Consent.""
""With RBC's new policy, the banking giant has made a promise to take
responsibility for its financing in the tar sands and to uphold the
rights of First Nations. We commend the bank for its new commitment,
and look forward to seeing policy put into practice,"" said Brant Olson,
campaign director for the Rainforest Action Network. ""RBC is raising
the bar for the financial sector and signaling to oil and gas
corporations that it is time to take environmental and human rights
seriously."" "

Germany ",urgewald publishes new consumer brochure on nuclear banks,Commerzbank ,Germany,,,,"
On December 21,
the German Banktrack member urgewald launched its new consumer brochure ""How radioactive is my bank?"". The
brochure identifies which German banks are most heavily involved with the
nuclear industry and gives detailed descriptions of the individual deals per
bank. With 7.8 billion Euro in nuclear deals, Deutsche Bank is  Germany's most radioactive bank. It
is followed by Commerzbank with 3,9 bio. Euro and HVB/Unicredit with 2,3 bio Euro.
""I'm not
surprised that we are being swamped with orders for the brochure,"" says
urgewald's director, Heffa Schücking. ""More and more people want to find
out what exactly their own banks are up to and a large majority of the German population
views nuclear power as a dangerous and dirty industry.""As consumers want
to know what their options are, the brochure also presents alternatives and names
four German banks, which firmly exclude the nuclear industry and uranium mining
from their portfolio.
According to
Schücking: ""Financing an industry that expects the next 10,000 generations
to deal with its waste is in stark contradiction to bank's sustainability
rhetoric. It's time that conventional banks realize that nuclear business is a
high risk to their own reputation.""

Phulbari, Bangladesh ",WikiLeaks cables confirm concerns of IAP and partners in Bangladesh mine case,Credit Suisse ,Switzerland,Phulbari coal mine ,mining - coal ,Bangladesh,"
When the news broke
yesterday that a WikiLeaks cable revealed US diplomats secretly pushed the
Bangladeshi government to re-open plans for a massive coal mine, the cable
provided evidence that confirmed concerns raised since 2008 by a national
organization in Bangladesh and international human rights groups, including San
Francisco-based International Accountability Project
(http://AccountabilityProject.org):  ""WikiLeaks cables prove that US officials chose to ignore the tens of thousands
of Bangladeshi people marching in the streets to oppose this mine.   Behind
closed doors, they aggressively pushed for a reckless coal project that would
evict and impoverish thousands in Bangladesh-and
line the pockets of a few hedge fund managers in the U.S.,"" commented Joanna Levitt,
Executive Director of International Accountability Project.  The WikiLeaks cable refers to the proposed Phulbari Coal Project-a vast coal
extraction scheme that would create one of the biggest open-pit coal mines in
the world.   The mine would destroy over 6,000 hectares of productive
farmland in an area that currently serves as an agricultural breadbasket for Bangladesh. 
In addition, a 2008 Expert Committee Report commissioned by the Bangladeshi
government found that nearly 130,000 (129,417) people would be forcibly evicted
from their homes and lands, most of whom are indigenous and farming families
with multi-generational ties to the land.    Efforts to push this project forward have already resulted in
bloodshed.  In August of 2006, paramilitary forces opened fire on
thousands of peaceful demonstrators opposing the mine, killing three people,
including a 14-year-old boy, and injuring more then 200.     The WikiLeaks cable includes comments by US Ambassador to Bangladesh, James Moriarty, that, ""Asia Energy,
the company behind the Phulbari project, has sixty percent US
investment.""  In the cable, sent in July of 2009, Moriarty also states
that he urged the prime minister's energy advisor to authorize coal mining,
saying the ""open-pit mining seemed the best way forward.""  ""We have seen for decades that the US Embassy works as lobby staff for
corporations-and not for the people,"" commented Professor Anu Mohammad of Jahangirnagar University and Secretary of a
nation-wide people's organization, the National Committee for the Protection of
Oil, Gas & Minerals (http://www.protectresourcesbd.org).    International Accountability Project (IAP) has been following the case since
2008, partnering with Professor Mohammad and others in Bangladesh to
conduct field research on the scale of forced eviction and displacement that
the mine would cause, and to pressure investors to withdraw their support for
the project-including the Asian Development Bank and Barclays.     ""While US media attention on
WikiLeaks has focused on the possible threats to security,"" Levitt added, ""we
cannot let it go unnoticed that these cables also reveal hugely problematic
entanglements between US
governance abroad and US corporate interests at home.""  IAP Senior Research Fellow Kate Hoshour commented, ""Let's not forget the global
warming impact.   The Phulbari project would dramatically expand
coal-based energy production, the worst offender in terms of greenhouse gas
emissions and dirty energy.   And it's being proposed for a country
that is among the most vulnerable in the world to the impacts of climate
change.""   ""If a mine like Phulbari goes ahead,"" said Professor Mohammad from his home in
Phulbari, ""it is not just our local people here who lose when our homes and
lands are destroyed.   All people lose, US people too, because
environment is a global issue-and the environmental impacts here would be
huge.""  Global Coal Management Resources plc (GCM), a UK-based company, and their
wholly owned subsidiary Asia Energy Corporation (Bangladesh) Pty Limited, control
the Phulbari Coal Project, their sole asset.   Nearly 40% of all GCM
shares are owned by the four companies that make up the Luxor Capital Group,
all of which are owned by Christian Leone, a US citizen who also operates a
New-York-based hedge fund in his own name     "

San Fransisco ",Swiss bankers clean up their act,UBS ,Switzerland,,,,"

UBS, one of the
world's biggest banks, has been accused of dirty business for years. The Swiss
bank helped the Marcos and Mobutu clans stash away their ill-gotten wealth, and
allegedly funneled more than $1 billion into Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme. It was
a key financier of South Africa's apartheid regime, and funds destructive coal
mines around the world.
A leaked document
shows that the bank is now making an effort to clean up its act. ""We will
strengthen the image of UBS as a company that has integrity and a sense of
responsibility if we behave beyond reproach in our daily interactions with all
interest groups"", the internal document says. Yet it does not advise you
on how best to avoid tainted assets. The manual will tell you what you may expect
from your UBS banker in terms of proper
attire and hygiene. Here are some examples from the bank's new dress code:

Your banker's shirt sleeves will extend 1.5-2.5
centimeters beyond his jacket. Her skirt will end at the middle of her knees,
or up to 5 centimeter below.
 His socks will be black, and will not show his legs no
matter how he sits. His tie will get at least one day of rest after each call
of duty.
 Your banker may wear sunglasses outdoors, but not on
top of his head. A wrist watch will give him an air of reliability and
punctuality.
 The wallet will not bulge the pockets of your banker's
pants. (He does not receive his bonus in cash!)
 Your banker will avoid meals with onions and garlic,
and his finger nails will not extend more than 1.5 millimeters.
 His underwear, in case you wondered, will be
""exclusively made of high-quality
fabric, can be washed easily, but will remain in good shape after being washed
several times"".

The 44-page dress
code is mandatory for UBS staff with client contact; compliance will be
enforced by the bank's management. Lest we Swiss come across as rigid, bankers
may take off their jackets in hot weather if their supervisor agrees. And, the
manual offers, ""whether you shave wet or dry is up to you."" Sounds
better than casual Friday!
The dress code's
insistence on proper underwear is not something to snicker at. I have friends
at Swiss banks who take their high net worth clients to the sauna and try on
dresses for their girl friends. The new manual shows that UBS will go an extra
mile for integrity and responsibility.
While certainly
elaborate, the bankers' cleanliness guide contains a few gaps. How do responsible
bankers avoid the stench of corruption and environmental destruction? The Berne
Declaration, a Swiss advocacy group, has documented strong UBS involvement in
destructive goldmines around the world. Rainforest Action Network and the
Sierra Club tell us that the bank is the biggest non-US financier of mountain-top
removal.
And the
anti-corruption watchdog Global Witness recently reported that UBS, together
with four British banks, ""helped to fuel corruption and entrench poverty
in Nigeria by taking money from corrupt governors"" between 1999 and 2005.
May we hope that the bank's sense of hygiene and integrity will soon bring us
stronger guidelines on protecting the environment and human rights?

London, UK ",Sudanese president may have $9 billion with Lloyds bank,Lloyds Banking Group ,United Kingdom,,,,"
UK Taxpayer-funded
Lloyds bank may have ""stashed"" $9 billion for President Omar
al-Bashir of Sudan, according to Wikileaks cables published in the Guardian today. Lloyds must now
confirm if this is true or not and if it is then the bank must publicly explain
what due diligence checks it has done to ensure that these funds are not the
proceeds of corruption, said Global Witness.
Leaked US embassy
cables state that the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court
(ICC), Luis Moreno-Ocampo, told US officials that he believed that Bashir had a
""stash of money"" in ""illegal accounts"" worth $9 billion. The prosecutor, who
has indicted Bashir for war crimes, reported that ""Lloyd's Bank in London might
be holding or knowledgeable of the whereabouts of his money"".
""If this
allegation by the ICC prosecutor is accurate, it appears that a UK high street
bank bailed out by the government is holding billions controlled by an indicted
war criminal, or at the very least would be able to help trace any funds"" said
Robert Palmer, a campaigner with Global Witness.
Under the UK's
anti-money laundering laws banks are required to check their customers'
identity and their source of funds to ensure that the money they handle is
clean, and the Financial Services Authority is meant to ensure that banks are
doing this. Global Witness has repeatedly called for banks to do more to turn
down suspect funds.
""Maybe Lloyds
knows something about Bashir's and Sudan's finances that we don't, but $9
billion is an extraordinary amount of money for a head of state to control. If
this story is true, I'd like to know what controls Lloyds put in place to
ensure that the funds were legitimate - and I'm sure the Sudanese people would
as well"" added Palmer. It is not clear from the cable whether the supposed
accounts are in the name of Bashir personally, a Sudanese state account over
which he has control, or a third party.  
The unequal
distribution of wealth was one of the primary drivers of the 22-year civil war
between north and south Sudan in which 1.5 million people died. The
Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed in 2005 splits oil revenues between the
two sides, though southerners have persistently accused Bashir's government in
the north of cheating them out of a significant portion of the money they are
owed. By coincidence, $9 billion is just short of the amount transferred from
north to south in oil revenues since 2005.
A referendum on
potential independence for the south will be held in January and is a source of
immense tension between north and south.  Both sides have massed armies
along their border in readiness for renewed conflict.  
""If the cable is
true, more than just doing business with an indicted war criminal, Lloyd's
could be in some sense contributing to instability and mistrust in Sudan at the
most fragile moment in its history,"" warned Palmer.
In January 2009
Lloyds was fined $350 million by the American authorities for disguising the
origins of wire transfers from Sudan as well as Iran and Libya in order to
avoid US sanctions against those countries.
 
Notes to editors:
1. Global Witness'
September 2009 report, Fuelling Mistrust, raised
significant concerns about the lack of transparency in the oil sharing
agreement between north and south. In October 2010 Global Witness' report International Thief
Thiefrevealed how a number of British banks, including Barclays, Natwest, RBS
and HSBC had accepted millions of pounds from corrupt Nigerian politicians.
2. Lloyds issued
the following statement to the Guardian: ""We have absolutely no evidence
to suggest there is any connection between Lloyds Banking Group and Mr Bashir.
The group's policy is to abide by the legal and regulatory obligations in all
jurisdictions in which we operate.""

Netherlands ",Dutch unknowingly invest in extremely polluting oil production,,,Canadian tar sands ,oil and gas,Canada,"
Dutch citizens invested 1.6
billion euro's in extremely polluting oil production from tar sands via their
pension funds. This was revealed last Monday in a report published by Friends
of the Earth Netherlands. By investing in the tar sands, Dutch pension funds
finance the emission of extra greenhouse gases and the destruction of Canadian
primal forests. Unwittingly many Dutch invest in this unsustainable way of
producing oil.
Tar sands
Tar sands are areas where heavy
oil is mixed with sand and water. This type of oil is far more difficult to
extract than conventional oil, so production costs more energy and therefore
more CO2 emissions. The production of gasoline from tar sand costs three times
as much CO2 then normal oil production. Enormous areas are strip mined to
access the tar sand or are criss-crossed with pipelines that destroy the primal
forests. Oil production from tar sands produces enormous quantities of oily sludge
residue. This sludge is stored in enormous lakes.
Pension fund investments
The research report, written by
consultancy Profundo, also concludes that investments in tar sands are at this
moment only 0.2 percent of the total investment portfolio of Dutch pension
funds. It is therefore not a big deal for the funds to stop this type of
investments.
Stop investing in extreme pollution
Previous research by Friends of
the Earth Europe showed that oil multinationals such as Shell, plan to increase
the percentage of tar sands and other types of heavy or difficult oil
production. Friends of the Earth therefore emphasizes that now is the moment to
act. It is still possible to change course. ""We call on pension funds and oil
companies to stop investing in
this type of extreme pollution and to put our money in sustainable energy."",
said Geert Ritsema, spokesperson for Friends of the Earth Netherlands. "

Switserland ",Schweizer Banken auf dem Holzweg,UBS ,Switzerland,,,,"
Papier- und Palmölproduzenten verzeichnen in Indonesien seit einigen
Jahren ein unglaubliches Wachstum - auf Kosten der Umwelt. Möglich wird
die rapide Expansion der Plantagenflächen in Regenwald- und
Torfmoorgebiete unter anderem durch ausländische Finanzinstitute. Zu
den Geldgebern der notorischen Urwaldvernichter gehört auch die
Schweizer Grossbank UBS. Diese profitiert von Geschäftsverbindungen mit
der Sinar Mas Gruppe, welcher die Holding-Gesellschaft Golden Agri
Ressources (GAR) im Palmölbereich sowie der Papier- und
Zellstoffbereich Asia Pulp and Paper (APP) angehören.
Wie Wunden
klaffen riesige Monokulturen - Palm- und Akazienplantagen - in den
immergrünen Wäldern der indonesischen Inselgruppe. 74 Millionen Hektare
Regenwald hat das Land in den letzten 50 Jahren geschlagen. Das
entspricht fast 40 Prozent der Landesfläche. Und trotzdem werden jedes
Jahr weitere 2 Prozent des kostbaren Waldes vernichtet. Bei der
Abholzung und Brandrodung der Wälder und Torfböden entladen sich
jährlich 1.8 Milliarden Tonnen Co2 in die Atmosphäre - 4 % der weltweiten CO2 Emissionen.
Der unersättlichen Papier- und Palmölhunger unserer Industrienationen fordert nicht nur die Vernichtung eines wertvollen CO2-Speichers,
sondern auch die unwiderrufliche Zerstörung letzter Lebensräume
zahlreicher bedrohter Tier- und Pflanzenarten wie Sumatra-Tiger,
Borneo-Nashorn und Orang-Utan. Allein der Bestand der Menschenaffen ist
in den letzten 100 Jahren um 91 Prozent zurückgegangen. Die Chancen auf
eine Erholung der Populationen stehen sehr schlecht. Zudem wird den
indigenen Völkern der Region ihre Existenzgrundlage entzogen, und es
kommt immer wieder zu Landesrechtskonflikten mit Plantagenbesitzern.
Schweizer Finanzierungshilfen
Sinar Mas, einer der Hauptverursacher dieses ökologischen Dramas,
ist ein Geschäftspartner der Schweizer Grossbank UBS. Asia Pulp and
Paper (APP), der Zellstoff- und Papierbereich von Sinar Mas, ist der
viertgrösste Papierproduzent weltweit. Unter seinem Dach sind die
größten Zellstoff- und Papierfirmen Asiens zusammengefasst. 5,07
Millionen Tonnen Papier und Verpackung produziert die APP pro Jahr im
asiatischen Raum;  2,3 Millionen Tonnen allein in Indonesien.
Greenpeace verlieh dem Konzern im Dezember dieses Jahres den Anti-Preis
«International Golden Chainsaw Award» .
Als die APP in den 80er Jahren zu expandieren begann, standen
ausländischen Geldgeber Schlange, um sich in Form von Krediten oder
Anteilen ein Stück vom Kuchen zu sichern. Dass der bis 1998 amtierende
indonesische Diktator Suharto dem Sektor riesige Waldgebiete zur
Abholzung und Umwandlung in Plantagen überlassen hatte, machte das
Geschäft nur umso lukrativer. Auflagen für eine Renaturierung gab es
keine - dafür aber Holz zum Nulltarif.
Das Ganze entpuppte sich dennoch als ein Eigentor für die Financiers
und APP, denn die Vernichtung wertvoller Wäldern zahlt sich
wirtschaftlich nicht aus. Letztendlich steigen die Produktionskosten,
etwa wenn das Holz aus immer weiter entfernten Landesteilen
herangeschafft werden muss. Trotzdem verschleuderte die APP das Papier
zu Spottpreisen auf dem Weltmarkt und steuerte so 2001 auf einen
Bankrott zu. Aus dem indonesischen Wirtschaftswunderkind war ein
Urwaldvernichter mit einem Schuldenberg von rund 13,4 Milliarden Dollar
geworden. Das höchst verschuldete Unternehmen Asiens, dank der vielen
ausländischen Kredite. Zu dieser Zeit, übernahm die damalige Credit
Suisse First Boston in der Folge das Beratungsmandat für die
Refinanzierung des überschuldeten Konzerns.
Unbequeme Greenpeace-Reporte
Obwohl offensichtlich ist, dass der wirtschaftliche und ökologische
Unsinn des Geschäftsmodells der APP langfristig nur scheitern kann,
fliessen die Kredite auch heute noch. Weder der immense Schuldenberg,
noch die skrupellose Abholzung der Wälder scheint die Finanzinstitute
abzuschrecken. Damit nicht genug: Aktuell versucht die APP auch in
Europa und der Schweiz Fuss zu fassen. Das könnte ihr mithilfe der
Schweizer Banken sogar gelingen.
So ist einer ihrer Gläubiger die Schweizer UBS. Sie ist nicht nur
Kreditgeber, sondern auch als «Bookrunner» für einen geplanten
Börsengang der APP-China Tochter «Golden Paper», tätig. Auch im
Palmölbereich von Sinar Mas hat die UBS die Finger im Spiel. Indonesien
grösste Palmölproduzentin Golden Agri Ressources (GAR) ist die
Holding-Gesellschaft aller Palmölfirmen von Sinar Mas. Die GAR ist
börsenkotiert und hat 51 Prozent ihres gesamten Aktienkapitals frei
gegeben. Hier zählt die UBS zu den hundert grössten Aktionären. Im Juli
2009 beschloss die GAR ihr Börsenkapital auf rund 215 Millionen Dollar
zu erhöhen. Einer der so genannten «Joint Bookrunners» war die UBS -
mit 71,7 Millionen Dollar Kapital.
Seitdem Greenpeace mit Reports wie «Burning up Borneo», «Illegal Forest Clearance and RSPO Greenwash» , «How Sinar Mas is expanding its empires of destruction» oder  «How Sinar Mas is pulping the planet»
Ausmass und Folgen der Regenwaldvernichtung veröffentlicht,  steigt der
Druck auf Sinar Mas. Grosskonzerne wie Unilever, Nestlé oder Burger
King haben sich inzwischen von der Gruppe distanziert.
Fadenscheinige «Nachhaltigkeit»
«BankTrack» ist
eine Koalition von Nichtregierungsorganisationen, welche es sich zur
Aufgabe gemacht hat, weltweit Finanzinstitute unter die Lupe zu nehmen. Im April 2010 veröffentlichte
sie eine Zusammenstellung aus der hervorgeht, dass UBS und Credit
Suisse in Sachen Richtlinien im Forstsektor mehr als schlecht
abschneiden.
Liest man die Verantwortlichkeits- und Nachhaltigkeitsrichtlinien
der Banken, würde man sich gerne vom Gegenteil überzeugen lassen. Bei
genauerem Hinsehen muss man aber feststellen, dass es meist nichts
anderes ist als ein grobmaschiges Netz mit vielen Schlupflöchern. So
lässt die UBS unter «Nachhaltig bei UBS» verlauten:
«Einige Kunden von UBS sind in Sektoren tätig, die im Hinblick
auf Umwelt- und Sozialrisiken als besonders sensitiv gelten. Diese
Richtlinien decken derzeit folgende Sektoren ab: Chemie, Erdöl und Gas,
Versorgung, Infrastruktur, Forstwirtschaft, Biotreibstoffe sowie
Bergbau und Gewinnung von Metallen. Wir sind der Ansicht, dass
unsere Verpflichtung gegenüber unseren Kunden und der Gesellschaft von
uns verlangt, wenn immer möglich nach Lösungen zu suchen. Wir
versuchen, mit unseren Kunden Verfahren zu erarbeiten, die umwelt- und
sozialverträglicher sind. Davon kann der Kunde profitieren, da
möglicherweise das Reputations- und das finanzielle Risiko seines
Geschäfts sinkt. Ist eine solche Zusammenarbeit nicht möglich oder
scheitern diese Versuche, kann UBS die Transaktion ablehnen.»
Geköpfte Berge
Transaktionen, welche die UBS abbrechen müsste, gibt es genug: Die
Liste der von der UBS finanzierten ökologischen Katastrophen geht weit
über die Vernichtung des indonesischen Regenwaldes hinaus. Zum Beispiel
das in den USA durch die Firma  Massey Energy praktizierte  «Mountain Top Removal». BeimMTR werden
ganze Bergkappen abgesprengt um die drunter liegende Kohle zu
erreichen. Entstehender Abraum wird in die Täler gekippt, ganze Flüsse
zugedeckt und vergiftet. Zurück bleibt eine giftige Anreicherung von
Schlamm, Kohlestaub, Arsen und Quecksilber. Die UBS finanzierte «Massey
Energy» seit 2008 mit insgesamt 900 Millionen Dollar. Aussteigen will
die Bank bislang nicht, sie könne sich aber vorstellen, nur noch Kunden
zu unterstützen, welche bereit sind, MTR «graduell zu reduzieren», wie
sie in einer Erklärung verlauten liess. Was eine graduelle Reduzierung
aber genau heissen soll, bleibt unklar.
Die Forderungen von Greenpeace
Ein weiteres Projekt mit verheerenden ökologischen Folgen, an dem
beide Schweizer Grossbanken, UBS und Credit Suisse mitverdienen, ist der Ölsandabbau in Kanada.
Kritiken dazu wiesen beide Unternehmen als unberechtigt zurück: Die UBS
schiebt die Verantwortung auf den Kunden, denn schliesslich könne die
Bank nicht beeinflussen, worin dieser investiert. Die Credit Suisse
hingegen ist der Meinung, ihr ausreichendes Nachhaltigkeitskonzept gebe
keinen Anlass zur Sorge und ihr Anteil am so genannten Tarsand sei
unbedeutend klein.
Die Erklärung von Bern (EvB)
fordert schon seit Jahren strengere Richtlinien für Geschäfte mit
ökologischen und sozialen Risiken, welche auch unbedingt öffentlich
publiziert werden müssen. Greenpeace schliesst sich diesen Forderungen
an und fordert von der UBS und allen weiteren in Palmöl, Papier- und
Zellstoffsektor investierenden Finanzinstitute:

Es müssen strikte Richtlinien zu Geschäften im Papier/Zellstoff- und Palmölsektor erarbeitet und  umgesetzt werden.
Diese Richtlinien sollen für sämtliche Geschäftsbereiche der Bank gelten und öffentlich einsehbar sein
Der Schutz von sogenannten «High Conservation Value Forests», «High
Carbon Value Forests» und «Peatlands» (Torfgebieten) muss gewährleistet
sein.

Finanzinstitute wie die UBS müssen von ihren Geschäftspartnern
zwingend ein nachhaltiges Geschäftsmodell einfordern. Falls jene dieser
Forderung nicht nachkommen und wie im Beispiel der Sinar Mas Gruppe mit
der Vernichtung von Regenwald und Torfmoorgebieten fortfahren, müssen
die geschäftlichen Beziehungen beendet werden.

",Report Exposes Burma-related Holdings in Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund,,,Shwe gas and pipelines projects ,oil and gas,Myanmar,"
A new report released today by EarthRights International finds the Norwegian government violating it own ethical guidelines with USD $4.7 billion invested in 15 companies in Burma connected to killings, forced labor, land confiscation around their project sites.New evidence and firsthand testimonies from inside Burma link companies in the Norwegian Government's investment portfolio to ongoing human rights abuses by the Burmese Army on behalf of the companies and their projects, putting Norway in violation of its own Ethical Guidelines for responsible investment. The 40-page report, entitled Broken Ethics: The Norwegian Government's Investments in Oil and Gas Companies Operating in Burma (Myanmar), draws heavily on clandestine investigations from inside Burma from 2008 - 2010. The report documents how the Norwegian Pension Fund-Global (Fund) - the world's second largest sovereign wealth fund, and a repository of the Norwegian peoples' oil wealth - has USD $4.7 billion invested in 15 oil and gas companies operating in Burma. The report documents how the companies are associated with grave abuses and an unreasonably high risk of future abuses. This puts the Fund in direct violation of its own standards for responsible investment and makes the Government of Norway complicit in the human rights abuses, according to EarthRights International, citing Norway's own standards of complicity.""Land confiscation, forced labor, and other abuses are happening now in connection to several large gas and oil pipeline projects in Burma,"" according to EarthRights International Program Coordinator Naing Htoo, an author of the report. ""There's every indication abuses connected to these projects will continue, and in some cases worsen. The new Shwe gas and oil pipelines to China are already linked to land confiscation and persecutions and are likely to contribute to renewed civil war in Shan State,"" he added. According to the report, the new pipelines will be constructed through politically contested territories in Shan State that are currently administered by non-state ethnic armies. The project is already under construction in Arakan State in western Burma.""We have no rights to speak out. Anytime they can do anything to us,"" said one ethnic villager in Arakan State quoted in the report, whose land was confiscated in 2010 for the Shwe gas pipeline project. The Fund has over USD $450 million invested in seven companies involved in the Shwe project, according to the report.The report explains Norway's standards to ensure its government is not complicit in serious abuses by companies in which it invests. In 2004, after a determined struggle by civil society and politicians, Norway established the Ethical Guidelines, a set of standards used to evaluate the ethics of the Fund's investments. If the government-appointed Council on Ethics determines a company's activities contribute to human rights violations or grossly unethical actions, or if there is an unreasonably high likelihood that the company's activities will contribute to future abuses, then the Council is mandated to recommend the Ministry of Finance either observe or exclude the company from the Fund.""This report presents a distinct opportunity for Norway to do what is intended by its Ethical Guidelines,"" said Matthew Smith, Senior Consultant with EarthRights International and an author of the report. ""Now is the time for the Council on Ethics to recommend that the Ministry of Finance act on these companies and restore Norway to its position as a global leader in ethical investment,"" he added.     EarthRights International refers to Norway's standards as ""clear, appropriate, and comprehensive."" Nevertheless, the report chronicles the Council's previous assessments of the Fund's investments in companies operating in Burma, and its past failures to take effective action. The report explains that in 2005 the Council recommended against excluding from the Fund the French oil company Total, operator of the Yadana gas pipeline, on the grounds that violent abuses in connection to the company's pipeline occurred in the past but were not continuing.EarthRights International, however, continues to document widespread forced labor and other violations by the Burmese Army on behalf of Total and its partners. In five of the last ten years, EarthRights International has documented targeted extrajudicial killings of villagers in the project area by Burmese Army battalions providing security for the Yadana pipeline, and the Yetagun pipeline that runs alongside it. The Fund has USD $3.6 billion invested in five companies involved in the Yadana and Yetagun projects.The report also explains that in a 2007 letter to the Norwegian Ministry of Finance, the Council on Ethics stated that if a company had an agreement with the Burmese authorities to construct new pipelines in Burma, that alone would be grounds for a company's exclusion from the Fund, due to the high risk of negative human rights impacts. According to EarthRights International's report, at least seven companies in the Fund's portfolio are presently involved in new pipeline construction in Burma.""The Council's inaction on the Fund's holdings in these companies puts the Norwegian people in an inconvenient position of complicity in grave human rights abuses in Burma,"" said EarthRights International's Matthew Smith. ""The Norwegian peoples' money is invested in corporate human rights abuses while the Ethical Guidelines go unapplied. The ethics are broken but not beyond fixing,"" he added.""The Burmese regime has long demonstrated itself as an unsuitable business-partner"", says Norway-based Steve Gumaer, the co-founder and International Executive Director of the humanitarian aid-organization Partners Relief & Development. ""Business ventures conducted through official channels in Burma directly support the regime's abuse of the ethnic populations and pro-democracy citizens in Burma today,"" Gumaer added. ""It is said that villages in North-Eastern Burma have benefitted by this sort of ‘economic engagement.' I have seen the devastating results; instead of schools, health & hygiene programs, and other community-development projects, are the ashes of villages that have been burned down. I have talked to women who were raped, men who were forced to serve as porters. I have heard first-hand accounts of brutal murders of anyone unwilling to go along with the regime's industrial or private business deals."" Partners Relief & Development stands with ERI in calling on the Council on Ethics to reconsider its position on companies operating in Burma's extractive sector.EarthRights International (ERI) is a nonprofit, nongovernmental organization that combines the power of law and the power of people in defense of human rights and the environment.  Focusing on earth rights, we work at the intersection of human rights and the environment.  We specialize in fact-finding, legal actions against perpetrators of earth rights abuses, training for grassroots and community leaders, and advocacy campaigns that seek to end earth rights abuses and promote and protect earth rights.

Amidst
much fanfare, French President Nicholas Sarkozy and senior World Bank and Asian
Development Bank officials are expected to attend a gala ceremony inaugurating
the Nam Theun 2
Hydropower Project in Laos this week. But for the tens of thousands of
people who are suffering the impacts of Nam Theun 2, there is little to
celebrate.
The
project has displaced 6,200 indigenous people on the Nakai Plateau and affected
more than 100,000 people living downstream along the Xe Bang Fai River. Funded
by the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and a host of other public and
private funders, among which banks that adopted the Equator Principles (ANZ, BNP Paribas, Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi-UFJ, Crédit Agricole CIB, ING, KBC,
Société Générale and Standard Chartered), Nam Theun 2 has been plagued with
controversy since it was first proposed in the 1990s.
34
civil society groups and individuals from 18 countries have written to the
World Bank and Asian Development Bank this week calling on the Banks to take
immediate action to ensure sustainable livelihoods for the affected
communities. Some of the issues raised by the groups include:

People on the Nakai Plateau
     still have no means for a sustainable livelihood, the dam  threatens their food security: as poor
     quality land in the resettlement sites continues to cause problems for
     villagers' agriculture, the long-term production of the reservoir
     fisheries is in doubt and outsiders are encroaching on the villagers'
     community forest areas;
Tens of thousands of people
     living downstream along the Xe Bang Fai River have already suffered
     impaired water quality and reduced fisheries, and funding is inadequate to
     restore their livelihoods;
A key selling point of the
     original project was that it would fund protection of the globally
     significant Nakai-Nam Theun National Protected Area, yet the reservoir has
     opened up access to the area, exacerbating logging and poaching and
     threatening its ecological integrity; and
Even though the project was
     supposed to improve standards for hydropower development more generally in
     Laos,
     there is little evidence that this has happened. Projects continue to be approved
     without disclosing environmental impact assessments and without adequate
     resettlement and livelihood improvement plans.

""The
Nam Theun 2's promoters are all too keen to call the project a success, but
many problems remain. The sustainable livelihoods of more than 120,000 people
directly affected by the project are far from guaranteed,"" said Ms. Ikuko
Matsumoto, Lao Program Director for International Rivers. ""What I've seen is
that dam-affected communities are struggling to adjust to their new lives and
that fair compensation has still not been paid to many people. It's way too
early to call this project a success.""
The civil society
letter concludes that ""Until the World Bank and ADB can prove that a hydropower
project of the size and scope of Nam Theun 2 can be successfully managed, we do
not believe that there is any justification for scaling up of World Bank or ADB
support for large dams.""
Professor
Philip Hirsch, Director of the Australia Mekong Resource Centre at the University of Sydney, said ""The World Bank and ADB have
indicated that the ""success"" of Nam Theun 2 is a basis for scaling up their
support for hydropower in coming years. Before - or rather instead of -
making any such move, the Banks have an obligation to the people and government
of Laos to live up to their promises and claims by ensuring that those affected
by Nam Theun 2 have sustainable livelihoods. To date the evidence does not
support the Banks' claims of success in this respect.""
Witoon
Permpongsacharoen, Director of the Mekong Energy and Ecology Network, said ""Given the
recent proposals for dams on the Mekong River's mainstream and other ongoing
destructive dam construction in the region, for example by some Chinese
companies, it is highly questionable whether the Nam Theun 2 has resulted in
any improvements to environmental and social standards in the region as the
World Bank and Asian Development Bank claim. These claims should be thoroughly
reviewed by an independent team.""

Paris, France ",Bankrun : solutions do exist,,,,,,"
Two month ago, Eric Cantona explained in a video that « the system is built on the power of banks » and that the « true revolution » will come the day when everyone withdraws his money from his bank to attack the system in its heart. While a group of citizens launched a massive call to do this today, Friends of the Earth France rather advises citizens who wish to participate to this ""bankrun"" to change bank definitely and/or to use their savings in a truly responsible manner. Indeed, solutions already exist and are presented on the website www.financeresponsable.org and in FoE France public guides.

Changing the banking system is necessary, as the financial crisis clearly showed in 2008. The search for short term profits and the financial markets irresponsibility had dramatic consequences for millions of people in the South as well as in the North, but states preferred to rush to the banks' aid, while they were responsible for the crisis. Faced with public decision makers' incapacity to regulate the international finance activities, Friends of the Earth France call every citizen to become aware of his power as a consumer and saver, and to use it to face the power of the banks. Money sleeping in a bank accomplice in the crisis can be withdrawn definitively from it and actively used for the creation of another, fairer system.
Even before taking place, this « bankrun » at least draws the attention on the banks, which are at the centre of the current economic model. Banks are so unavoidable in France, the country with the highest extension of banking services in the world, that it is for instance mandatory to have a bank account to receive social welfare. Juliette Renaud, private finance campaigner: ""Most people who will withdraw their money tomorrow will probably have to put it in another bank at one point, if they do not want to put it under their mattress. This could be the opportunity to think about the use of one's savings as a concrete means to go towards a model of society that would be more socially fair and environmentally sustainable."" There are indeed some responsible and transparent banking institutions, like La Nef, a solidarity financial cooperative which only invests in environmental, cultural and social projects. La Nef is still the only French financial institution that publishes the whole list of the projects it finances. Citizens can also invest directly in social economy small companies. All these solutions are presented and detailed on FoE France website specialized in private finance - www.financeresponsable.org - and in its two eco-citizen public guides ""Environment: how to choose my bank?"" and ""Environment: how to choose my savings?"".
FoE France has an active campaign on financial actors accountability, and denounces the hidden face of private banks and their scandalous practices: disastrous social and environmental impacts of their lendings and investments in dodgy deals and companies (coal power plant in South Africa for Crédit Agricole, tar sands in Canada for BNP Paribas, uranium mining in Malawi for Société Générale, among many other examples).
Juliette Renaud explains : ""On top of their irresponsibility on speculative markets, banks stay completely opaque on how they use their customers' money. They do not take into account the consequences of their activities on people and on the environment, as long as it does not represent a financial or reputational risk"". FoE France supports any citizen initiative aiming at questioning current practices of the banking sector, and which would push to the reorientation of the use of people's savings for the funding of projects needed for the transition towards low carbon economies.

Paris ",India to build nuclear reactors in earthquake zone with help from BNP Paribas,BNP Paribas ,France,Jaitapur nuclear power plant ,energy plants - nuclear,India,"
As French president Nicholas Sarkozy visits India in his role as salesman for the nuclear industry,
 Greenpeace activists today visited the headquarters of France’s BNP 
Paribas bank to tell it to stop its radioactive investment in new 
nuclear reactors.
The bank’s latest folly is to pump cash into the construction of two 
French-designed EPR nuclear reactors in the earthquake zone in India’s 
Jaitapur region. The area is crossed by three tectonic faults. Between 
1990 and 2000 there were three earthquakes there, all with a magnitude 
above five on the Richter scale. The Indian earthquake risk scale ranks 
areas from one to five. Jaitapur is classified as a four, meaning 
earthquakes can reach seven on the Richter scale. In 1993, the region 
experienced one earthquake reaching 6.3 leaving 9,000 people dead. 
Nowhere else in the world has a nuclear reactor been built in an area 
with seismic hazards of this magnitude.
In short, this is a crazy project. The opposition by the local people
 in Jaitapur is massive, mainly coming from the farmers and fishermen 
who refused the paltry financial compensation that the state wants to 
pay them to take ownership of their land. On Saturday nearly 10,000 people demonstrated at the Jaitapur site and 700 people were arrested.
It’s been reported that BNP will lead a syndicated loan of several 
billion euros, which should cover 70% of the financial needs of this 
dangerous project. The scandal is that BNP does not measure the risks to
 the environment or the local people because it knows the French and 
Indian governments guarantee the loan will be repaid no matter what. A 
nuclear accident will not threaten BNP’s investment, just the lives of 
those close by.
BNP has a history of a lack of transparency in its nuclear dealings. 
The bank did not respond to questions from concerned citizens about its 
financing of the new Angra reactor in Brazil. BNP is the first bank in 
the world to support the nuclear industry by funding hazardous projects 
and must provide full transparency in how it uses its customers’ money. It should also look to other nuclear scandals to see how reputations can be damaged.
The French nuclear industry is desperate to get a slice of India’s 
nuclear action and is slashing its costs accordingly. A contract to 
build two EPRs for 5.4 billion euros is being negotiated and yet the EPR
 currently being built in Finland costs 5.7 billion euros by itself 
after years of rocketing cost, schedule overruns, and thousands of 
construction defects.
So who will pay the difference? France guarantees the loans taken by 
Indian institutions from European banks in order to encourage India to 
buy these two reactors. It is a project with no financial risk for the 
banks but plenty for the poor French taxpayer who will have to put his 
hand in his pocket once again.
We invite citizens, and especially customers of BNP, to urge the bank to stop its radioactive investments. Is your bank investing in nuclear power? Find out at Nuclear Banks? No Thanks!. Read Greenpeace’s Jaitapur media briefing ‘EPR -- a nuclear problem not an energy solution’. "

Brussels ","Worst EU Lobbyists 2010 revealed- RWE, Goldman Sachs and ISDA",Goldman Sachs ,United States,RWE ,energy plants - coal | energy plants - nuclear | mining - coal ,Germany,"
RWE (npower), Goldman Sachs and derivatives
lobby group ISDA have been given the dubious honour of being named the Worst EU
Lobbyists of 2010. The results of the dual climate and finance categories of
the Worst EU Lobbying Awards 2010  were revealed today during a ceremony
outside the ISDA office in Brussels.
Citizens across Europe
participated in an online public vote for the most deserving of the climate and
finance nominees. Voters sent a clear message to EU transparency and ethics
Commissioner Maroš Šefcovic that a major clean-up of the Brussels lobbying scene is urgently needed,
and it's time the European Commission put public interest above the commercial
interests of large companies .
In the climate category ,
German energy giant RWE's subsidiary npower, nominated for claiming to be green
while lobbying to keep its dirty coal- and oil-fired power plants open, won
with 58% of the total vote. BusinessEurope, nominated for its aggressive
lobbying to block effective climate action in the EU while claiming to support
action to protect the climate, took second place with 24% of the total votes
and Arcelor-Mittal, the steel Industry ""fat cat"", came in third with 18% of the
total votes.
Nina Katzemich, speaking for the
organisers of the 2010 Worst EU Lobbying Awards, said: ""These awards show
that people around Europe are fed up with
deceptive lobbying practices used by big business when it comes to climate
regulation. RWE claims to be green but has pulled out all the stops to keep its
dirty power plants open, promoting their profits over public interests. If the
European Commission is serious about tackling climate change, it must stop
listening one-sidedly to corporations. It can make a new
start - now, in Cancun.""
In the finance category ,
Goldman Sachs and derivatives lobby group ISDA, nominated for aggressive
lobbying to defend their ‘financial weapons of mass destruction', took first
place with 59% of the total vote. Royal Bank of Scotland
(23%) took second, nominated for secretly lobbying in Brussels and for exploiting insider contacts.
Hedge funds and private equity lobby groups AIMA and EVCA (18%) took third, nominated
for deceptive lobbying to block regulation of damaging speculation in the financial
sector.
Paul de Clerck, speaking for the
organisers of the 2010 Worst EU Lobbying Awards, said: ""Despite the
unprecedented crisis following the financial meltdown, intense lobbying by
large banks and investment firms continues to delay and seriously water-down
much-needed regulatory reforms. While people around the world are suffering
severe consequences, corporate lobbyists are blocking any measure that could limit
the massive profits of banks. This is unacceptable. We call on the
European Commission to put an end
to the privileged access granted to big business, for instance limiting their
access to EU advisory groups on future financial regulation.""
The awards are part of an ongoing
campaign to expose and counter dirty lobbying tactics and privileged access
impacting on EU decision-making. For more information about this year's
nominees, and to follow future developments, please visit: www.worstlobby.eu

 Almost 8,000 voters sent the
message to Commissioner Maroš Šefcovic: ""The firms and lobby groups nominated
for the Worst EU Lobbying Awards 2010 have been able to undermine EU policies
for combating climate change and regulating the financial sector. We urge you
to take the necessary steps to ensure that the European Commission puts the
public interest above the commercial interests of large companies.""

Zuerich, Switzerland ",Success: Credit Suisse takes a step toward transparency,Credit Suisse ,Switzerland,,,,"
Bowing to civil society pressure, Credit Suisse for the first time
published summaries of its internal guidelines and instructions for
dealing with industries whose social and environmental record is cause
for concern. The Berne Declaration welcomes the bank's move towards
more transparency but at the same time regrets that human  rights
receive so little attention in the partly published guidelines.
For many years, the Berne Declaration has been researching and
documenting the involvement of large Swiss banks in business
transactions of customers who harm the environment and disregard human
rights. All along, the BD has been urging the banks to develop and
implement comprehensive rules for their involvment with high-risk
business operations, then publish them to invite public scrutiny. Now,
at long last, Credit Suisse has at least posted a summary of these
guidelines in the internet.
Unfortunately Credit Suisse did not have the courage to publish
their standards in full and thus become one of the leading banks in
terms of transparency. A look at the published summaries makes clear
that the guidelines contain no reference- indispensable in terms of
credibility and effectiveness-to the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights and ILO core labor standards. For example, Credit Suisse writes
that it will ascertain if a forestry company ""has considered and, if
applicable, responded to local community issues in a meaningful and
credible way"". However, most conflicts between forestry companies or
palm oil corporations and local communities do not concern vague
""commmunity issues"" but violations of human rights such as the right to
housing and the right to food, or the collective rights of minorities.
Therefore, the UN Special Representative for business and human
rights, John Ruggie, insists that all corporations develop procedures
to assess and reduce the negative impact of their activities on human
rights. To the extent that they are now publicly accessible the
guidelines of Credit Suisse are not sufficient for a serious assessment
of human rights. "

Laos ",Theun Hinboun expansion project marks breakthrough,BNP Paribas ,France,Theun-Hinboun dam expansion ,energy plants - dams,Laos,"
Excavation of the headrace tunnel at the
Theun Hinboun hydropower plant expansion project in Khammuan province cleared a
major hurdle on Sunday after almost a year of work.
Work on the tunnel, which is 5,250 metres
long, began in January this year with the use of the latest in excavation
machinery - the Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM). The machine meant excavation and lining
work was completed almost one month ahead of schedule. The project is the first
ever in Laos
to use the TBM. ""The headrace tunnel is the most difficult
part of the project,"" said Assistant Project Manager Mr Sisouvanh Souvannaphasy
at a ceremony to celebrate the breakthrough.
Excavation of the tunnel is not only one
of the most expensive parts of the project, but also involves unforeseen
critical processes. ""It involves expenditure of about 96.1
billion kip (US$12 million),"" Mr Sisouvanh said. ""Using the TBM, we can save time, money
and protect the environment and it's also more secure than using explosives."" The TBM allows an average of 21.66 linear
metres to be excavated per day.
The completion of the tunnel was the basis
for the on-time completion of the rest of the project. Construction of the
whole project is now 62 percent complete, after commencing in May last year. ""The tunnel is expected to be used to
generate energy by July 2012,"" Mr Sisouvanh said. Currently the installation of high voltage
power transmission lines is 67 percent complete, including the construction of
an 85km long 230 kilovolt (KV) line that will facilitate the export of
electricity to Thailand and a 51km long 115KV line that will be responsible for
supplying energy locally.
Building work on the Nam Ngouang and Theun
Hinboun powerhouses is now about 57 percent and 40 percent complete
respectively. The project is running on schedule, with all work expected to be
completed in June 2012. The Theun-Hinboun hydropower plant is
located in Borikhamxay province, with the expansion project underway in
Khammuan province. The expansion project will add a
generating capacity of 280 megawatts (MW) and is due to begin commercial
operation in July 2012.The project will cost the Theun-Hinboun
Power Company (THPC) around 6.2 trillion kip (US$720 million).
Sixty percent of the company is owned by
government shareholders, through Electricité du Laos, while Nordic Hydro
(Statkraft) and GMS Lao each hold 20 percent. The expansion project aims to improve the
distribution of energy both for local supply and export. It will also increase
generator capacity from 220 to 500MW, enabling the plant to produce more than
3,000 million kilowatt hours per year. Upon completion of the project, 440MW of
power will be sold to Thailand
with the remaining 60MW being sold to EDL for local supply. Currently the plant exports 95 percent of
its installed capacity of 220MW, with just 5 percent being put aside for local
supply.
THPC was the first independent hydropower
company in Laos,
beginning in 1995, and has operated successfully since 1998. According to the Energy Promotion and
Development Department of the Ministry of Energy and Mines, excluding the
mainstream Mekong River, Laos has the potential to generate
about 26,500MW from hydropower sources. Currently Laos has 15 power plants with a
total installed capacity of more than 2,170MW, according to a report from the
ministry's Planning and Statistics Division. "

Paris, France ",Lancement du premier calculateur de l’empreinte carbone de notre épargne,BNP Paribas ,France,,,,"
Le cabinet de conseil Utopies, l'association Les Amis de la Terre et le site web Mescoursespourlaplanete.com lancent aujourd'hui un outil en ligne inédit pour calculer l'empreinte carbone de l'argent déposé par les épargnants dans leur(s) banque(s). Contrairement à une idée reçue, les dépôts et placements des particuliers ne restent pas dans le coffre de leur banque : ils financent des activités économiques qui émettent des gaz à effet de serre. Ainsi 5 000 euros sur un compte courant polluent indirectement autant qu'un 4x4, sur une année !
Accédez à la calculette sur notre site : www.financeresponsable.org
Autrement dit : dans un contexte où 16 % des revenus des ménages français sont consacrés à l'épargne, manger bio, se déplacer à vélo plutôt qu'en voiture et prendre le train plutôt que l'avion a au bout du compte un impact limité sur l'environnement si parallèlement les banques placent l'argent du consommateur responsable, généralement à l'insu de celui-ci, dans des secteurs d'activité polluants comme l'extraction pétrolière, la construction de centrales à charbon ou la production d'automobiles polluantes.
Juliette Renaud, chargée de campagne sur la Responsabilité des Acteurs Financiers aux Amis de la Terre commente : « Les citoyens ne savent pas comment est employé l'argent qu'ils confient à leur banque ou à leur assurance, et leurs placements peuvent, malgré eux, participer à des dégâts environnementaux et sociaux. Il est temps de prendre conscience que nos choix d'épargne peuvent être un levier majeur pour agir sur la société et la transformer. » Et c'est une urgence : selon l'Agence Internationale de l'Energie (AIE), l'investissement annuel nécessaire pour financer la transition vers une économie sobre en carbone représente 7 fois le plan Marshall... mais moins de 1% du stock d'épargne mondiale !
Pour sensibiliser les consommateurs-épargnants à l'impact sur le climat de leurs choix bancaires (choix de la banque d'une part, choix des produits d'épargne d'autre part), le premier calculateur carbone sera en ligne à partir d'aujourd'hui sur les sites internet des partenaires de l'initiative. De plus, chaque gérant d'un site web pourra importer une version simplifiée du calculateur sous forme de bannière interactive et l'intégrer facilement sur sa propre page, à partir du site (non commercial) : www.epargneclimat.fr.
Les calculs ont été réalisés par le cabinet Utopies avec les données de la société Inrate. Ils évaluent les émissions de gaz à effet de serre directes (ex : bâtiments, ordinateurs...) mais aussi indirectes (ex : financement d'activités économiques, ...) des banques.
Les partenaires souhaitent ainsi sensibiliser l'opinion publique afin que les banques et le législateur soient incités à prendre en compte les enjeux climatiques dans la façon dont les produits d'épargne sont conçus et commercialisés. L'objectif est que les épargnants aient la possibilité d'épargner en épargnant la planète.
Des produits financiers verts existent déjà, comme le souligne Elisabeth Laville, fondatrice d'Utopies et du site Mescoursespourlaplanète : « Investis dans les énergies renouvelables par exemple, ils polluent dix fois moins que les produits d'épargne traditionnels et sont tout aussi rentables ».
Mais la plupart des grandes banques sont enfermées dans leurs habitudes. Elles préfèrent vendre leurs fonds et livrets maison très polluants mais auxquels les commerciaux et les clients sont habitués depuis des années. Créer et vendre des produits verts demande plus de pédagogie auprès des clients donc plus de formation des conseillers.
Stanislas Dupré, directeur général d'Utopies conclut : « Un nombre croissant de banques commence à s'intéresser à ce sujet, à mieux informer leurs clients et à proposer des produits financiers moins polluants, mais la route reste encore longue et le temps presse. Il est temps de passer à la vitesse supérieure !  »

Brussels ",Turkish dam policy discussed in EU,Akbank ,Turkey,Ilisu dam ,energy plants - dams,Turkey,"
Today the EU received unusual visitors from Turkey. Not high ranking
politicians or entrepreneurs from Ankara, but 20
representatives of anti dam movements from all regions of Turkey. They
delivered first hand reports to parliamentarians and the commission on
hydroelectric power plants and their devastating impacts on the people, nature
and cultural goods. And they spoke about their resistance. Together with China and Brazil,
Turkey
is the country with most hydroelectric projects in planning. The government of Turkey intends
to build approximately 1,500 additional dams and thus stop the flow of practically
every river in the country. ""The resistance against Ilisu grew to a resistance
against many more projects. The EU must support these initiatives and act upon Turkey to stop this flood of dams"", says Ulrich
Eichelmann from ECA Watch Austria.
Under the motto „Water
Politics in Turkey - A Challenge for EU-Turkey Relations"" a conference of
another type is taking place today in the European Parliament in Brussels.
European parliamentarians and representatives of the Commission received first
hand reports on the situation at the Turkish rivers. For once not the Ilisu dam
stood in the focus of attention, but many other projects which are mostly
unknown in the West. Approximately 20 affected persons from 13 Turkish
organisations spoke of planned dams, their impacts and the resistance against
them. They came from all parts of Turkey,
from the rivers Coruh, Yortanli (Allianoi), Munzur, Tigris,
Alakir, Loc, Yuvarlakcay. In these valleys alone 598 new dams are to
be constructed. Mrs. Pervin Coban Savran, representative of the nomads in the Taurus Mountains, told about the impacts of dams on her
people. The reservoirs destroy their pasture and cut off their traditional
migratory routes. Nonetheless, they were neither informed nor consulted.
The Turkish government
usually does not inform the affected people or assess the impacts on nature and
cultural goods as would be necessary. Ankara
intends to build more than 1,500 dams in the next 20-25 years. This would
entail the displacement of more than 100,000 persons, the destruction of almost
all ecological lifelines and cultural treasures. „The Turkish dam policies violate
European standards. We
ask the EU to support us in our engagement against the devastating flood of
dams in Turkey.
We need help"", said the representatives of the anti dam movements.
Participating
organisations: Alakir
 River Platform, Allianoi
Movement, Coruh Basin Conservation Union, Doga Dernegi, Free Munzur Initiative,
Green Artvin Society, Initiative to Keep Hasankeyf Alive, Loc River Platform,
TEMA Foundation, Turkish Water Assembly, Yuvarlakcay Platform.
The conference was
organized by ECA Watch Austria
and the European Greens and was supported of representatives of the
conservative, socialist and liberal parties.

Paris ",Prix pour Credit Agricole: les prix Pinocchio du développement durable 2010,Crédit Agricole ,France,,,,"
Les Amis de la Terre ont décerné le 9 novembre les Prix Pinocchio du développement durable 2010, sur la base des votes des internautes. Cette année, les lauréats sont le groupe Somdiaa dans la catégorie « droits humains », Eramet dans la catégorie « environnement », et le Crédit Agricole dans la catégorie « greenwashing ».
Dans la catégorie « droits humains » c’est le groupe Somdiaa, dirigé par la famille Vilgrain, qui a reçu le prix avec 32 % des votes dans sa catégorie, pour les impacts de ses activités de production et de transformation de canne à sucre, dont l’extension se fait aux dépens des communautés rurales qui voient leur sécurité alimentaire menacée. « Les Prix Pinocchio permettent de mettre en exergue les méfaits de certaines multinationales sur les conditions de vie et de travail des populations dans nos pays. Ainsi les habitants de Ndo espèrent que ce prix fera réagir Alexandre Vilgrain, PDG de la Somdiaa, et qu’il usera de son influence pour mettre un terme aux violations de leurs droits par sa filière camerounaise, la Sosucam » explique Yves Zoa, secrétaire général du Coden (1), organisation partenaire de Peuples Solidaires.
Le groupe Eramet a quant à lui reçu le prix Pinocchio dans la catégorie « environnement » avec 40 %. Les internautes condamnent la multinationale française pour le projet de développement de la mine de nickel de Weda Bay, en Indonésie. Ce cas illustre le double discours du groupe qui, loin de l’image d’ « entreprise citoyenne », vient d’obtenir une caution de la Banque mondiale pour un projet extractif à grande échelle dans les fragiles écosystèmes forestiers de l’île d’Halmahera. Bernard Salamand, président du Centre de recherche et d’information pour le développement, qui avait appuyé la candidature d’Eramet, se félicite de cette distinction et rappelle qu’ « une régulation contraignante des multinationales est d’autant plus cruciale s’agissant de l’utilisation ou de l’exploitation des ressources naturelles car la satisfaction de la consommation des pays du Nord entraîne une surexploitation de ces ressources au Sud, avec leur cortège de dégradations de l’environnement ».
Pour le « greenwashing » enfin, c’est le Crédit Agricole qui remporte le prix avec 56 % des votes. Lors de sa récente campagne de communication « It’s Time for Green Banking » la banque met en avant son « sens commun » alors qu’en août dernier, elle investissait dans la centrale à charbon de Medupi en Afrique du Sud, un projet polluant et décrié par la société civile internationale.
Les Amis de la Terre et leurs partenaires organisent chaque année les Prix Pinocchio du développement durable pour dénoncer le bilan désastreux de grandes multinationales en termes économiques, environnementaux et sociaux. Après le bilan décevant du Grenelle de l’Environnement, les pouvoirs publics français et européens peinent à encadrer de façon contraignante les activités des entreprises multinationales.
Pour Aloys Ligault, chargé de campagne pour la Responsabilité sociale et environnementale aux Amis de la Terre : « Les normes volontaires type ISO 26000 ne pourront jamais pallier à l’absence d’outils de régulation contraignante des entreprises multinationales. De combien de BP aurons-nous besoin pour que les pouvoirs publics prennent enfin leurs responsabilités ? ».

Zurich, Berlin, Vienna ",Ilisu Dam Turkey: Handing over of keys for new houses: a cynical act against international standards,Akbank ,Turkey,Ilisu dam ,energy plants - dams,Turkey,"
By symbolically handing over the keys for the houses
of New Ilisu, the Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan publicly celebrated not the
resettlement, but according to international standards the displacement of the
villagers.
Last Sunday October 31st , the Turkish Premier Erdogan
went to the tiny village Ilisu for a big ceremony. He handed over the keys for
the new pink houses. ""With nice slogans and glossy house facades the
Turkish government tries to cover-up that for building the Ilisu dam it is
sacrificing the livelihood of 75'000 people as well as unique cultural heritage
in the Tigris valley"", argues Christine Eberlein from Swiss Berne
Declaration. ""It is just marketing, but not substantial and sustainable dam
policy. If they continue with the construction of the dam, it will lead to a social, ecological
and cultural disaster,"" adds Ulrich Eichelmann from ECA Watch Austria.
What Erdogan kept
quiet about: the displaced will not stay long in their new houses, because no
reasonable income restoration measures are being planned and they will not be
able to afford to remain. No animal pastures or vegetable fields are available
in the rocky and desert like displacement area to support the families, living
up to now as subsistence farmers. Food supply and animal fodder is already a
problem as the ongoing construction works for the dam walls destroyed the pastures
and vegetable gardens along the river banks.""Even if we were getting
luxurious houses, how shall we survive without pastures for our animals and
without the fertile gardens which nourished our families?"" asks the mayor
of Ilisu, Mehmet Celik. On top, the new houses are not for free, he complains:
""After five years, we will have to buy them for double the price we
received for our old houses. Without income we will not be able to buy them but
end up in debts"".
Also further
upstream, in the ancient town of Hasankeyf, the very existence of the inhabitants
is under threat. After a rock-fall in summer 2010, the government closed off
the historical part and tourist attractions and informed tourist operators not
to visit. Measures to prevent further rock-falls, which would allow a
re-opening of Hasankeyf, are tellingly not
planned. As a result, Hasankeyf is faced with ruin. The creeping expropriation
and impoverishment of the dam affected people is already happening, long before
their land will be flooded.
""International
standards condemn such an approach as a prelude to forced displacement"",
comments Heike Drillisch from CounterCurrent, Germany. ""The Turkish
government violates human rights by conducting the resettlement process upside
down: first the income of the affected people has to be secured, only then can
construction of such a large project start."" Due to the continued failure
of the Turkish government to meet international standards, which was made
public by organisations like Berne Declaration, CounterCurrent and ECA Watch
Austria, the governments of Germany, Austria and Switzerland withdrew export
credit guarantees for the project in 2009.
While Prime
Minister Erdogan is determined to proceed with the Ilisu dam, resistance
against the project continues to rise. Citizens' initiatives throughout the
country, artist and academics protest against ""damming"" Turkey. The
University of Ankara presented an alternative plan consisting of five smaller
dams which would preserve Hasankeyf. Its
outstanding
cultural significance brought international attention to the affected
population's struggle to save its cultural heritage. ""The struggle is not
over and the dam is not built yet. We will continue to fight against this
project and to inform the international public about what is really going on at
the Tigris river"", announced Ulrich Eichelmann.
Ilisu and other dams in Turkey will be discussed at a conference in the European
Parliament on November 18th. Citizens' initiatives from various regions will
report on the environmental, cultural and social impacts of the ""tsunami
of dams"". The government in Ankara plans to build more than 1500
additional dams throughout the country.

San Fransisco, US ",Another big bank turns away from mountaintop removal!,UBS ,Switzerland,Mountain top removal coal mining ,mining - coal ,United States,"
I'm saying ‘Thank you' this week to PNC bank - which has just released its public position on Mountaintop Removal (MTR) Coal Mining.
Here's PNC's policy in full - and a key extract:

MTR is the subject of increasing regulatory and legislative scrutiny, with a focus on the permitting of MTR mines. While this extraction method is permitted, PNC will not provide funding to individual MTR projects, nor will PNC provide credit to coal producers whose primary extraction method is MTR.

We've been calling on PNC for many months to end their MTR financing, so I asked why the company made this new policy public. PNC responded that awareness of mountaintop removal and its impacts has been growing and that groups like RAN put the issue on their radar.
This move makes PNC bank number seven to issue a position on MTR, following in the footsteps of Bank of America, Citi, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Credit Suisse. You can read our assessment of these policies in RAN's report card on banks and MTR.
On the face of it, PNC's policy looks comparable with those released by the big Wall Street banks, but not as strong as the Credit Suisse policy - Credit Suisse has a complete exclusion on financing companies who engage in MTR coal extraction.
As with all bank policies, we'll understand what PNC's policy really means in practice as we monitor their financial dealings with the coal industry over the coming months. Until then we can only speculate, but let's base that speculation on what's happened previously. As the New York Times reported this August, neither Bank of America nor JPMorgan Chase (who both have positions similar to PNC's on MTR) has done business with Massey Energy since they adopted their policies.
In recent years, PNC has provided financing for six of the biggest MTR coal mining companies, earning them the title of ""US Leading MTR funder."" We're optimistic that this is now changing. "

Beijing, China ",Chinese NGOs announce third Green Banking Innovation Award,Industrial Bank ,China,,,,"

(September 2010, Beijing) Nine Chinese
NGOs presented the 2009 ""Green Banking Innovation Award"" and the ""Environmental
Information Disclosure Award"" to China Merchants Bank and Industrial Bank,
respectively.
The awards are part of the Economic Observer magazine's Best Chinese Banks annual awards
ceremony.  However, the jury is comprised
of nine independent NGOs including Green Watershed,
Friends of Nature, Institute of Public & Environmental Affairs, Green Earth
Volunteer, Global Environmental Institute, Civil Society Watch, China
Development Brief, Green Volunteer League of Chongqing and Hengduan Mountains
Research Society.  SynTao Co. Ltd., a
leading consulting firm in China
on corporate social responsibility, acted as an advisor to this award. 
In China, public environmental
awareness and the role and function of Chinese society in environmental
protection are gradually increasing. 
This award was established three years ago to encourage the Chinese
banking sector to fulfill their societal role to protect the environment, curb
emissions and climate change, and promote the green development that is
important to the public.  It is in-line
with the Chinese government's Green Credit Policy of 2007, which created a
blacklist of companies that should not receive loans from banks in China because
of their dismal environmental record. 
The jury first shortlisted nine Chinese
banks after examining the banks' 2009 corporate social responsibility
reports.  Next, banks were sent questionnaires,
of which four banks - China Merchants Bank, Industrial Bank, Standard Chartered
Bank and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank - completed the survey and Bank of
China and CITIC Bank provided some information. 
Of those, China Merchants Bank, Industrial Bank and Standard Chartered
Bank accepted face-to-face interviews. 
Additional information was sought from related domestic and foreign
media reports. 
The 2009 Green Banking Innovation Award
was based on the following 13 criteria: 
level of information disclosure; formulation of environment-related
policies; adoption of environment-related implementation measures; presence of
dedicated environmental departments or staff; the situation of ‘liang gao' lending; the situation of
energy-saving environmental protection lending; public opinion and critiques;
adoption of international standards and norms; the banks' internal
environmental performance; the banks' external advocacy and trainings; the
banks' social investments; and the situation of overseas investments.
The ‘Environmental Information Disclosure
Award' was developed to promote greater transparency and disclosure of
environmental policies and information. 
Award indicators included the means through which information was
disclosed; the circumstances under which information was disclosed; the
substance of information disclosure; bank responses to public demands, etc. "

Paris ",Greenpeace tells BNP-Paribas  ‘stop dangerous radioactive investments’,BNP Paribas ,France,Angra 3 nuclear power plant ,energy plants - nuclear,Brazil,"
This morning, Greenpeace activists in a number of European countries
(1) called on the international bank BNP Paribas to ""stop radioactive
investments"", including its plans to fund an obsolete, dangerous nuclear
reactor in Brazil. 
In Paris, Greenpeace activists used a BNP decorated armoured truck to
deliver millions of fake ‘radioactive BNP-Paribas notes' to AREVA's,
headquarters, the company that is building Angra
3, exposing the nuclear link between the two. 
The banking group, which provides more finance to nuclear industry
than any other bank in the world (2), is planning to provide crucial financing
for the construction of the nuclear reactor Angra 3, just 150 kilometres from Rio de Janeiro, as part
of a French banking consortium. The total amount that is reported to be
negotiated is €1.1 billion.  
""Angra 3 must be cancelled. It uses technology that pre-dates the
Chernobyl
nuclear disaster, and that would not be permitted for use in the countries that
are financing it. There has been no proper safety analysis and the legality of
the project is in doubt. It will not benefit the people of Brazil,"" said
Jan Beránek Greenpeace International nuclear campaigner. 
""BNP's customers have the right to know that their bank is misusing
their money. Brazil
does not need more nuclear electricity, it has abundant wind, hydro and biomass
resources for energy - all of which provide cheaper options without creating
environmental and health hazards,"" he continued. 
The construction of Angra 3 started in 1984 and stopped in 1986
following the Chernobyl
nuclear disaster, when banks withdrew their funding. Most of the equipment that
will be used to build the reactor pre-dates Chernobyl and has been left on the site for
the last 25 years. It is now dangerously obsolete. 
Angra 3 falls far behind current generation of reactor technologies,
which themselves suffer safety problems, construction delays and skyrocketing
costs. Any large-scale upgrades and adaptations required to integrate new
safety requirements will lead not only to higher construction costs, but also
increase the risk of unplanned outages during its operation. There are
additional safety concerns, such as, in its planning, there was no
risk-analysis carried out, in clear violation of international standards (3).
And, it is accessible only via one road, which frequently is blocked due
landslides.  As is the realty for all
nuclear reactors, there is still no permanent or safe solution for storing
hazardous nuclear waste, which remains lethal for millennia.  
""The financial players have been telling us for too long they are
not responsible for the direction of energy, it is a political problem. In
reality, it is they as well as manufacturers who allow these dangerous nuclear
projects to see the light of day,""said Sophia Majnoni d'Intignano, Greenpeace
France
nuclear campaigner.  
""It is high time that the banks fulfil their responsibilities.
Greenpeace calls on BNP Paribas to announce its immediate withdrawal from Angra
3 and allow full transparency on its radioactive investments.""  
Greenpeace launched this campaign on 16 October, when volunteers began
putting posters up around BNP branches and stickers on its ATM machines asking
the public: ""Do you know what your bank does with your money?""  
Notes to editors:
(1) Activities were also held in Luxembourg,
Russia and Turkey 
(2) BNP invested €13.5 billion in nuclear energy projects from
2000-2009. Profundo, independent investments consultancy research. Summary of
the findings, as well as full report, available at www.nuclearbanks.org
(3) International Atomic Energy Agency Safety Requirements stipulate
that the probabilistic safety assessment is performed and evaluated prior to
construction. This has not been done for Angra 3 as is pointed out in both the
official license from Brazil's
nuclear regulator CNEN (Comissão Nacional de Energia Nuclear)as well as from

",CS-Richtlinien sind: ein halber Schritt in die richtige Richtung,Credit Suisse ,Switzerland,,,,"
Die Credit Suisse hat auf
zivilgesellschaftlichen Druck dieser Tage erstmals Zusammenfassungen ihrer
internen Weisungen und Richtlinien für den Umgang mit sozial und ökologisch
problematischen Branchen publiziert. Die Erklärung von Bern begrüsst diese
überfällige Bewegung in Richtung mehr Transparenzbedauert aber zugleich, dass
die Menschenrechte darin nur unzureichend Beachtung finden.
 Seit Jahren recherchiert und dokumentiert die
EvB die Verstrickung der Schweizer Grossbanken in Geschäfte mit Kunden, welche
die Umwelt schädigen oder die Menschenrechte missachten. Aktuelle Beispiele für
Beihilfe zu Menschenrechtsverletzungen von UBS und CS dokumentiert die Website Banken und Menschenrechte. Ebenfalls seit
Jahren fordert die EvB von den Schweizer Grossbanken, dass sie umfassende
Richtlinien für den Umgang mit Hochrisiko-Geschäften entwickeln, diese umsetzen
und sich durch die Publikation dieser internen Richtlinien der öffentlichen
Debatte stellen. Die Credit Suisse hat nun immerhin eine Zusammenfassung davon
im Internet veröffentlicht (Zusammenfassung
der Credit Suisse Sektor-Weisungen und Richtlinien).
„Mit diesem unternehmensethischen „going
public“  macht die Credit Suisse einen
halben Schritt in die richtige Richtung“, sagt EvB-Bankenexperte Andreas
Missbach, . „Noch überzeugender wäre die vollständige Publikation der
Standards, so wie das andere internationale Banken wie die niederländischen
Rabobank oder die
britische Barclays Bank bereits
vorgemacht haben.“
Schon die Zusammenfassung zeigt, dass die
Weisungen im Bereich der ökologischen Fragen griffig sind und auf
internationale Standards abstützen. Bei den Menschenrechten allerdings fehlt
der für Glaubwürdigkeit und Wirksamkeit unabdingbare Bezug auf die
internationale Menschenrechtscharta und die ILO-Kernarbeitsnormen. So heisst es
etwa, die Credit Suisse werde darauf achten, dass ein Forstunternehmen „in
einer sinnvollen Weise Belange der lokalen Gemeinschaften in Betracht gezogen
(hat) und gegebenenfalls auf solche Belange eingegangen (ist)“. Bei Konflikten
zwischen Holzkonzernen oder Palmölproduzenten und lokalen Gemeinschaften
handelt es sich aber nicht um vage „Belange“ sondern darum, dass häufig die
Menschenrechte der vom Kahlschlag Betroffenen verletzt werden. Deshalb verlangt
der UNO-Sonderbeauftragte für
Unternehmen und Menschenrechte, John Ruggie, dass alle Unternehmen Verfahren
entwickeln, um die negativen Auswirkungen ihrer Aktivitäten auf die
Menschenrechte zu evaluieren und zu reduzieren.
Trotz dieser Mängel ist das grundsätzliche Bekenntnis der Credit Suisse
zu Transparenz wichtig und willkommen. Denn es sendet ein starkes und weithin
sichtbares Signal quer über den Paradeplatz. „Die UBS darf jetzt nicht ruhen,
bis sie die Credit Suisse durch die Veröffentlichung der vollständigen
Standards überholt hat“, kommentiert denn auch Andreas Missbach.

Tasmania, Australia ",Forests breakthrough: environment groups and forestry sector sign agreement,,,,,,"
A major breakthrough has
been achieved in the long running dispute over Tasmania's forests.  Timber communities, forest unions, industry and environment groups today
announced an agreement has been reached to develop a more sustainable timber
industry and end logging the state's remaining valuable native forests.  The ""Tasmanian Forests Statement of Principles"" sets the state's
timber industry on a new path to economic opportunities through
plantation-based forestry, protecting timber worker's jobs and native forests.  The in-principle agreement is the first step toward a lasting solution to more
than three decades of dispute over Tasmanian's forests. The groups involved
will now seek the support of both the Tasmanian and federal governments and
major political parties before a timeline for implementation is finalised.  The agreement involves industry moving out of native forest logging and into
suitable plantation forestry.  Under the agreement, a moratorium on the logging of high native forests will be
phased in over three months, while maintaining essential supplies for necessary
timber mill operations.   A major focus of the agreement is on establishing a competitive marketing edge
for the timber industry - producing more of the sustainable timber products
increasingly demanded by consumers - and the development of a range of
plantation-based down-stream processing facilities, including a pulp mill.
 
View the agreement here.  Signatories to the Agreement (alphabetical order): Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) The Australian Forest Contractor's Association (AFCA) The Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU) Environment Tasmania Inc (ET) The Forest Industries Association of Tasmania (FIAT) The National Association of Forestry (NAFI) Tasmanian Country Sawmiller's Federation (TCSF) The Tasmanian Forest Contractor's Association (TFCA ) Timber Communities Australia Ltd (TCA) The Wilderness Society (TWS)  For more information please contact:

San Fransisco, US ",A tale of two Swiss banks,Credit Suisse ,Switzerland,Mountain top removal coal mining ,mining - coal ,United States,"
We've been keeping our eyes on the Swiss alps as we fight to stop the destruction of Appalachia's beautiful mountains.
The reason? International banking giants provide major finance to some of the coal companies who blow up mountains to mine coal and the biggest global funder of mountaintop removal (MTR) is the largest Swiss bank, UBS.
Today we heard some good news from the other major Swiss bank, Credit Suisse, who has published summaries of their lending guidelines.
The exciting part for me is in the section ""Excluded Activities Involving Mining Companies"".Specifically, Credit Suisse says:
""iii. Mountaintop removal mining. Credit Suisse will not finance or provide advice on operations to extract coal or other resources where mountaintop removal mining practices are used.""
This is a full-sector exclusion and the best-yet published policy on MTR by any bank that we have seen. We already knew that this was Credit Suisse's position - they confirmed this to us in writing when we did our report card on MTR earlier this year. However, making this - and all their environmental lending policies - truly public is a major step forward in transparency for the bank.
All eyes are now on UBS to see whether they will keep up with their banking competitor. UBSrecently commented, on Swiss radio station WRS, that ""we are currently reviewing our risk management approach involving transactions with MTR companies and are in discussions with stakeholder groups.""
Credit Suisse's full list of summaries is available here. This includes policies on oil & gas, hydropower, forestry& forest products and palm oil. "

Sydney, Australia ",Greenpeace illuminates ANZ as Australia's dirtiest bank,ANZ ,Australia,,,,"
Tuesday 19th October - Greenpeace launched a new 
campaign to illuminate the role of ANZ as the biggest financier of 
polluting coal power in Australia.
Greenpeace activists projected a redesigned ANZ logo and tag 
line ""We Pollute Your World"" onto a cooling tower at Yallourn - the 
third most polluting power station in Australia and one of ten across 
the country financed by ANZ over the last five years.
A new report we commissioned exposed the role the big four banks play in propping up pollution. While Commonwealth, NAB and Westpac are all big dirty players, ANZ is the largest financer of coal in Australia.
Over the past five years, ANZ has poured nearly $1.6 billion 
dollars into coal infrastructure and is the biggest financier of coal 
power stations and coalmines.
This is despite ANZ topping the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for 
four years running and adopting a policy to be carbon neutral.
""ANZ have made much of its environmental awards,"" said Greenpeace 
campaigner, John Hepburn. ""But these are meaningless if the bank 
continues to pour billions into financing pollution.""
""We are at a major turning point,"" said Hepburn. ""Today, we are 
faced with a new generation of 12 new polluting coal plants in the 
pipeline. That's why we are asking ANZ CEO, Mike Smith, to commit not to
 finance new coal power stations in Australia.""
We're calling on ANZ to stand with the Australian community 
and make a commitment not to invest in new coal power. It has the power 
to lead us towards a clean energy future. "

Hasankeyf, Turkey ","Protest camp against the Ilisu Dam in Hasankeyf, Turkey",Akbank ,Turkey,Ilisu dam ,energy plants - dams,Turkey,"
From October 11th until Sunday,
October 17th, a protest camp against the construction of the Ilisu
Dam has been set up on the banks of the Tigris river in the antique town of Hasankeyf in
South-Eastern Turkey. Approximately 150 people, mostly from the surrounding
region, have visited the camp every day. But there are also participants from New Zealand, France,
Germany and Austria
to protest against the construction of the Ilisu dam. The event aimed to inform
about the project, additional events and actions have been planned, and lawyers
have given advice to the local population about their legal rights.
""The camp is an important
sign of resistance from within the Ilisu region. Even though construction
activities continue, there is hope for the rescue of Hasankeyf,"" said
Ulrich Eichelmann from ECA Watch Austria, who is currently in
Hasankeyf. Just recently ""Aksiyon"", one of the most popular magazines
in Turkey
called for the implementation of an alternative model to the current plans to
build the Ilisu dam. The magazine sited a study by the renowned Technical
University of Ankara, which shows how Hasankeyf and parts of the Tigris valley can be saved by the construction of five
smaller dams.
If the Ilisu dam is built
according to current plans, more than 400 kilometres of the Tigris
river and its tributaries, habitat for some globally endangered species and so
far undiscovered flora and fauna, will be destroyed. Endemic species will be
extinct and a unique ecosystem will be lost forever. Ten thousands of people
will be displaced, and the ancient city of Hasankeyf will disappear in a gigantic
reservoir, together with more than 200 other highly valuable archaeological
sites. "

Paris ",Medupi (South Africa): Crédit Agricole finances a climate destructive coal project,Crédit Agricole ,France,Medupi coal power plant ,energy plants - coal,South Africa,"
In spite of a global civil society campaign, Crédit Agricole has recently approved a 63,7 millions euros loan to Eskom in South Africa, for the construction of the gigantic Medupi coal power plant. In April 2010, Les Amis de la Terre had already condemned the World Bank decision1 of financing the same project, which will have heavy impacts on the climate and the local environment, and that will not at all improve the access to electricity for South African people. Les Amis de la Terre condemn this transaction and demand that Crédit Agricole withdraw immediately from this project.
For many months, a coalition of more than sixty South African organizations, as well as about a hundred civil society organizations from the whole world, including Les Amis de la Terre, denounce the devastating effects that Medupi huge coal power plant (4800 MW) will engender. Once constructed, this coal power plant will emit 25 millions tonnes of carbon dioxide per year, coal being the most harmful fossil fuel for climate change because of important CO2 and methane emissions.
This project has been conceived to meet the industrial sector needs, and will firstly benefit to the export-led transnational companies, mainly mining companies. On the one hand, the start of this coal power plant will drive the opening of 40 new carbon mines in South Africa. On the other hand, the generated energy will feed the mining industry, which acknowledges itself as being one of the most important consumers of energy in the country, and moreover enjoys it from preferential fees. Juliette Renaud, Financial Actors Accountability campaigner at Les Amis de la Terre, denounces: ""It is all just so much nonsense: the mining companies of the carbon sector exploit this fuel to feed Eskom power plants, that will then supply with energy the mining projects of these same transnational companies. Crédit Agricole must immediately cease financing this vicious circle that has such environmental and social disastrous consequences.""
Moreover, South African people will have to carry the burden of this new investment: Eskom has already planned an increase in monthly electricity fees for South African households between 2009 and 2012, from 48 to 130 dollars, an increase that will make energy unaffordable for the poorest and will heavily weigh on all private individuals. In addition, local communities will have their health heavily affected because of the exposure to mercury residue linked to production of electricity by coal, and because of pollution provoked by the carbon extraction in the new mines.
And yet, South Africa has abundant renewable energy resources, including onshore and offshore wind and solar power. This potential offers the opportunity for South Africa to transition towards a low carbon power sector and economy. Yann Louvel, referent for Les Amis de la Terre Financial Actors Accountability campaign, concludes: ""Taking up Crédit Agricole's own catch phrase ""It's time for green banking"", and not for greenwashing2. Banks should declare a moratorium in financing new coal-fired power plants, and instead support opportunities for energy efficiency improvement and for the strengthening of the renewable energy sector.""
1The World Bank inspection panel has accepted the validity of a complain presented by two South African NGO, and is carrying out an investigation.

Paris ",Medupi (Afrique du Sud) : le Crédit Agricole finance un projet charbonnier climaticide,Crédit Agricole ,France,Eskom ,energy plants - coal | energy plants - nuclear,South Africa,"
En
dépit de la campagne mondiale d'opposition de la société civile,
le Crédit Agricole a approuvé récemment un prêt de 63,7 millions
d'euros à la compagnie Eskom en Afrique du Sud, pour la construction
de la gigantesque centrale à charbon de Medupi. Les Amis de la Terre
avaient déjà condamné en avril 2010 la décision de la Banque
Mondiale1 de financer ce même projet aux impacts très lourds pour le climat
et l'environnement, et qui n'améliorera en rien l'accès à
l'électricité de la population sud-africaine. Les Amis de la Terre
condamnent donc cette transaction et demandent le retrait immédiat
du Crédit Agricole de ce projet.
Depuis
de nombreux mois, une coalition de plus de soixante organisations
sud-africaines, ainsi qu'une centaine d'organisations de la société
civile internationale, dont les Amis de la Terre, dénoncent les
effets dévastateurs que causera la méga-centrale à charbon de
Medupi (4800 MW). Une fois construite, cette centrale émettra 25
millions de tonnes de CO2 par an, le charbon étant le combustible
fossile le plus nocif pour les changements climatiques via
d'importantes émissions de CO2 et de méthane.
Ce
projet a été conçu pour répondre aux besoins du secteur
industriel, et profitera en premier lieu aux multinationales
étrangères tournées vers l'exportation, principalement les
compagnies minières. Ainsi, d'une part, la mise en marche de cette
centrale impliquera la nécessité d'ouverture de 40 nouvelles
mines de charbon en Afrique du Sud. D'autre part, l'énergie générée
viendra alimenter l'industrie minière qui se reconnaît comme l'un
des plus importants consommateurs d'énergie du pays, et bénéficie
de plus de tarifs préférentiels. Juliette Renaud, chargée de
campagne Responsabilité des Acteurs Financiers aux Amis de la Terre,
dénonce : ""On
en arrive à un constat de la plus grande absurdité : les compagnies
extractives du secteur du charbon exploitent ce combustible afin
d'alimenter les centrales d'Eskom, qui vont à leur tour
approvisionner en énergie les différents projets miniers de ces
mêmes multinationales. Le Crédit Agricole doit immédiatement
cesser de financer ce cercle vicieux aux conséquences
environnementales et sociales plus que désastreuses"".
De
plus, la population sud-africaine devra supporter la charge de ce
nouvel investissement : Eskom prévoit d'ores et déjà une
augmentation des tarifs mensuels de l'électricité de 48 à 130
dollars pour les foyers sud-africains entre 2009 et 2012, ce qui
rendra l'énergie inabordable pour les plus pauvres et pèsera
lourdement sur tous les particuliers. Par ailleurs, les populations
locales verront leur santé lourdement affectée en raison de
l'exposition aux résidus de mercure liés à la production
d'électricité à base de charbon, ainsi que des différentes
pollutions provoquées par l'extraction de charbon dans les nouvelles
mines.
L'Afrique
du Sud a pourtant un fort potentiel de développement des énergies
renouvelables, notamment l'énergie éolienne et solaire. Ces
ressources permettraient à ce pays d'effectuer une transition vers
un secteur énergétique et une économie sobres en carbone. Yann
Louvel, référent de la campagne Responsabilité des Acteurs
Financiers aux Amis de la Terre conclut: ""Pour
reprendre un slogan du Crédit Agricole lui-même : ''It's time for
green banking'' et non pour le greenwashing2. Les
banques devraient déclarer un moratoire des financements de
nouvelles centrales à charbon et soutenir à la place les
opportunités d'amélioration de l'efficacité énergétique et de
renforcement du secteur des énergies renouvelables"".

London ","British banks complicit in Nigerian corruption, court documents reveal",Barclays ,United Kingdom,,,,"
British high street banks have accepted millions
of pounds in deposits from corrupt Nigerian politicians, raising serious
questions about their commitment to tackling financial crime, warned Global Witness in a report
published today. By taking money from corrupt Nigerian governors between
1999 and 2005, Barclays,
NatWest, RBS, HSBC and UBS helped to fuel corruption
and entrench poverty in Nigeria.
What is so extraordinary about this story is
that nearly all of these of these banks had previously fallen foul of the UK banking regulator, the Financial Services
Authority (FSA), in 2001 by reportedly helping the former Nigerian dictator
Sani Abacha funnel nearly a billion pounds through the UK. These banks
were supposed to have tightened up their systems but as this
report now shows, a few years later, they were accepting corrupt Nigerian
money again. There is no sign that the FSA has taken any action this time.
Global Witness's new report, International Thief Thief,
is based on analysis of court documents from litigation in London by the
Nigerian government to get funds returned from the UK that were stolen by two
former state governors. British banks made it possible for Dieypreye
Alamieyeseigha of Bayelsa State and Joshua Dariye of Plateau
State to bring their corrupt loot into
the UK.
""Banks are quick to penalise ordinary
customers for minor infractions but seem to be less concerned about dirty money
passing through their accounts,"" said Robert Palmer, campaigner at Global
Witness. ""Large scale corruption is simply not possible without a bank
willing to process payments from dodgy sources, or hold accounts for corrupt
politicians,"" he added.
One of the banks profiled in the report is RBS,
now majority owned by the taxpayer. RBS allowed former governor Alamieyeseigha
to receive bribes and bring £2.7 million into the UK. An English High Court judge
found that at least £1.56 million of these funds were bribes paid by a state
contractor called Ehigie Edobor Uzamere, currently a Nigerian senator, in order
to win a contract to build a fence around the governor's official lodge. Global
Witness has asked RBS whether it carried out adequate checks on its customer
and his funds, but has not had a reply.
""It adds insult to injury that not only are
ordinary taxpayers propping up failing banks, but that one of these banks has
facilitated corruption in Nigeria, a country where more than half the
population are still without access to clean water. This undermines British
development aid, which fills the gaps created by poor governance and failing
state services,"" said Palmer.
Global Witness is concerned that banks and the
FSA have yet to take this problem seriously enough. Anti-money laundering
regulations require banks to identify their customers and the source of funds,
but they are not being adequately enforced. Banks need to get much better at
checking where the money is coming from and whether it was obtained through
corrupt practices. The banks in this report may not have broken the law, but corrupt
money still entered the UK
and so our financial system is still complicit in corruption.
This is an ongoing problem, as shown by the
action taken against HSBC by the US regulators last week. They
required HSBC's American arm to overhaul its due diligence systems following
violations of US anti-money laundering laws and inadequate monitoring of
transactions and customers, including ‘politically exposed persons' - ie the
foreign senior officials who could be involved in corruption.
The British coalition government plans to
abolish the FSA. Whatever body replaces it must take corruption seriously. The
government and the new regulator must send a clear signal to the financial
sector that corrupt money is not welcome. And the banks themselves must demonstrate
much more clearly the steps they are taking to stop dirty money entering the
financial system.

Sydney, Australia ",NAB the bank with STD*,National  Bank (NAB) ,Australia,,,,"
In an era where banks
are trying to look like good corporate citizens - the National Australia Bank
has an unenviable record when it comes to supporting mines that
dump their waste into rivers and oceans.
""The use of submarine or riverine tailings
disposal is not an acceptable method of mine waste disposal"" said Charles
Roche, Executive Director of the Mineral Policy Institute
""Any bank that supports the use of
riverine or submarine tailings disposal fails the test of corporate social responsibility.""
""Despite their commitment to
sustainability the Equator Principles and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational
Enterprises, the NAB is investing in riverine and submarine tailings disposal.""
""Australia should be embarrassed
about the investment strategies of a bank that bears our name, clearly NAB has a
history of investing in environmentally destructive mining operations in PNG and
Indonesian-Papua.""
""Whether you are an individual or
a company, you should invest your money in a bank that does not support the dumping
of mine waste into rivers, oceans or seas.""
 
*STD, submarine tailings disposal
involves the pumping of mine tailings into the sea via submerged pipelines. The mining industry prefers the
term deep sea tailings placement or DSTP.

Temacapulin, Mexico ",Mexican village becomes global hub of dam fighting for a week,,,,,,"
This week, more than 300 people
from 60 countries will gather in the small village of Temacapulín, Mexico,
for ""Rivers for Life 3,""
a global gathering of dam-affected people and their allies. From October 1-7,
Temacapulin will almost double in size and become the hub of the global
movement to protect rivers from the ravages of destructive dams. ""Rivers
for Life 3 will bring together people whose lives have been harmed by dams,
activists, and experts in clean energy and sustainable water projects from all
corners of the globe. Participants will share experiences and strategize on how
to protect their rivers and rights. Indigenous people from the Amazon will
mingle with farmers from the Zambezi
 River, providing a unique
opportunity to build connections across cultures,"" said Aviva Imhof,
Campaigns Director of International Rivers.
The people of Temacapulín are
looking forward to strategizing and networking with people facing struggles similar
to their own. The village, located on the Rio Verde, is fighting a large dam
that would flood the entire town. It is one of Mexico's longest-inhabited towns.
""The whole village of Temacapulín
is against the El
Zapotillo Dam. This meeting is very important for Temacapulin and for the
Mexican movement against dams. We have tried many ways to stop the dam but the government
is completely deaf to our voices,"" said Marco von Borstel, of IMDEC, the
Mexican Institute for Community Development and one of the organizers of the
event. ""This meeting can help not only in the campaign to stop the El Zapotillo Dam, but to educate the media and
the people of Mexico
that dams are not a sustainable form of development. We need to get water and
energy without killing rivers and flooding historic towns like Temacapulín.""
Today, a cover story in the
journal Nature brought even greater
urgency to the global struggle to protect rivers. The magazine reports that the
world's rivers are in crisis, suffering from the cumulative impacts of dams, pollution,
agricultural runoff, the conversion of wetlands and the introduction of exotic
species.
The report reveals that 80% of the
world's population - nearly 5 billion people - lives in areas where river
waters are highly threatened. Global water security and the health of aquatic
environments that support thousands of species are at risk.
Those gathering now in Temacapulín, Mexico have first-hand knowledge
about the high cost of damaged rivers, and the value of preserving life-giving
waterways.
""We are going to the meeting
to develop initiatives and common tactics to stop the companies that are
evicting us from our lands. In addition, we want to raise awareness of the
widespread opposition to the current energy model and its consequences on
people and rivers, and discuss proposals for a new energy model,"" said Josivaldo
de Oliveira, of the Brazilian Movement of Dam-Affected People (MAB).
The week-long meeting will include
workshops on clean energy alternatives, best-practice river management strategies,
and policy challenges; a community fair to showcase highlights from the various
dam struggles represented at the meeting; and field trips to relevant sites in
the region.
This is the third international
meeting of people affected by dams. Similar meetings were held in Curitiba, Brazil
in 1997, and in Rasi Salai,
 Thailand in
2003. "

Hasankeyf, Turkey ",Call for Hasankeyf Solidarity Camp between 11-17 October 2010,Akbank ,Turkey,Ilisu dam ,energy plants - dams,Turkey,"
We, the Initiative to Keep Hasankeyf Alive, call on all concerned individuals and organizations to participate in and support our planned 'Hasankeyf Solidarity Camp' which will take place on 11-17 October 2010 in Hasankeyf in the Tigris Valley, which is threatened by the construction of Turkey's destructive Ilisu Dam Project.The Ilisu Dam project will submerge the magnificent cultural and natural richness of the ancient city of Hasankeyf and severely impact the Tigris Valley downstream. Some 75.000 thousand will be evicted to make way for the project. Construction work has been going on since the spring of 2010 in the village nearest to the dam and in a resettlement site at ""New Hasankeyf"". In spite of protests by the affected local peoples and widespread criticism from people and organizations both in Turkey and internationally, this destructive project is still being carried out!The Turkish authorities initially sought - and obtained - finance for the dam from international financial institutions. However, as a result of both the strong protests against the project, and the failure of the Turkish authorities to abide by agreed international standards for such projects, European companies, banks and governments declared that they would withdraw their financial and participation support in July 2009. In the following months, Turkey failed to obtain finance for the Ilisu project - one of the most controversial and contested dam projects currently planned internationally - from the Chinese government or from the companies involved in the project. Despite this, three Turkish banks (Akbank, Garantibank and Halkbank) agreed to fund the dam, whose construction has now become a matter of prestige for the current Turkish government, in January-February 2010. Four Turkish companies and Austria's Andritz remain in the project. Beyond that another critical development is the measure taken after a rock fall on July 13th, 2010 in the old bazaar of Hasankeyf whereby a person died: The ancient city ofHasankeyf is completely closed to any visits which is the first step of ""unmanned Hasankeyf policy"", a pre stage for depopulation.So our struggle against the Ilisu project, which will destroy the livelihoods of 75 thousand people and flood forever the 12.000 years-old cultural-natural heritage of Hasankeyf, a site which meets the nine out of ten UNESCO World Heritage criteria, and drastically alter the rich eco-system of the Tigris with its myriad species of flora and fauna, has entered to its final phase.Other dams in Turkey have previously destroyed the towns and cultural sites of Samsat, Halfeti, Zeugma and Hallan Cemi - all for a tiny amount of electricity production. Now other similar destructive projects are being constructed in Hasankeyf, Allianoi, Munzur and the Black Sea Region. If we do not stand up against these projects, we will end up losing these treasures too.Even though at first almost everyone considered our struggle unrealistic, our campaign, based on ""protection against destruction"", ""living in harmony with nature against being separated from it"", ""local development against migration"", ""production against consumption"", and ""solidarity against individualism"", has managed to halt the Ilisu Dam project twice. Despite the fact that the construction works has once more restarted, we call, with the faith of having the power to cancel this project, everyone from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, from the Aegean toMesopotamia and concerned people all over the world to participate in the October camp and build solidarity with our struggle.Local communities, cultures and natural resources should not be destroyed for the economic benefits of vested interest groups! The conservation of Hasankeyf and the Tigris Valley - which have become very important symbols in our country against the destruction caused by Turkey's current dam-building policy - should be seen as our common mission...Let us carry Hasankeyf to the future, instead of to its planned resettlement area!
Therefore, for the purpose of building solidarity with Hasankeyf, we will organize a solidarity camp in Hasankeyf on the Tigris River on 11-17 October 2010. We invite you to participate to this camp to get your support and reflections for our struggle   "

São Paulo - Brazil ",Mais de 100 organizações alertam BB sobre financiamento para Belo Monte,,,Belo Monte dam ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"
Mais de 100 organizações da sociedade civil brasileira
e internacional enviaram uma notificação extrajudicial ao Banco do
Brasil nesta terça-feira (21), cobrando que o banco não financie a
usina hidrelétrica de Belo Monte, no rio Xingu (PA).
O documento levanta
os diversos problemas socioambientais e de direitos humanos que a usina
de Belo Monte deve causar, como impactos na qualidade da água ou a seca
que a usina causará na Volta Grande do Xingu, onde vivem centenas de
famílias que dependem do rio para sobreviver, além de problemas no
processo de licenciamento da usina.
Segundo
Roland Widmer, coordenador de Eco-Finanças da organização Amigos da
Terra - Amazônia Brasileira, o projeto atual de Belo Monte violaria a
Constituição, que reconhece aos índios os direitos originários sobre as
terras que ocupam, inclusive as utilizadas para suas atividades
produtivas.
""Quem financiar Belo Monte se
tornará, automaticamente, responsável solidariamente por todos os danos
ambientais que vierem a ocorrer.   os
financiadores poderão ser responsabilizados por todos os custos
decorrentes dos impactos sobre a fauna, flora e pessoas da região. 
Além disso, a reputação dos financiadores sofrerá grandes danos.  Seria
muito imprudente para uma instituição como o Banco do Brasil assumir
tamanhos riscos.  Diante disso, quero acreditar que o BB pondere esses
riscos devidamente na sua tomada de decisão e não financie Belo Monte"",
diz Widmer.
A notificação ressalta que o Banco do
Brasil assinou compromissos voluntários pelo desenvolvimento
sustentável e preservação ambiental, como o Protocolo Verde e os
Princípios do Equador, e o financiamento de Belo Monte não respeitaria
os critérios de nenhum desses compromissos.
Além
da Amigos da Terra - Amazônia Brasileira, aderiram à notificação
organizações como Greenpeace, Movimento Xingu Vivo para Sempre,
International Rivers, Instituto Socioambiental (ISA), Associação de
Defesa Etnoambiental Kanindé e BankTrack, entre as mais de 100
organizações e grupos.
Financiamento do BB
No dia 10 de setembro, uma reportagem publicada no jornal Valor Econômico afirmou que o Banco do Brasil seria, junto com o BNDES, o grande financiador de Belo Monte.
Segundo
fontes ligadas ao consórcio que vai construir a usina, o BNDES havia se
comprometido a financiar 80% do total da obra, mas pelas regras do
Acordo de Basiléia não pode emprestar diretamente mais do que R$ 14,5
bilhões.  O Banco do Brasil teria se comprometido a completar os R$ 20
bilhões estimados para o financiamento da usina, emprestando R$ 5,5
bilhões.
No dia 13 de setembro, o Banco do Brasil afirmou,
por sua assessoria de imprensa, que não existe, até o momento, qualquer
proposta de financiamento da usina hidrelétrica de Belo Monte sob
análise, ou operações já realizadas com o consórcio de construção da
usina.
""Como participante de grandes operações de
investimento, o Banco do Brasil acompanha com interesse o projeto, e
pode eventualmente analisar futuras propostas.  Entretanto, nenhuma
solicitação foi protocolada no banco, não existem análises técnicas em
curso e nenhuma decisão foi tomada sobre financiamentos concedidos a
empresa concessionária"", diz a nota emitida pela assessoria do banco.

Amsterdam ",European banks provide fuel for the conflict in Sudan,Banco Santander ,Spain,,,,"
This week president Obama is attending a
United Nations summit on Sudan
in order to direct attention to the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis in
Darfur. Last year ING, BNP Paribas and Deutsche
Bank together owned almost € 150 million of shares in PetroChina, one of the
most important players in the oil industry in Sudan fuelling the conflict. This
alarming example in the SOMO publication ‘Investing
Responsibly: A Financial Puzzle', which is published today, illustrates the
need to seriously alter the way banks approach their asset management policy.
The SOMO study into the investment policy of European banks reveals that the
scope of the banks' Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policy is
characterized by severe limitations. A coherent application of CSR policies to
all business activities is
lacking and their level of transparency is still a far cry from reality. 
Two main topics are addressed in the new SOMO
study; first the existence, scope and application of CSR policies with regard
to asset management, especially concerning mainstream investment portfolios,
and secondly, the level of transparency of these CSR policies. The study
focuses on five large European banks: ING Group, RBS Group, Deutsche Bank, BNP
Paribas and Santander Group. In order to provide a broader picture of
alternatives on the market, two other Dutch banks were included in the study,
Triodos Bank and SNS REAAL.
The SOMO publication shows that CSR has
indeed found its way into the financial sector, but unfortunately most of the
banks in the study only apply CSR policies to a very limited portion of the
assets invested. ""As only the arms industry is so evidently and directly
connected with unsustainable practices, some banks exclude this sector from all
their investments"", explains SOMO researcher Roos van Os. ""On other issues,
such as human rights and climate change, the major European banks do have their
own CSR policies, but they do not apply the criteria laid down in these
policies to asset management"". With the exception of Triodos Bank and SNS
REAAL, a consistent application of CSR policies to mainstream investment
portfolios is absent.
Transparency regarding the policies applied
is often lacking as well: while consumers can choose sustainable investment
products at any bank, it is often difficult to determine the extent to which
CSR policies apply to the institutions' mainstream investment portfolios. Banks
publish sustainability reports with far-reaching promises on the integration of
CSR into their core and non-core activities. ""It is of utmost importance that
outside stakeholders, such as consumers, citizens and societal organisations,
can assess whether banks live up to their CSR commitments and objectives. In
this respect, accountability and transparency are needed to evaluate whether
actual practices accord with the stated policies"", according to Van Os.
A consistent CSR policy and transparency are
widely regarded as crucial elements if consumers are to recover trust in the
financial sector after the recent turbulent years. In order to regain trust and
live up to sustainable expectations, banks must be truly transparent about the
scope of their CSR policies and whether these policies are applied to asset
management. "

Paris ",Finance responsable : Les Amis de la Terre enterrent l’ISR,,,,,,"
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 

Les Amis de la Terre publient aujourd'hui le rapport Investissement socialement responsable : l'heure du tri (1) qui analyse la composition des fonds dits ""éthiques"" ou ""ISR"" (Investissement socialement responsable) et met ainsi en lumière l'écart entre la promesse des intitulés et la réalité des faits. Ces fonds sont en effet investis dans des entreprises multinationales ayant des pratiques sociales et environnementales désastreuses. La publication du rapport s'accompagne de la sortie du guide éco-citoyen ""Environnement : comment choisir mon épargne ?"" (1) qui montre que de réelles alternatives existent, à commencer par les investissements solidaires.
Les Amis de la Terre ont étudié la composition des fonds ISR labellisés par Novethic en 2009. Le résultat est atterrant : parmi les 89 fonds analysés, pas moins de 71 fonds contiennent dans leurs portefeuilles d'actifs au moins une des 15 entreprises controversées sélectionnées par les Amis de la Terre pour leurs pratiques sociales et environnementales désastreuses : Total, BP, Areva, France Télécom, BNP Paribas, AXA, etc. Soisic Rivoalan, rédactrice du rapport, explique : « Avec l'""Investissement socialement responsable"", banques et assurances entrent dans la valse du ""développement durable"". Malheureusement, elles n'ont pas changé leurs pratiques réelles et se sont limitées à promouvoir un affichage qui n'a pas de sens. Elles vendent à leurs clients des fonds soi-disant socialement responsables mais il s'avère qu'ils ne le sont pas. Détenir des actions de Total, Shell, Areva ou de BNP Paribas est-il socialement responsable ? Pour les Amis de la Terre, la réponse est clairement « non ». L'appellation « ISR » est donc totalement illégitime pour une immense majorité des produits d'épargne ainsi nommés par les banques et les assurances elles-mêmes ».
Deux éléments majeurs expliquent la présence d'entreprises controversées dans les fonds ""socialement responsables"" : les fonds sont investis presque systématiquement dans des entreprises multinationales, par nature plus promptes à avoir des pratiques contestables. Par ailleurs, la notation extra-financière, telle que pratiquée par Vigeo (agence de notation extra-financière), est défaillante : juste avant l'explosion de Deepwater Horizon, la plate-forme pétrolière exploitée par BP, certains reportings extra-financiers n'hésitaient pas à noter au sein du groupe « une volonté de réduire son impact environnemental » et l'existence « d'une démarche active en gestion de la sécurité ». (3)
Face à cet état de fait, les citoyens épargnants peuvent se trouver désemparés. Afin de les guider dans le choix de leur épargne, les Amis de la Terre publient, parallèlement au rapport, le guide éco-citoyen ""Environnement : comment choisir mon épargne ?"" (1). « Ce nouveau guide classe les produits d'épargne, du livret A à l'assurance-vie en passant par le livret développement durable, selon leurs impacts et leurs risques sociaux et environnementaux. Pour des informations plus détaillées, il est possible pour les épargnants de consulter le site internet www.financeresponsable.org. Les citoyens ne savent pas comment est employé l'argent qu'ils confient à leur banque ou à leur assurance mais une chose est certaine, cet argent ne dort pas et est même réemployé à des fins que les épargnants ignorent. Il est temps de prendre conscience que nos choix peuvent transformer la société. Plutôt que d'investir en bourse, les Amis de la Terre conseillent aux épargnants les investissements solidaires, aux garanties sociales et environnementales nettement supérieures à celles de l'ISR. » conclut Yann Louvel, en charge de la campagne sur la responsabilité des acteurs financiers privés aux Amis de la Terre.

Kenya ",Chinese loan underwrites Gibe 3 dam destruction,Industrial and Commercial Bank of  (ICBC) ,China,Gibe III dam ,energy plants - dams,Ethiopia,"
NGOs are outraged after
confirmation that the world's largest bank will finance the destructive Gibe 3
hydropower dam. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) is
underwriting a $500 million contract awarded May 13 to Dongfang Electric
Corporation for the dam's turbines and electro-mechanical works. Although ICBC
has not publicly announced the loan, an official confirmed September 8 by email
that the financial agreement between ICBC and the Ethiopian government was
signed in July. The funding undermines ICBC's efforts to build a global
reputation as a socially and environmentally responsible lending institution.   Ethiopia's Omo River is a lifeline to Lake Turkana in northern Kenya. The 1,870
MW Gibe 3 Dam would shrink the Omo River's flow into Lake Turkana, devastating
the lake and some 300,000 indigenous people who depend on it. Severe
degradation of Lake Turkana would intensify tribal conflicts and could
destabilize the already volatile area between the Ethiopian, Kenyan, and
Sudanese borders.   Ikal Angelei, Chair of Friends of Lake Turkana, said: ""ICBC is underwriting the destruction of our peoples. Their funding is
a hideous gesture of the destruction Chinese funds can bring to Africa's
poorest communities.""   Friends of Lake Turkana has filed a lawsuit in Kenyan court over the
government's failure to protect Lake Turkana communities from the dam. Since
2009, Lake Turkana communities have voiced their opposition to the Gibe 3 Dam
through demonstrations, petitions and meetings with government officials. A
public demonstration against ICBC's loan is planned in Nairobi for September
28.  Terri Hathaway, Director of International Rivers' Africa Program, said: ""Development banks and other private banks
have turned away from Gibe 3 Dam. Even Italy's export credit agency refused to
support the Italian contractor. It is disturbing that ICBC will fund a project
which breaks Ethiopian law and has been shunned by the international
community.""   The Gibe 3 Dam is Ethiopia's largest public infrastructure project to date. The
dam's contract was awarded in 2006 to Italian construction giant, Salini
Costruttori, without international competitive bidding. Construction began the
same year in violation of Ethiopian law and without securing external funding.
Four years of aggressive efforts by the Ethiopian government and Salini had
failed to attract external funding. In July, the African Development Bank and
the European Investment Bank withdrew their funding consideration for the Gibe
3 Dam. In 2008, JPMorgan Chase and SACE, the Italian export credit agency, both
refused to finance the dam.  Sonja Willems, Campaign Coordinator of BankTrack said, ""This loan makes a mockery of ICBC's actions to establish itself as a
socially and environmentally responsible lender. As the world's largest bank,
ICBC should strive to become an environmental leader, but instead is building a
reputation of undercutting other banks' standards and financing untouchable
projects.""   Gibe 3
Dam Background The Gibe 3 Dam Environmental Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) was
finalized in January 2009, more than two years after the dam contract was
awarded and construction began. The government of Ethiopia broke its own law in
2006 when it awarded the contract without the approval of the ESIA by the
country's Environmental Protection Authority. The ESIA has been criticized for
its poor analysis and significant gaps in its scope, namely the dam's impact to
Lake Turkana.
Due to concerns over the dam's
impact to Lake Turkana, in 2009 the African Development Bank commissioned an
independent study by Dr. Sean Avery.  The study confirmed that the Gibe 3
Dam would reduce flows and threaten the lake's most productive fishing area. It
also noted that large-scale irrigation could cut the river's flow by an
additional 30%, an impact neglected in the ESIA.  A 2009 independent report by the African Resources Working Group warned that the Gibe 3 Dam
could lead to a 12 meter drop in Lake Turkana's water level.  Reduced flow
would largely be caused by abstraction for large irrigation and seepage losses
from the reservoir. Neither impact has been sufficiently studied.   Project developers have ignored the dam's potential to intensify existing
tribal conflicts. A 2009 USAID report recommended that a project conflict
vulnerability assessment for the downstream indigenous ethnic groups should be
conducted.

Tasmania ",Environment groups welcome Gunns’ frank assessment on native forests,ANZ ,Australia,,,,"
The Wilderness Society, the Australian Conservation
Foundation and Environment Tasmania welcomed the long awaited
announcement by the Chief Executive of Gunns to move out of native
forest logging and work with the community and conservation groups
to ""find joint solutions to age-old conflicts and move beyond 
a real, sustainable forest industry"". 
These comments forecast a change in direction to the long running
conflict over forestry in Tasmania.
The Wilderness Society spokesperson Paul Oosting said
""Community and environment groups working for decades for the
protection of Tasmania's irreplaceable native forests see Gunns
announcement as a very welcome breakthrough. We look forward to
protecting Tasmania's forests and supporting new lasting jobs by
continuing to work with the timber industry topave a way forward.""
Environment Tasmania, The Wilderness Society and the
Australian Conservation Foundation are engaged in talks with
forestry industry representatives on options for the protection of
native forests, the creation of a sustainable timber industry and
the delivery of an end to the decades-long forest conflict.
 If groups can reach an agreement over
principles, then they would seek government support for a broad
process to involve stakeholders and the broader community in the
development and delivery of a solution. 
 
Environment Tasmania Director Dr Phill Pullinger also
welcomed Gunns'
shift. ""We now have the best opportunity in decades to
resolve the forest conflict in Tasmania.  It is vitally important for Tasmania's
future that we protect our native forests, create a timber industry
that Tasmanians can be proud of, and heal the deep divisions in our
community.  We have to find a solution
to the conflict over forestry that is durable, lasting and involves
the whole Tasmanian community,"" he said.
""If Gunns moves out of native forest logging and
concentrates on processing its plantations, it will protect jobs in
the timber industry,"" said Lindsay Hesketh, National Forest
Campaigner for the Australian Conservation Foundation.
""It's time to look at forests in Tasmania
in a new way because the old way - a battle between jobs and
forests - has protected neither. It ruptured the community,
failed to protect jobs and destroyed Tasmanian's natural
heritage.
""We encourage all players to continue dialogue
to find common ground on these important issues,"" Mr Hesketh
said. "

Equador ",Ecuador’s most spectacular waterfall threatened by  Chinese-funded hydroelectric project,Export-Import Bank of  ,China,,,,"
A massive new Chinese-funded hydroelectric
project now threatens Ecuador's
San Rafael Falls, one of the truly great waterfalls
of the world.
In early June, the Export-Import Bank of China, after a long and rocky negotiation
period, succeeded in signing a $1.68 billion loan to Ecuador for the construction of the
1,500 MW Coca-Codo Sinclair Hydroelectric Project. Last week, the Chinese
contractor Sinohydro officially started work on the project that is scheduled
to be completed in the year 2016.
However, specialists are warning that due
to inadequate planning and an inflated design, the project will be an
ecological disaster and won´t deliver its promised energy production.
The water diversion dam for the project is
designated to be built just 19 km upstream of San Rafael Falls on the Coca
River and will effectively divert the water needed for energy production
through a large cross-country tunnel spanning the distance across a prominent
bend in the river, thereby circumventing the falls altogether and leaving San
Rafael Falls high and dry.
At a towering 480 ft, San
 Rafael Falls is Ecuador's
largest and most spectacular waterfall. It is located in the mega-diverse transition
zone between the Andes
 Mountains and the Amazon
and is a principal attraction of the UNESCO Sumaco Biosphere Reserve. The falls
have become one of the more prominent images and icons for promoting ecotourism
in Ecuador,
a country that made headlines in 2008 for being the first nation to grant
constitutional rights to nature itself.
""So basically you have the first country in
the world that legally respects nature, and they are about to destroy their
greatest waterfall,"" said Dr. Matt Finer of the DC-based Save America's
Forests. ""While we applaud and support Ecuador's revolutionary initiative
to leave oil reserves under the Amazon, this hydroelectric project is just a
step back to business as usual.""
Ecuador made international headlines recently by signing a trust fund
agreement with the United Nations as part of a bold plan to receive
compensation for not extracting nearly a billion barrels of oil lying beneath Yasuni National
  Park, one of the most biodiverse rainforests on
Earth.
According to Matthew Terry of the Napo
River Foundation, based in Tena,
 Ecuador, the
principal problem is that the project is completely over-dimensioned in
relation to the amount of available flow in the river, and lacks a comprehensive
environmental impact study, as well as a number of technical studies, final
designs, and a definitive budget.
The state-owned Hydro Coca Codo Sinclair
company boasts that the project will generate 1,500 MW of electricity using 222
cubic meters of water per second from the Coca River.
But Terry maintains that the river typically maintains a flow of only 80-100
cubic meters per second, and the project does not have a reservoir with any
significant regulating capacity due to the issues of sedimentation and seismic
risk.
""There is no doubt in my mind
that when they build the diversion structure with the capacity to take over 200
cubic meters per second from the river channel, and the river only has about
half of that, they will take the entire river and leave the San Rafael Falls
with virtually no water,"" said Terry.
And one doesn't have to look far for an
example. Ecuador's second
largest waterfall, Agoyan
 Falls, has been almost completely de-watered by a similar hydroelectric
project scheme.
""We
maintain that the first priority for developing the Coca-Codo
Sinclair project is to determine the amount of
available water at the dam site,"" said Terry. ""And this analysis must take into
account all instream environmental flow considerations, as well as future
demands for water in the basin.""
The Coca-Codo Sinclair Hydroelectric
Project began development in the mid-1980s, but was eventually scrapped after
the Reventador volcano erupted and devastated the entire region in 1987, and
the project was considered to be high risk. In 2007, President Correa
resurrected the project as one of the centerpieces of his administration's energy
plan, and cites recurrent energy shortages in the capital Quito as evidence that this project must move
forward.
It is touted to be the largest energy
project in Ecuador
and the largest overseas hydropower project undertaken by a Chinese company
(Sinohydro). Only two Chinese firms responded to the international bidding, and
only Sinohydro met the bidding requirements.
According to Finer and Terry, the two new
feasibility studies that recommend developing the 1,500 MW project were based
on historic hydrologic data of questionable validity, neglected to include
hydrologic data over the last 20 years, and failed to take into account the
effects of multiple trans-continental water diversions from the Coca watershed,
all of which justify their concern that the project does not take into account the
current available flow regime in the Coca River drainage and Upper Napo basin.
The original feasibility studies, financed
by the IDB and finished in 1992, recommended the project to be built in two
phases - first, a 432 MW project using a flow of 63.5 cubic meters of water per
second from the Coca River, and later, in order to take advantage of
exceptional high flows for power generation, a second stage could be installed
with capacity of 427 MW, for a total production of 859 MW using a total flow of
127 cubic meters of water per second.
In 2007, after President Correa resurrected
the project, the Italian firm Electroconsult was contracted to provide a new
feasibility study that justified nearly doubling the installed capacity of the
project to 1,500 MW. However, according to Terry, the study utilized historic
hydrologic data of very questionable validity and quality, and no effort was
made to verify the persistence of flows in the project area.
In January 2010, the Mexican state
electricity company completed an analysis of the Electroconsult study, and
recommended an installed capacity of 1,200 MW for the project. However, this
analysis only evaluated the methodology used in the Electroconsult study, and
did not verify or evaluate the hydrologic data for the project,
""Coca-Codo Sinclair will only be able to
produce its installed capacity of 1,500 MW when the Coca River
is in high flood stage,"" stated Terry. ""In fact, if promises are kept to
maintain an adequate aesthetic flow for San Rafael Falls,
the project will only be able to produce between 200 MW to 400 MW of
electricity the vast majority of the time.""
The Coca-Codo Sinclair Hydroelectric
Project also threatens one of the last intact roadless areas in the Tropical
Andes. The great bend or ""codo"" in the Coca
River, is not only home to San Rafael Falls, but also forms a natural barrier
with its steep canyon walls that protects a vast rainforest wilderness area.
Due to its importance for the conservation of tropical biodiversity, UNESCO
designated the area as a Biosphere Reserve, and even the oil companies spared
this area during prospection and development of pipeline corridors in the
Ecuadorian Amazon.
A new access road has already been
constructed into a previously untouched part of the UNESCO Sumaco Biosphere
Reserve to the proposed powerhouse location. Meanwhile, a second major road into
the reserve is now being planned for additional project components. The studies
for the proposed 500-kV transmission line corridor have yet to be completed,
and it is expected that it will require another separate road corridor as well,
in addition to shorter access roads for the construction of the tunnel and work
camps.
""It is now well understood by scientists
that new road construction is the biggest trigger of tropical deforestation, so
building multiple new roads into the core protected areas of the Sumaco
Biosphere Reserve without adequate planning and studies is incredibly
irresponsible,"" said Finer. 
With the project officially underway with
Sinohydro, Terry claims that the poorly-planned project is high cost, high
risk, and a serious distraction from the country's renewable energy development
priorities, and that Coca-Codo will ultimately saddle Ecuador with huge debts
and unforeseen commitments to China when it is not able to produce the amount
of energy being touted by its promoters to pay back the 15-year loan that
carries a steep 6.9 percent interest rate.
He suggests implementing an aggressive
energy efficiency plan for the country as an immediate measure to reduce or
offset the demand for electricity during critical periods and long-term growth.  Terry also indicates that there are no
shortage of superior alternatives for renewable power generation available to
President Correa and Ecuador.
For example, the Sopladora and Cardenillo Hydrolectric Projects would tie into
existing power transmission infrastructure, are closer to the biggest
population centers in the country, would cause much less environmental impact,
and would generate over 600 MW. In addition, the Chachimbiro, Tufiño and
Chalupas geothermal projects would add over 400 MW. These geothermal projects
are the best options for secure and renewable energy available to Ecuador,
according to Terry, and should be national priorities. "

International ",How an Arctic oil rush will help suffocate the planet,,,,,,"
Can  you believe the Esperanza has been in the Arctic for a week now?
 When  we arrived the sea was a mill pond and the sky clear and 
spectacularwith  sunsets that go on for hours, as if they'd never end. 
What a difference  a week makes. Last night the seas tossed us around in
 our bunks,  throwing all it could find to the floor, thwacking 
everything in  cupboards against their sides, like an angry poltergeist.
 Even the sink  was making a sound like a person drowning, emitting a 
foul stink,  whilstthe toilet cisterns overfilled every time the ship 
lurched  starboard. The hardier of us slept four hours at most. At least
 I now  have personalexperience of those dangerously temperamental 
Arctic  weather patterns Ikeep talking about in the media.
Since we  arrived we've had good news and bad news. The good news is 
that BP has  been ruled out by Greenland to receive licenses for this 
area. According  to the Guardian, that's partly thanks to the Espy's 
presence here,  which would make it 'political madness' to allow BP to 
bid.  Reading  this news to the crew was one of my highlights since 
arriving onboard,  as this confirmed to the crew that what feels like 
sitting on a ship in  the middle of an ocean doing little more than 
waving at warships is  actually meaningful and having direct effect. It 
definitely helps temper  the cabin fever.
The bad news is that Cairn has found gas under  the Stena Forth drill
 ship, which they are trying to spin as being a  good sign of 
findingoil. Hearing this news made us all feel impotent,  but the upside
 is that at least they haven't actually found oil yet.   Besides, the 
next day Cairn's shares dropped considerably so it strikes  me that 
those in the city who know this sort of thing are not at all  convinced 
by Cairn'spropaganda.
If you've seen the news this  week, you'll have seen that the debate 
on Arctic oil exploration has  been reignited, which we can chalk up as 
acampaign success. But still,  and perhaps unsurprisingly, the media is 
often focused on Greenland's  right to exploit its resources, rather 
thanconveying the bigger picture  about oil and our future. Of course we
 aresympathetic to the needs of  all governments to provide a stable 
income for its country and security  for its people. But sitting on the 
bridge of this ship, which we have  positioned exactly between the rig 
and the drill ship, its clear to me  that new oil development delivers 
neither of those things.
I look  from one to the other and imagine several hundred more, 
identical rigs,   popping up all over the ocean, right up to the 
horizon.I think of all  the oil being sucked up through the holes that 
companieslike Cairn have  punched in the roof of the world. And I think 
about allof that oil  chugging back to land on tankers and from tankers 
to refineries, where  it joins the oil from the deep wells of Angola, 
from the tar sands of  Canada, from the bloodied wells of Nigeria that 
have been justification  for murder and massacre, from refineries to 
petrol tanks and from car  exhausts into the atmosphere. I think of the 
emissions knitting  themselves around our earth, over the roof of the 
world, down its sides,  underneath, with no holes for a head or an arm, 
like some kind of  hideous Christmas present from a relative that hates 
us and wants us to  die. 
We are suffocating our planet with its own innards. This  inevitably 
means both economic and physical instability for all  countries. In 
theend, this means the end of the world. In the meantime  it means pain 
andsuffering for all those who are having weirder weather  than they've 
ever had before, from the floods of Pakistan, to the forest  fires of 
Russia. Yes we are sitting in the Arctic fighting the  development of 
newoil here. But this is a proxy war for the whole  planet, a proxy war 
forthe future. 
Don't think we don't know  that our three word answers to 
journalist's questions on 'the  alternatives' to oil sound simplistic, 
sometimes naive, sometimes trite.  We are getting three seconds spaces 
todeliver a symposium of solutions.  And frankly we don't have them all!
 But we do need to have the  conversation. And that's why we're here, to
 get people talking about the  global oil problem, not just here in the 
Arctic.
We're not just  saying 'go beyond oil' because it fits on a banner. 
We're urging world  governments to get their heads out of their oil 
wells and recognise that  whoever's oil we are burning we need to start 
stopping now, because in  the end we are all stuck under the one 
sweater, and its getting really  tight. "

Ethiopia ",Gibe 3: African Development Bank and European Investment Bank out. Who's in?,Industrial and Commercial Bank of  (ICBC) ,China,Gibe III dam ,energy plants - dams,Ethiopia,"
Ethiopia's Gibe 3 Dam remains the most destructive dam being built today. According to the official project website, Ethiopia plans to pay $572 million (448m Euros) from their own pockets. But the rest of the dam's $2 billion (1.55b Euros) price tag remains unfunded. Which banks are being chased to fund this highly destructive dam? Here’s the rundown:
Development Banks Out
Earlier this month, the African Development Bank officially withdrew its funding consideration, as did the European Investment Bank in July. Both AfDB and EIB had been considering loans for a sub-contract to finance the dam’s turbines and electro-mechanical works. Why a sub-contract? Because the project’s lucrative, no-bid contract with Italian construction giant, Salini, violates international procurement standards.
The World Bank has told NGOs that, at this time, they are not considering any support for Gibe 3 Dam. Discussions are indefinitely halted after a high-ranking Ethiopian official allegedly told the Bank it could “go to hell” over its indigenous peoples safeguard policy. The World Bank previously said that Gibe 3’s no-bid contract to Salini 
violates the Bank’s procurement policy, so there’s no chance of a project loan, but the Bank could still give project guarantees. If tempers calm down, could the Bank jump back in, undermining its development goals and policies?
China and Italy In?
In May, the Ethiopian government gave the sub-contract to Chinese company, Dongfang Electric Corporation, and is looking to China’s largest bank, ICBC, for roughly $425 million (85%) of the $500 million sub-contract. Kenya’s Friends of Lake Turkana, BankTrack and International Rivers immediately called on ICBC to stay out of the project. “Funding the Gibe 3 Project would seriously damage ICBC’s reputation as a diligent, environmentally responsible bank.” No official word yet whether ICBC has approved the loan, but many eyes are watching this test case for China’s role in Africa. We remain hopeful that ICBC will follow JP MorganChase, which in 2008, reportedly considered, but did not approve, a similar size loan.
In July 2009, Ethiopia awarded a sub-contract to Chinese company TBEA, for the transmission line between the dam and the Wolaita substation. Roughly $29 million (85%) of the $34 million contract was expected to be financed by China Exim Bank, although there is no confirmation that funding has since been approved.
The Government of Italy is still undecided on a project loan of 250 million Euros (roughly $318m). In June, Italian NGOs demonstrated against Italian involvement in the destructive project. Maybe the government should follow the lead of its export credit agency, SACE, 
which in 2008, refused a request by the no-bid contractor, Salini, to support the project.
Ethiopia can develop its power sector and meet its development goals without Gibe 3
ICBC, Italy and World Bank should focus their investments away from Gibe 3 to power development projects in Ethiopia that won't cause widespread harm. But, even if these loans are approved, there’s still a gap of at least $600 million, not to mention cost overruns. What other banks is the Ethiopian government going to chase? "

",U.S. Agency votes to finance giant coal plant in India,,,Sasan ultra mega coal power project (UMPP) ,energy plants - coal,India,"
United States Export-Import Bank Votes for final commitment on Sasan coal fired power project Civil society condemns taxpayer money used to fund corporate welfare and fossil fuels   
	Washington, D.C. -
  After bowing to political pressure to reverse its rejection of the 
3,960 MW Sasan coal-fired Ultra Mega Power and Mine Project, the United 
States Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank) voted on Wednesday to provide a 
""final commitment"" and send the project to Congress for final review. 
The move marks the last step before final approval of U.S. subsidies for
 one of the world's largest point sources of carbon dioxide emissions, 
and yet another strategic misstep for the global climate and the clean 
technology export sector in the United States.
	 
	Sasan is one of 
nine ""Ultra Mega Power Plants"" (UMPP) being pursued by the Indian 
government.  Each UMPP is roughly the equivalent of eight average U.S. 
coal fired power plants.  Sasan alone will be responsible for 26 to 27 
million tons of carbon dioxide annually - one fifth of all proposed coal
 fired power plants in the United States combined. With India averaging 
some of the highest transmission losses in the world of 25-40%, as well 
as facing an increasing need for imported coal, which leads to price 
instability for end users, many question the ability of these plants to 
deliver India's much needed boost in energy supplies.
	 
	Civil society 
groups have condemned Ex-Im Bank's reversal on Sasan. ""The fix is in at 
Ex-Im Bank. The Bank's board bowed to political pressure and in so doing
 wastes public financing to worsen their fossil fuel binge"" said Doug 
Norlen Policy Director for Pacific Environment.
	 
	Like many large 
scale projects Sasan requires government backed financing to reduce the 
risk the private market refuses to take on.  ""The US government already 
lavishly subsidizes the coal industry with some $19 billion in tax 
breaks and other handouts,"" said Michelle Chan, Economic Policy Director
 for Friends of the Earth, which recently issued a subsidies report.
 ""With this vote, Ex-Im Bank is choosing to dole out hundreds of 
millions more to dirty coal."" The U.S. company set to profit from the 
deal, Bucyrus, took home hefty profits last year with $2.6 billion in 
revenue; and despite its jobs rhetoric, the company's 10-K states that 
it ""recently finalized a joint venture with a local partner to expand 
our manufacturing capacity in China.""
	 
	However, the 
support of Sasan is not an isolated incident. According to a recently 
released Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, more than 95% of
 Ex-Im's energy portfolio is based on fossil fuels, and in 2009 Ex-Im 
Bank financing for renewable energy was less than 0.5% of the agency's 
total financing. Yet, according to a recent study by the World Wildlife 
Fund, for every million dollars invested in energy projects, 13.5 jobs 
are created in the clean tech export sector, while only 3.7 and 4.9 jobs
 are created in the oil, gas and coal industries, respectively.
	 
	""Addressing 
climate change by developing and exporting tomorrow's clean energy 
technologies strengthens the US economy. Continuing to finance outdated 
technologies that destroy our environment also destroys our chances for 
clean energy job creation. It only serves to cripple our competitiveness
 in the long run"" said John Coequyt - Director of International Programs
 at the Sierra Club.
	 
	The agency is now
 turning its sights on an even larger and more destructive project, the 
Kusile coal fired power project in South Africa. The 4,800 MW project 
would be responsible for 36.8 million tons of carbon dioxide annually 
and would increase South African energy sector emissions by 12.8% and 
the country's total contribution to climate change by 9.7%.
	 
	UScitizens have 
already submitted nearly 7,500 public comments in opposition to the US 
government's contribution to this dirty project and its environmental 
impacts.  The US Ex-Im Bank Board is expected to take up a due diligence
 vote on Kusile in early September.  With the agency's reversal on 
Sasan, and the sheer scale of the Kusile project in the pipeline, it is 
likely to be a pitched battle.
	 
	""These public 
financing decisions will literally determine our future. We can either 
help lead the world in a clean energy economy, or deepen the climate 
change crisis we are already in,"" said Norlen. "

Altamira, Brazil ",Historic indigenous summit calls for halting Brazil's Belo Monte dam,,,Belo Monte dam ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"
Hundreds of indigenous leaders from throughout the Brazilian Amazon Basin joined local riverbank dwellers and dam-affected people this week for the historic Terra Livre Regional Encampment. Bearing the message ""Defend the Xingu: Stop Belo Monte,"" participants occupied the riverside port of Altamira, Pará to discuss threats posed by major infrastructure projects in the Amazon, in particular the controversial Belo Monte Dam on the Xingu River.
Organized by the Coordinating Body of Indigenous Organizations of the Brazilian Amazon - COIAB, and backed by a coalition of Brazilian and international organizations, the Encampment represents a seminal meeting for indigenous resistance to Belo Monte Dam. Hundreds of indigenous leaders from 27 ethnic groups in the Brazilian Amazon converged, joined by local communities, NGOs and leading academics. Participants discussed the harmful impacts of large infrastructure projects on the Amazon's ecologically and culturally sensitive rainforests and the response by indigenous and social movements in the face of such threats.
Choosing to hold the summit in Altamira, a city that would be partially flooded by the planned dam, positions the Belo Monte project and the Brazilian government's Accelerated Growth Program (PAC) as top priorities in the battle for indigenous rights and for a more ecologically sound development path.
Among the indigenous participants at the encampment is the renowned Chief Raoni Metuktire of the Kayapo people, a highly respected leader who has been instrumental in efforts to protect the Xingu River basin for over 30 years. ""We must never give up, because we are fighting for a right that is ours!"" said Raoni in an address to a gathering of over 500 people. ""Nature is life, it has sustained us until today, so we have to defend Nature as our father and mother who give us life….Is this  what we really want, my friends? Let us stand together against Belo Monte!""
Speakers at the gathering presented the myriad problems posed by the planned mega-dam, including catastrophic environmental impacts to the Xingu River Basin and the violation of the rights of local populations. In addition, the project's technical viability has come into question. According to Antonia Melo, a leader and spokesperson for the Xingu Alive Forever Movement, ""There are huge design flaws being uncovered in Belo Monte Dam's construction plans, raising further doubts about its economic viability and socio-environmental impacts. For example, engineers are now discovering the absence of sufficient bedrock foundation to support the construction of the main Pimental dam.""
The Terra Livre encampment comes at a time of heightening police crackdown on peaceful protests in Altamira, after President Lula's June visit to inaugurate the Belo Monte dam ignited protests given that eight civil action lawsuits against the dam were still pending. Yet despite government intimidation, the encampment has forged on. ""This is a critical moment for indigenous peoples from the Amazon Basin to affirm their opposition to Belo Monte, and other projects of its kind that represent an attack on their rights and the destruction of their lands. It is also crucial that we work together with our non-indigenous partners to confront this problem,"" stated Marcos Apurinã, General Coordinator of COIAB.
The four-day meeting featured presentations by indigenous and grassroots leaders, experts, as well as human rights and environmental lawyers. At a press conference today at 14:00 in the São Sebastião room in the Altamira Cathedral, participants will present a declaration voicing their unified opposition to the Belo Monte dam and call for global solidarity in fighting this mega-dam as well as other similar projects in the Amazon. The event will be followed by a public rally in Altamira that will depart from the Altamira Cathedral at 15:30.
The declaration from this gathering will be brought to the National Terra Livre Encampment being held at Campo Grande, in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, from August 16-20, 2010. "

San Fransisco ",The Gibe 3 dam – a test case for China’s role in Africa,Industrial and Commercial Bank of  (ICBC) ,China,Gibe III dam ,energy plants - dams,Ethiopia,"
The Gibe 3 Dam in Ethiopia is Africa’s most destructive dam project. So far, the Ethiopian government has not managed to attract any international finance for it. After several other funders pulled out, China’s biggest bank is expected to decide about a loan for Gibe 3 soon. The decision is an important test case for the environmental responsibility of China’s overseas lenders.
The Gibe 3 Dam is currently under construction on Ethiopia’s Omo River. As we have documented in eyewitness reports, articles and commentaries, the dam could lead to the collapse of the fragile ecosystems of the Lower Omo Valley and Lake Turkana. No less than 500,000 poor indigenous people depend on these ecosystems for their survival. The dam endangers two World Heritage Sites.
The concerns of affected people and NGOs have meanwhile been confirmed by official studies. A review of the project’s impacts on Lake Turkana commissioned by the African Development Bank states: “Lake Turkana is dependant on the Omo River for almost 90% of its inflow. The river is the lake’s umbilical cord. If the Omo River inflow is cut, the lake level will fall. (…) The filling of the dam has the potential to dry up Ferguson’s Gulf, the most productive fishing area of the lake.” The Ethiopian government has expressed an interest in using the Gibe 3 Project for irrigation. If this happens, the study finds, the world’s largest desert lake “could drop 40 metres, and could ultimately be reduced to two small puddles.”
Ethiopia will not be able to build the $1.7 billion dam project without international support. Yet in spite of strenuous efforts over the last four years, the government has not managed to secure any foreign funding. The institutions which have evaluated Gibe 3 include the World Bank, the African Development Bank, the European Investment Bank, Italy’s export credit agency SACE, and US bank JP Morgan Chase. For one reason or the other, none of them have become involved. Funders don’t usually inform the public if they decide not to finance a project, but it is clear that the Gibe 3 Dam would violate environmental standards which many of them have endorsed.
In May, Ethiopia’s government announced that the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) would fund a Chinese equipment contract for Gibe 3 with a loan of approximately $450 million. ICBC is China’s and the world’s biggest commercial bank. Kenya’s Friends of Lake Turkana, BankTrack and International Rivers immediately called on ICBC to stay out of the project. “Funding the Gibe 3 Project would seriously damage ICBC’s reputation as a diligent, environmentally responsible bank,” the three organizations warned in a letter to the bank’s CEO.
ICBC has meanwhile clarified that it has not yet taken a decision on the Gibe 3 loan. Wei Guoxiong, the bank’s Chief Risk Officer, assured a Chinese business newspaper that ICBC was evaluating the project “very carefully, very carefully”. “Although ICBC is a commercial bank, we are not a mercenary,” Wei Guoxiong said. “We will not support , whether domestically or abroad.” ICBC has expressed a strong commitment to China’s Green Credit Policy and has won numerous banking awards, including a prize for the country’s Best Corporate Citizen. Gibe 3 will put those commitments to the test.
ICBC has a 20 percent stake in South Africa’s Standard Bank. Standard Bank is advising ICBC on African projects such as Gibe 3. The South African bank has signed the Equator Principles, an environmental standard for the international banking sector. The Gibe 3 Dam would violate the banking standards on social and environmental assessment, indigenous peoples, and biodiversity conservation. While ICBC has not signed the Equator Principles, its Chief Risk Officer argues that its policies are “in some cases more stringent” than these standards.
Chinese investment in African infrastructure is much needed. We have often pointed out problems with specific projects and the environmental standards of Chinese funders. We have also acknowledged the environmental progress that has happened in recent years. With this 
background, the Gibe 3 Dam is a test case for China’s future role in Africa. Hardly any other project has been so extensively documented, discussed by international financiers and civil society, and covered in the media.
If ICBC declines to fund Gibe 3, China’s biggest bank will demonstrate that it respects international environmental standards in its funding decisions, and that it can become a leading actor in the global banking sector. If ICBC does provide funding for the project, it will put hundreds of thousands of poor people at risk, undermine international 
environmental standards, and taint its own reputation. "

London ",Global Witness applauds RBS penalty over terrorist financing,Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS)  ,United Kingdom,,,,"
Global
Witness welcomes the decisive action taken by the UK financial regulator,
the FSA, which has fined the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) £5.6 million for
failing to check whether its customers were on the UK terrorist sanctions list.
RBS' inability to properly vet its customers highlights concerns about the sort
of customers banks are willing to accept. 
Global
Witness has repeatedly warned that banks are not doing enough to tackle the
flow of dirty money, whether terrorist financing, tax evasion or the proceeds
of corruption. Our reports have exposed how major banks including Barclays, Citibank,
and Bank of America have helped to fuel corruption in developing countries by
doing business with corrupt politicians.
""We're
pleased that the FSA has finally found its teeth and moved to punish RBS. We
hope that from now on the regulator will come down heavily on any bank that
fails to take the fight against money laundering seriously enough,"" said Robert Palmer, a campaigner with Global Witness.
This is the
biggest penalty meted out by the FSA for financial crime failings and the first
under the UK's
2007 anti-money laundering regulations. But Global Witness doesn't think it is
enough to deter irresponsible behaviour.
""£5.6
million is small change for RBS and it pales in comparison with fines levied
elsewhere. For example, Lloyds bank was fined $350 million (£220 million) by
the US authorities for
breaching American sanctions in relation to Iran,"" said Palmer.
In its
Decision Notice, the FSA criticised RBS for not keeping consistent records of
the beneficial owner of its corporate customers (i.e. the person who actually
controls and financially benefits from a company). Criminals, terrorists and
corrupt politicians can hide their identities and therefore their assets behind
corporate ownership secrecy.
Without
knowing who actually controls a company it can be impossible for a bank to know
who they are dealing with, and to know whether their customer is actually a
terrorist or a corrupt politician.

London ",New report argues RBS should be turned into Green Investment Bank,Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS)  ,United Kingdom,,,,"
New research released today finds that transforming the Royal Bank of Scotland into the Green Investment Bank would kick start the green energy revolution.  The research, by former Pricewaterhouse Coopers consultant, James Leaton, finds that it would bring 50, 000 new green jobs a year, increase efficiency, reduce the UK's carbon emissions and improve international competitiveness - whilst not increasing the budget deficit.
It has recently been reported that amidst confusion and wrangling between George Osbourne and Vince Cable, the government may scrap plans to invest public money in a Green Investment Bank. Instead the government may rely on private capital to fund green projects such as wind farms, high-speed rail and electric cars.
The report was commissioned by pressure group PLATFORM and the anti-poverty organisation World Development Movement, who have been campaigning for RBS to end its investment in high carbon projects. They reject the premise that investment in a green economy should be scrapped due to public sector cuts.
Deborah Doane, director of the World Development Movement, argues “It would be completely irresponsible and short-sighted to scrap public investment in a low carbon economy. RBS is sitting on billions of pounds from the taxpayer which is going to finance dirty projects often linked to human rights abuses, instead of more productive ends. The money we’ve invested in RBS should be directed towards green investment. It’s a no-brainer: not only wouldn’t it cost the taxpayer directly, it would boost the economy and create new jobs in the UK at a much-needed time.”
The new report 'A Bank for the Future – Maximising public investment in a low carbon economy'  estimates that at least £200 billion needs to be invested in UK energy infrastructure over the next 10 – 15 years.
In the report, James Leaton argues: ""The government needs to bring together its banking reform and green agendas to set an example with RBS of how expertise in project finance, renewables and Small to Medium size Enterprises can contribute green jobs and infrastructure for the UK and beyond.""
The idea has received backing within parliament; one hundred and seven MPs signed EDM 880  which “calls on the Government to use its majority share in RBS to prioritise climate change as a principal concern in RBS's lending decisions”; meanwhile the Environmental Audit Committee earlier this year grilled RBS bank chiefs for funding pollution .  At the time Martin Horwood, MP for Cheltenham and Environmental Audit Committee member, described the sessions as, “One of the angriest select committees I can ever remember attending.”
Mel Evans, PLATFORM, argues “Any publicly resourced Green Investment Bank should necessarily redirect funds from fossil fuel projects to new renewables.  Not only would it be a complete contradiction in aims, but continued public support for fossil fuels, via RBS and more broadly in government, undermines the potential of green investment to tackle climate change.” "

Brasilia, Brazil ",Lack of private sector participation in Belo Monte Dam consortium signals investor concerns over financial risks,,,Belo Monte dam ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"
This week's announcement detailing the members of the consortium seeking to build the controversial Belo Monte Dam in the Brazilian Amazon reveals a striking lack of private sector participation. The 18-member Norte Energia consortium(1) is marked by the absence of key players in the country's dam-building industry. State-owned or state-controlled participation in the consortium totals 77.5 percent, dwarfing the role of private sector investors and reflecting concerns about the financial risks associated with the world's third-largest planned hydroelectric project.
The lack of private sector enthusiasm reflects a series of unanswered questions, including the dam's higher-than-projected construction costs and uncertain generating capacity, as well as doubts about costs stemming from mitigation of its massive social and environmental impacts.  
The federal government's willingness to use massive public subsidies and pension funds in a project of dubious economic viability has drawn sharp criticism in Brazil.  ""Taxpayers and workers with investments in pension funds have no idea of the huge risks associated with Belo Monte.  The workers of Petrobras, Caixa Economica Federal, and Banco do Brasil are spending their retirement money to subsidize what private investors are afraid to touch,"" said Raul do Vale, spokesperson from  the Instituto Socioambiental.
An influential report entitled ""Uncertainties in Amazon Hydropower Development: Risk Scenarios and Environmental Issues around the Belo Monte Dam"" released in May by the Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica in São Paulo and the Conservation Strategy Fund in California has fueled investor fears. The report found that there is only a 28 percent chance that the Belo Monte Dam would yield a positive rate of return over the first 50 years of its operation. The report's risk scenario analysis calculates a high likelihood of a loss for investors ranging between US$3 - 8 billion.
Questions over the inefficiency of Belo Monte, which will produce an average of only 39 percent of its 11,233 megawatt installed capacity due to seasonal fluctuations in the river's flow, indicate that the project's heavy financial risks could only be solved by building additional reservoirs upstream.  The risk scenario report concludes that ""construction of Belo Monte now will lead to an entirely foreseeable - some would say planned - crisis, which will exert enormous pressure for the construction of new dams upstream of Belo Monte to store water and enable the dams' capacity to be fully used.""  Critics have long maintained that Belo Monte is only the first of a series of planned dams on the Xingu.
 Given uncertainties over the project's economic viability, the Brazilian government has announced a series of generous perks to lure investors, including subsidized loans, tax breaks and public-guaranteed insurance.  The National Development Bank, BNDES, has committed to finance up to 80 percent of Belo Monte's US$17 billion price tag, with interest rates of a mere 4 percent, a generous grace period and 30 years for repayment in what will be the largest loan in the bank's history.  The bank has already issued subsidized credit totaling  US$8 billion (R$14 billion) and 50 percent tax breaks over 10 years to increase the private sector's involvement in Belo Monte's auction on April 20th and to entice European turbine suppliers Alstom, Andritz, and Voith-Siemens in signing with the consortium.  BNDES has repeatedly been charged with having weak social and environmental safeguards, a lack of transparency in lending decisions, and deficient public oversight mechanisms.
""Belo Monte and other mega-dams in the Amazon are not necessary.  Studies have shown that by investing in energy efficiency and alternative sources of energy, Brazil could avoid the need for huge dams in the Amazon and save billions in the process,"" said Brent Millikan, Amazon Program Director at International Rivers. ""This project is a government handout to large construction and energy companies, several of which are major funders of political campaigns, at the expense of the Brazilian taxpayer, indigenous people, riverbank dwellers, small farmers and the Xingu River's incredible biodiversity.""
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note (1) Norte Energia is dominated by the state-led electric utility Eletrobras, with a 49.98% stake divided among itself (15%) and regional subsidiaries Eletronorte (19.98%) and Chesf (15%).  Pension funds of government banks and other state-owned entities will hold an impressive 25% stake in the consortium, including the Petros fund of Petrobras employees (10%), the funds Funcef (2.5%) and Caixa FI Cevix (2.5%) pertaining to Caixa Econômica Federal employees, and finance from Bolzano Participações (10%), which draws on the Previ fund of Banco do Brasil employees, as well as investments from Spanish electric utility Iberdrola.   Such government-led participation, totaling 77.5%, dwarfs the role of private sector investors in the consortium, such as regional pig iron producer Sinobras (1%) and energy company Gaia Energia e Participações of Grupo Bertin (9%), the leading player in the Brazilian Amazon's beef industry.

London ",RBS targeted by protesters at international banking conference,Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS)  ,United Kingdom,Canadian tar sands ,oil and gas,Canada,"
 Activists
from the London Camp for Climate Action and the UK Tar Sands Network attended
the Annual International Bankers Conference  in London this morning to
protest the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) using tax payers' money to finance
destructive fossil fuel projects around the world.  As bankers, including Stephen Hester, Head of RBS arrived at the conference,
they were given ‘Never mind the bankers' newspapers,  while activists took
turns to swipe at papier mache piggy banks emblazoned with the RBS logo. The
protest was billed as a ‘warm up' event to the Camp for Climate Action in Edinburgh in August that
will be targeting the headquarters of RBS.   Lisa Newberry of the UK Tar Sands Network who was protesting at the event said: ""Oil companies in Canada
are destroying crucial ecosystems, indigenous communities and the climate through
the extraction of tar sands, and banks like RBS are providing them with the
cash to do it. Activists in the UK
and in Canada
are coming together to cut off this destructive financial flow.""  RBS, which is 83% owned by the UK public, has historically been the UK bank
most heavily involved in providing fossil fuel finance. Companies that have
been recently financed include ones carrying out coal extraction in the UK, and
expansion of the Albertan tar sands.   Terry Gardiner, from the London Camp for Climate Action  said ""Banks
have trashed the economy, and are in the process of trashing the climate. Communities
affected by climate change are saying no to this exploitative and dangerous
destruction of our planet and our future. Hundreds of us will be targetting RBS
in Edinburgh
this August, taking steps to stop destructive projects like these by taking on
the institutions that feed them.""
 Notes to editors:
 
 www.bba.org.uk/annualconference   The newspaper can be downloaded from http://climatecamp.org.uk/actions/edinburgh-2010/never-mind-the-bankers
 see http://climatecamp.org.uk/actions/edinburgh-2010   Tar sands: http://blog.platformlondon.org/rbstarsands Coal: In September 2009, RBS led a consortium of five banks in providing Hargreaves Services with a £115 million credit facility. This British coal mining, importing and haulage company owns the Maltby coal mine in South Yorkshire which supplies Drax power station, the single biggest carbon emitter in the UK
and the site of the first Camp for Climate Action in 2006.   From the Camp for Climate Action website: Why RBS?  RBS is the UK bank that has been the most heavily involved in financing fossil
fuels and corporate bad guys around the world. It took part in providing E.ON
with $70 billion at the time it was looking to bust out 17 new coal and gas
power plants across Europe, and underwritten
$8 billion in loans to ConocoPhillips in the last three years, who apart from
being active in the Peruvian Amazon are one of the biggest players in the Canadian
tar sands. In fact RBS is the UK bank the most heavily involved in providing
the most loans to oil companies that are extracting tar sands and in doing so
trashing the climate and destroying Indigenous Communities.  Since the financial crisis, RBS has received billions of pounds of public money
to keep it afloat, to the point where it is now 84% owned by the UK public. Communities
in the UK
are now facing years of cuts to health, education and social services as a
result of bailing out the actions of irresponsible bankers. And now they are
using our money to prop up the E.ONs and the Shells of this world.  Using public money to support banks in trashing the climate embodies the absurdity
of the economic and political system we live in. We need to stop our money from
being used to finance tar sands, coal and all fossil fuels, and we need to have
democratic financial institutions that serve the needs to people, communities
and sustainability rather than just lining the pockets of greedy bankers.

One year after
Europe's withdrawal from the Ilisu project: new hope for Hasankeyf
despite restart
of construction
One year ago
on July 8th 2009
Germany, Austria and Switzerland quit their contracts concerning the
Ilisu dam
project with Turkey. In spring 2010 Turkey restarted construction on
the Tigris
river. But now there is new hope that the ancient city of Hasankeyf
does not
have to be destroyed by a giant reservoir. A new study, presented on
July 6th at
an international conference at the renowned Technical University of
Ankara,
shows that the same amount of electricity could be generated in an
alternative
Ilisu project which would not destroy the historic town. The idea is to
build
five smaller dams instead of one mega-dam: http://m-h-s.org/ilisu/upload/PDF/2010/Alternativprojekt.pdf
The benefits
of this alternative
would be:

construction
costs would be lower
the area
to be flooded would be reduced by 27%
Hasankeyf
would not diappear in the reservoir
the same
amount of electricity would be generated

It is still
unclear if the Turkish
government is de facto considering this new proposal as an alternative.
""We
welcome this suggestion by the University of Ankara. It shows that it
is
possible to generate electicty and to save Hasankeyf at the same time"",
said
Ulrich Eichelmann from the Stop Ilisu Campaign.
The
controversy around the Ilisu dam
project has also lead to a change in Turkish civil society. For the
first time
many NGOs and citizen initiatives have united, forming a ""Water
Parliament"" to
stop Turkey's destructive environmental and water politics under the
leadership
of Turkey's environmental minister Veysel Eroglu. ""Ilisu shows many
people and
organisations how important and meaningful their engagement is. Despite
the
restart of construction on site, ‘Ilisu' can be a milestone in the
development
of Turkish civil society"", Mr. Eichelmann stated.
****
Summary
of the most important events since July 2009

On July
8th 2009 Germany, Austria and Switzerland declare their withdrawal from
the Ilisu Project, as project conditions were not fulfilled by Turkey
and international standards were not met.
The three
countries make a recommendation to the European banks and construction
firms involved to also withdraw from 'Ilisu'. The European banks and
construction firms follow this recommendation - with the exception ofÂ  the Austrian company Andritz AG. Turkey announces
the continuation of the project. 
In
December 2009 we receive information on the possible involvement of
China in the projct. However, in Spring 2010, the Chinese ambassador in
Ankara clarifies that there will be no Chinese involvement in the
project.Just
recently a Chinese newspaper
even critizised the project openly: http://translate.google.de/translate?hl=de&ie=UTF-8&sl=zh-CN&tl=en&u=http://epaper.bjnews.com.cn/html/2010-06/06/content_109058.htm%3Fdiv%3D0&prev=_t 
In Spring
2010 Turkey restarts construction in Ilisu. 
Resistance:
for the first time numerous NGOs and civil society initiatives in TurkeyÂ  unite and form the „Water Parliament"". Their goal
is to stop Turkey's delusional dam policies (Turkey plans to build over
1,000 new dams, which would lead to the destruction of all Turkish
wetlands).
On
February 10th 2010 the European Parliament demands in an resolution
that Turkey Â halt the construction of the Ilisu
dam. http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P7-TA-2010-0025+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN 
Beginning
of April 2010 111 Scientists from University of Istanbul request that
the Turkish government not build ‚Ilisu'.
On April 23rd Sabanci Dincer, head of Akbank, declares that the Turkish bank will
finance Ilisu, but will in the future take the ecological and social
impact much more into account when deciding about project financing. 
Beginning
of May an international workshop in Hasankeyf shows an alternative
vision for the ancient town if there is no Ilisu dam. Also
participating: the Technihal University of Vienna. Students of TU
Vienna present their architectural concepts for Hasankeyf. 
In June
2010 Austrian Andritz AG announces that they have signed new contracts
with the government of Turkey. For a sum of 340 million Euro the
company remains the only big European enterprise in the project. http://m-h-s.org/ilisu/front_content.php?idart=649 
End of
June: numerous NGOs (‚Water Parliament') protest in Ankara against
environmental minister Eroglu's water politics and demand his
resignation.
On July
6th the Technical University in Ankara presents an alternative concept
for the Ilisu project at an international energy conference in Ankara.
If this concept were to be applied, Hasankeyf would be saved.

San Franscisco ",RBC tables an offer on tar sands,Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS)  ,United Kingdom,Canadian tar sands ,oil and gas,Canada,"
The tar sands tide may finally be turning at Canada's biggest bank.
RBC is among the largest financiers of Canada's Tar Sands but so far
lacks policies adopted by other banks that seek to limit harm to
Indigenous rights, water quality and climate.
That may be changing. Last week, representatives from RBC showed us
a summary of the new draft Environmental Risk policy that it hopes will
fill the gap. It's too early to draw conclusions- the early draft has
yet to be ratified by the bank's Senior Management-but here's our
initial take on where we see progress relative to other banks, and
where we still see distance.
Bottom line, we think bank is moving in the right direction on
Indigenous rights and the environment but falls well short of
establishing a significantly new standard for responsible banking. On a
scale of 1 (worthless) to 10 (perfect), we gave the draft a 5. Here's
why:  On Indigenous rights, the policy acknowledges ""free, prior and informed
consent"" (FPIC) as an international standard established by the UN, but
requires it from clients only where FPIC is national law.  Elsewhere
(including in Canada's tar sands), the bank relies on the weaker World
Bank standard of ""free, prior, informed consultation"" and meaningful
accommodation. Essentially, RBC is proposing the same ""recognize""
language on FPIC that TD adopted in 2007, though RBC claims its
application will be more robust.
We've been asking RBC's to require evidence of consent from its
clients no matter where they operate, especially in Canada's tar sands
where recent studies show that Indigneous communities are facing
elevated rates of cancer. RBC maintains that demonstrating consent is
impractical given the inconsistent interpretation of ""consent"", the
lack of a legal framework for establishing ""consent"" in Canada and
overlapping and unresolved land claims and interests. We disagree. Our
view is that consent is really just the product of consultation that
takes ""no"" for an answer. It's a hard pill for industry to swallow, but
it's the right thing to do.
On land and water, the bank singles out clients operating in
""environmentally sensitive areas"" which it defines as tropical forests,
UNESCO world heritage sites, critical habitat for species at risk and
High Conservation Value Forests. The policy would require an assessment
of whether clients ""prevent or mitigate"" irreversible adverse impacts
to these areas, but stops short of imposing clear penalties if they
don't.
We've been asking RBC to phase out financing to companies that can't
do business without wrecking the environment. Despite the bank's
assurances that these new guidelines will help weed out bad apples, we
remain unconvinced. We like to see the bank defining ""environmentally
sensitive areas"" but the policy lacks the teeth to avoid doing them
harm.
Finally, we've been asking RBC to meet Unicredit's commitment to
measure and reduce its ""financed emissions"" of CO2 by reigning in
financing to tar sands operators and other large CO2 emitters. They
offered to encourage clients to disclose emissions under the Carbon
Disclosure Project, but won't cut clients that don't. Again, good
sentiment, but ultimately lacking teeth.
We want to see the policy improve but really it's the practice that
counts. And there's no shortage of test cases in the queue. Analysts
expect more than $100 billion to flow into tar sands developments
within the next decade. We're keeping an eye on two: the Enbridge
Northern Gateway Pipeline strongly opposed by a number of well
organized First Nations, and the Total Joslyn North Mine which
threatens the Athabasca watershed with yet another toxic tailings pond.
Both companies will likely come knocking at RBC for financial backing
for these projects. How will RBC respond?
But enough pontificating from us. Let's hear from you! One way or
another, this policy will impact how the banks relate to the growing
controversy over tar sands. How should we respond? Please give us your
questions and ideas in the comments.

Nijmegen, the Netherlands ","New rules for Equator Principles, but no new commitments from banks",Access Bank ,Nigeria,,,,"
The new governance
rules for the Equator Principles that are adopted today by the Equator
Principles Association may improve the cooperation and decision making amongst Equator
Principles financial institutions, but contain no new commitments on
transparency and external accountability.
BankTrack -the
international NGO network closely monitoring the Equator Principles since their
inception in 2003- therefore considers the adoption of this particular set of
governance rules a missed chance for EPFIs to take the ‘Bold
Steps forward'  that civil society expects from them.
The new
‘Rules' formalise a number of existing ad hoc arrangements within the group of
financial institutions that have adopted the Equator Principles. They serve as
basis for the newly established ""Unincorporated Association of Equator
Principles Financial Institutions and Associates"" (‘the Association'). The Association
claims that the Rules bring a number of improvements to the workings of the
Equator Principles:
1.        Greater
clarity on annual public reporting requirements
BankTrack
considers the current reporting ‘requirements'  deeply unsatisfactory in the
light of what affected communities and the public should be able to learn about
the implementation of the Principles in concrete transactions. The new Rules
contain no change in these requirements, and the claimed transparency increase remains
far below what may be expected from institutions that make a public commitment
towards sustainability, yet refuse to share with the public how they intend to
achieve this.
Adopting
banks should move beyond the current meager requirements of merely listing the
number of transactions per category and providing a few lines on implementation,
and commit themselves to much higher levels of transparency and information
disclosure, right down to the project level.
2.           Introduction of an ‘Associate' category for financial
institutions who do not undertake project finance, but may want to use the EPs
as a source of good practice and knowledge for other transaction types beyond
project finance.
BankTrack welcomes any step that leads to the expansion of the scope of the
Equator Principles beyond project finance, covering all transaction with a
potential negative impact on people and planet. But such a scope expansion must
be a binding commitment, incorporated in the Principles itself, and not left to
the good intentions of individual adopting banks, let alone associates.
BankTrack fears that by creating the new category of ‘Associates',
institutions that are ‘interested in discussing sustainability issues', the
Equator Principles run a severe risk to turn into the ‘Equator Flexibles'; a
sustainability bazaar where every bank can pick what it suits them, rather than
the ambitious standard setting initiative that the Principles should aim to be.
3.        A newly introduced process for delisting non-compliant
institutions
BankTrack welcomes the introduction of criteria to enlist and delist mal
performing banks from the Equator Principles. It is disappointing that the
Association has decided to choose ‘meeting extremely limited reporting
requirements' and ‘dutifully paying the membership fee' as the only two criteria
for such a decision.
To effectively deal with the reputational risk of ‘free riders', a decision
on delisting (as well as enlisting) should include a thorough assessment of the
implementation of the Principles in concrete transactions and a convincing roll
out within the institution itself (capacity, staff, procedures). This requires
stronger peer review procedures and a formally established channel through
which grievances of communities affected by projects financed ‘under Equator'
can reach the Association and may trigger such a review.
4.        Greater transparency in the management of the
Equator Principles Association

This may well be the best result of the new structure; for too long, progress
with the Principles has been paralyzed by the lack of an effective decision
making structure for the EPFI group. The new structure paves the way for bold steps
forward on pressing matters related to transparency, accountability, scope
extension and dealing with risks associated with human rights and climate
change. The upcoming revision of the Equator Principles in 2011 provides the
next opportunity for dealing with these issues.
""We congratulate the EPFIs on adopting the new
governance rules. They will hopefully allow the EPFIs to further develop the
initiative"" said Michelle Chan, private finance coordinator of Friends of the Earth US,
""At the same time it is deeply
disappointing that a two year drafting process leads to such a mundane outcome.
When reading the rules it is clear that the liability concerns of bank lawyers
have clearly prevailed over the urgent need to open up to the public and to project
affected communities.""
""Rather than diluting the Equator Principles, by adding a new category
of vague ‘associates', EPFIs should strive to create a bold ‘Coalition of the
Willing', a cohort of banks ready to make a substantial sustainability
commitment, instead of just having interesting conversations about it with
fellow banks,"" says Johan Frijns, coordinator of BankTrack: ""To rescue the reputation of the Equator
Principles as an initiative that matters, EPFIs should display ambition and be
ready to incorporate new commitments on transparency and accountability in the
next revised version of the Principles in 2011.
-------------------------------------------
Notes
 For
the new rules and more information on the Equator Principles see here.
For BankTrack opinion on the principles -including background documents and
correspondence with banks see here.
 In
January 2010, BankTrack submitted a letter to the EPFIs, signed by over hundred
civil society organisations, calling for ‘bold steps forward' with the
Principles on transparency, accountability, scope extension and climate change.
See here.
 Equator
Principle 10 states:
Each EPFI adopting the Equator Principles
commits to report publicly at least annually about its Equator Principles
implementation processes and experience, taking into account appropriate
confidentiality considerations. Such reporting should at a minimum include the
number of transactions screened by each EPFI, including the categorisation
accorded to transactions (and may include a breakdown by sector or region), and
information regarding implementation.
For the
reporting requirements of adopting banks see here.
 The
Bold Steps Forward document calls upon EPFIs to:

 list the names of
all projects that are being financed ‘under equator' on EPFIs website or on the
official Equator website. Every deal signed under the Principles should be
publicly identified as being governed by the Principles;
 covenant with
project sponsors that all projects financed ‘under Equator' are publicly
identified as such on the project sponsors website, and that client
confidentiality be limited to information directly related to the project
sponsor itself.
 identify a minimum level of project information disclosure
that all project sponsors must abide to, that should include all documents
relevant for affected communities and other stakeholders to engage in
consultation and monitoring processes; demand active dissemination of this
information amongst all stakeholders
 come up with a
stringent set of reporting obligations for adopting banks that include public
targets for implementation.
 introduce
mandatory external, third party verification of compliance with these reporting
guidelines
 exclude all banks
from the Principles that do not meet these requirements.

 The
Bold Steps Forward document calls upon EPFIs to establish an accountability/compliance/ombudsman
mechanism for the Principles, along the lines of similar mechanisms that are in
place with multilateral development banks but suited to the specific needs of
private sector banks.

San Fransisco, US ",PNC and UBS: financing the destruction of America’s mountains,,,Mountain top removal coal mining ,mining - coal ,United States,"
Over
the past couple of years, several of the biggest banks in the world
have released policies and statements regarding investments in the
mountaintop removal coal mining industry. According to the MTR report card that
RAN released earlier this year, the biggest banks in the financial
sector have begun to recognize MTR as a risky and socially
irresponsible investment. However, two banks have emerged as major
financiers of MTR companies that other banks won't touch: PNC and UBS.
PNC is a small Pennsylvania based bank that, according to it's website,
provides ""deposit, lending, cash management and investment services to
more than 5 million consumer and small business customers across 15
states and the District of Columbia.""
While PNC claims to be ""the greenest bank in the business""they
have provided financing within the past 2 1/2 years to 6 out of the top
8 corporate MTR companies, including Massey Energy. During this period,
PNC provided over $130 million to MTR companies in bond deals alone.
This
""greenest bank in the business"" lacks a robust environmental policy,
appears to have no corporate social responsibility (CSR) or
environmental staff team and has not responded to any communication
from RAN. Needless to say, PNC has not made any reference to
mountaintop removal in any of its press releases or responsibility
statements.
PNC's
is not alone in their continued financing of MTR. UBS is another bank
that has so far refused to keep up with their financial sector
colleagues and move away from financing the practice.
While
the Swiss are very proud and protective of their Alps, Swiss-based UBS
is apparently comfortable with destroying American mountains. UBS
provided over $760 million in bond deals to 5 of the top 8 corporate
MTR companies, including Massey Energy, in the past 2 1/2 years.
UBS
is a huge financier of mountaintop removal coal mining and while they
have a relatively low profile in the United States, they do have wealth management offices in most states.
PNC
and UBS are outliers in the banking industry because of their refusal
to acknowledge mountaintop removal coal mining as a risky investment.
Both these banks need to hear from activists demanding that they stop
bankrolling the destruction of Appalachia. If you have the time or
inclination, take a look at both of these banks' websites and see if
they have branches or offices near you and pay them a visit! Let us know how it goes and hopefully these two banks will soon join the rest of the banking industry in moving away from the destructive MTR industry. "

Vienna ",Andritz on BankTrack’s black list of companies,,,,,,"
Today the international NGO-network BankTrack added
Andritz AG to their list of firms with particularly devastating social and
environmental practices. The Austrian company is now listed with firms like
Exxon Mobil, Lockheed Martin or Walmart. Reasons behind this are the company's
continuing participation in the Ilisu Dam project in south-eastern Turkey as well as their  involvement or planned involvement in further
destructive projects, such as the Belo Monte Dam in Brazil
or the Bell Bay Pulp Mill in Tasmania.
View the company profile of
Andritz at the BankTrack website.
Johan Frijns, Coordinator of BankTrack: ""We've
added Andritz to our black list because they have developed into a globally
operating company which does not comply with international social and
ecological standards. Andritz continues to participate in projects even when
other companies pull out. No bank aspiring towards sustainability should be
seen financing such a company.""
BankTrack is an international NGO-network which
monitors commercial banks and investment activities and informs the investor
community (bank analysts, companies, pension funds, etc.) and the general
public about the social and environmental impacts of their operations.
Only a few days ago Andritz declared that they would
continue their involvement in the Ilisu Dam project even though Germany, Austria
and Switzerland
withdrew from the project after two years of close monitoring of project
developments. While three European banks and German and Swiss companies
followed their recommendations and also pulled out of the project, Andritz
continues its involvement.

Vienna ",Andritz – Europe's Disgrace,,,Ilisu dam ,energy plants - dams,Turkey,"
ECA Watch Austria and WWF Austria strongly critizised today Andritz' decision to continue their involvement with the Ilisu project on the Tigris river in south-eastern Turkey, and emphasized that such a decision will not go without consequences. The explanations of Andritz-CEO Wolfgang Leitner contradict reality and are nothing but a sequence of skewed facts, say project critics. The company’s decision is also a slap in the face for Germany, Austria and Switzerland’s governments, who withdrew from the project in July 2009 because of its vast impacts and its breach of international standards.
“’Ilisu’ is not built yet and resistance against the project continues. Such greed for profit should not be rewarded. Those who profit from the destruction of ancient Hasankeyf will be branded for a long time”, warned Ulrich Eichelmann from the Stop Ilisu Campaign. He announced further actions to follow against the companies involved in the project. 
A similar reaction came from WWF Austria: ""It is a disgrace that an Austrian company wants to profit from this inhuman and catastrophic project, come hell or high water. With its involvement Andritz shares the responsibility for the destruction of natural and cultural heritage of global significance. This is absolutely unacceptable,” said Andreas Wurzer from WWF Austria.
Andritz-CEO Leitner’s statement, that ’Ilisu’ will be a „particularly modern power plant with high social and ecological safeguarding“ is not only a misrepresentation of facts and a dangerous belittlement of reality but also a verbal slap in the face for the three European governments that withdrew from their contracts with Turkey after several years of monitoring project development. Pivotal for their decision were the expected impacts of the project and the fact that Turkey was unable to meet international standards in their resettlement policies as well as in minimalizing impacts on the environment and on cultural heritage. In this light Mr. Leitner’s statement that „it would not be understandable, if we  did not participate“ is hard to comprehend. One year ago Austrian Finance Minister Josef Pröll together with the Austrian export credit agency Kontrollbank’s head Rudolf Scholten had politically decided Austria’s withdrawal from the project. How will they react to Andritz' decision? 
Mr. Leitner’s reference to the „functioning legal System in Turkey“ also shows that he has either misjudged reality or is purposely misrepresenting the situation. People are still being displaced rather than resettled according to internationally valid standards. People on site have not yet been adequately informed about their future, haven’t seen the authorities’ resettlement plans, and don’t know how they willmake a living after their land and houses have been expropriated.
Only a few days ago the mayor of Ilisu village affirmed that the inhabitants will receive max.. 20,000 Turkish Lira(ca. 10,000 Euro) in compensation for their old houses, while they will have to pay 70,000 TRY for new ones. „Such injustice contradicts all international resettlement standards. Anyone who speaks of a functioning legal system in the light of these facts must put up with the accusation of cynism and denial of reality”, stated Ulrich Eichelmann. 
After this decision, the question remains: how bad do conditions have to get for Andritz to withdraw from a project? “A company that participates in a project like Ilisu will clearly do anything for profit”, concluded Mr. Eichelmann. "

Brussels/ Ghent ",Bankruptcy threatens banks operating in Belgium,Belfius ,Belgium,RWE ,energy plants - coal | energy plants - nuclear | mining - coal ,Germany,"
 
In the past two years BNP
Paribas, KBC, Dexia, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, ING and AXA have invested at
least 25 billion euro in climate-threatening activities including new coal
plants, oil extracted from tar sands, or the decimation of rain forests. Those are
the conclusions from the report ""Bankers on Hot Coals"", which Netwerk
Vlaanderen is presenting today. The NGO calls on the banks to cease investing
in new coal plants immediately en therefore launches the petition Bankruptcy in
cooperation with Greenpeace, WWF, Friends of the Earth, BBL and KWB.
Bankers on hot coalsIf we believe their
advertising, all banks are green. The report 'Bankers on hot Coals' shows a
different reality. Energy companies building new coal plants or extracting oil
from tar sands are being financed by big banks that are operational in Belgium.
Esther Vandenbroucke, co-author of the report for Netwerk Vlaanderen states :
""Banks like to boast about their green image. But as long as banks keep on
investing in coal plants, there is no sustainable banking. We found more than
25 billion euro investments in climate-threatening practices like coal-based
energy, oil extracted from tar sands or the decimation of rain forests.""
Polluting new coal plants = 130 million carsBankers on hot coals makes a remarkable conclusion. If the 70 new coal plants planned in Europe were to
be built, they would emit the same amount of greenhouse gasses as 130 million
cars. Banks that are operational in Belgium don't appear to care about this at
the moment. They are putting our savings into the construction of new coal
plants. Deutsche Bank, for instance, gave a loan for the construction of a new
coal plant that will emit 5.2 million tons of CO2 annually. This equals the
annual emissions of about 1.7 million cars. AXA, KBC, Dexia, Citibank, BNP
Paribas and Deutsche Bank invested 5 billion euro in the German energy giant
RWE Power during the past two years. In 2008, 60% of the electricity produced
by RWE was derived from coal and lignite. RWE plans to build 10 new coal plants
in Germany, The Netherlands, England and Bulgaria in the upcoming years. They
send in the direction of a pitch-black future.
Banks bankruptThe demand to cease
investments in coal plants is being supported by four big environmental
organisations: WWF Belgium, Friends of the Earth Flanders & Brussels,
Greenpeace Belgium and Bond Beter Leefmilieu. ""A euro for energy can only be
invested once. Opting for coal also implies not investing in renewable energy.
These kind of choices lock us into a form of energy production which is
damaging for the climate,"" states Sam Van den Plas from WWF. The workers
movement KWB is also one of the initiators of the petition-action Bankruptcy.
Through fire for climate-friendly bankingFlemish celebrities
such as de Neveneffecten, Joke Devynck, Nic Balthazar en Gili support the
campaign in a daring way. Amidst
the banks at the Kouter in Ghent they will walk for several meters on a carpet
of red-hot coals. With this stunt Netwerk Vlaanderen launches its new campaign
for durable banking, Bankruptcy.

Wien, Berlin ",New Scandals in Ilisu Project,Akbank ,Turkey,Ilisu dam ,energy plants - dams,Turkey,"
According to information from the 'Initiative to keep Hasankeyf alive', the inhabitants of Ilisu village are to be resettled in two months time. It has now become clear that this will threaten their material existence; they will have to pay 50,000 Turkish Lira (ca. 25,000 Euro) more for their new houses than what they receive in compensation from the Turkish state. While they receive max. 20,000 TRY in compensation, the new houses will cost them 70,000 TRY.
""The people in Ilisu are in despair. Even those who used to be in favour of the dam are now against it"", reported Ipek Tasli from the Initiative, who spoke to inhabitants of Ilisu a few days ago. State authorities had  promised, that the inhabitants would become employed on the construction site, but now they mostly employ workers from other regions in Turkey.
Once their land is flooded, the inhabitants of Ilisu who survive primarily on agriculture will have no source of income left. It is questionable how they should then pay the loans for their new houses. Already now they are not able to use parts of their land, as they have already been closed off for construction. The inhabitants have not received any compensation for this land yet.
""The Austrian company Andritz shares responsibility for this fiasco, if it does not withdraw from the project"", commented Thomas Wenidoppler from ECA Watch Austria. Only a few weeks ago it became official that Andritz will be the only European company to remain in the project. All other European partners have followed the recommendations of Germany, Austria and Switzerland, who pulled out of 'Ilisu' in July 2009 because Turkey had not fulfilled project conditions on resettlement, cultural heritage and environmental issues.
Turkey has also broken another promise in the Ilisu project; an article in Hurriyet Daily News from May 24th reported that the antique bridge and El Rizk Mosque will not be spared from perishing in the Ilisu dam reservoir. Until now Turkish authorities had always ensured that they 'save' Hasankeyf's cultural heritage by moving its twelve most important monuments to an Archeology Park close by. The new plan only speaks of building replicas.
""Prime Minister Erdogan's full-bodied promises turn out to be mere delaying tactics in order to appease project critics"", said Heike Drillisch, Coordinator of the German network CounterCurrent. It seems as if Mr. Erdogan does not attach much importance to either the cultural heritage or to the international reputation of his country."" Numerous Turkish and international celebrities and parliamentarians as well as the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) have spoken out for the preservation of Hasankeyf.""

Frankfurt ",Deutsche Bank announces divestment from Elbit,Deutsche Bank ,Germany,Elbit Systems ,arms industry and trade | aviation | security and surveillance systems,Israel,"
·         Deutsche Bank announces divestment
from Israeli arms manufacturer Elbit Systems after campaign from German human
rights organisations·         Elbit Systems supplies Israeli
military and provides components for Apartheid Wall ruled illegal by
International Court of Justice·         Deutsche Bank's divestment follows
similar steps by banks and pension funds in three Scandinavian countries.
Occupied Palestine - Germany's
biggest bank Deutsche Bank has divested the bank's 2% stake in Elbit Systems,
an Israeli arms company that supplies the Israeli military and provides
components for the Apartheid Wall in Occupied
 Palestinian Territory
that was found to be in violation of international law by the International
Court of Justice.   The announcement at the Bank's
AGM today follows a concerted campaign from German human rights organisations.
As part of a long term campaign,
Pax Christi and International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War
(IPPNW) asked Deutsche Bank shareholders to vote against a routine motion of
confidence in the board of directors because of their failure to divest from
Elbit Systems, and activists held a lively demonstration outside the AGM in
Frankfurt am Main.
In response, Deutsche Bank
chairperson Josef Ackermann told the AGM, ""Deutsche Bank is out of Elbit"".
Ackermann went on to explain that the bank could not invest in Elbit because of
its commitment to voluntary codes of conduct such as the UN Global Compact and
even went as far as to deny that Deutsche Bank had ever held shares in Elbit,
in direct contravention to figures published by Nasdaq.com. 
Wiltrud Rösch-Metzler,
Vicepresident of Pax Christi Germany, said, ""The end of the investment in
Elbit is a huge success. Deutsche Bank assured us that they do not have
investments in Elbit. They went out of their way to list numerous standards and
international ethical commitments to which the Bank is party to, highlighting
how Elbit investments would violate them all. This statement is a landmark
position that should guide other German, European and global finance institutions"",
she said.
In a passionate speech,
Rösch-Metzler had earlier told the AGM: ""Do you still remember the days of
apartheid in South Africa?
Palestinians call it an Apartheid Wall, because it surrounds them, closes them
in, shuts them into enclaves; because this Wall creates Palestinian Bantustans.
How can Deutsche Bank profit from the oppression of Palestinians? If obvious
human rights and international law criteria are violated, will the Deutsche
Bank continue to be co-responsible for this?""
The chain of
divestments from Elbit started when Stop the Wall, the grassroots Palestinian
anti-apartheid wall campaign and a long term partner of IPPNW and Pax Christi,
moved together with its Norwegian partners to persuade Norway's
Minister of Finance Kristin Halvorsen to announce that the Norwegian State
Pension Fund had sold its shares in Elbit, worth $5.4 million. Inspired by
this, campaigners in other countries started pressuring finance institutions on
the issue. Danske Bank and PKA Ltd, two of the largest Danish pension funds,
Folksam, Sweden's largest asset manager and ABP, a Dutch asset manager, have
all divested their funds from Elbit Systems. 
A spokesperson for the
Palestinian BDS National Committee (BNC), a wide coalition of the largest
Palestinian mass organisations, trade unions, networks and organisations, said:
""Palestinian civil society warmly welcomes the principled decision taken by
Deutsche Bank's to end its complicity in Israel's oppression of the
Palestinian people. This decision by a bank of the clout and size of Deutsche
Bank, particularly following similar steps by a number of Scandinavian
financial institutions, shows that social and ethical responsibility cannot be
ignored in conducting international business. The BNC calls on all people of
conscience and supporters of universal human rights in Germany to continue their efforts and to ensure
that other German institutions follow the example of Deutsche Bank and divest
from Elbit and every other company, Israeli or international, that profits from
Israel's
occupation and apartheid.""

citizens who share the common goal of creating a more peaceful and secure world
freed from the threat of nuclear annihilation.  This year's annual General
Assembly of the German section has called on the Deutsche Bank to end its
investment in the Israeli arms corporation Elbit. Deutsche Bank has 2% of the
arms company and is the fifth biggest investor in Elbit. IPPNW is a long term
partner of Stop the Wall.

Nijmegen, the Netherlands ",BankTrack calls on banks to stop funding nuclear power,Bank of  ,China,Angra 3 nuclear power plant ,energy plants - nuclear,Brazil,"
 
BankTrack, in cooperation with a number of working
partners, today launches www.nuclearbanks.org,
a new website mapping the involvement of 45 leading commercial banks in funding
nuclear power projects and companies active in the nuclear sector. 
BankTrack considers nuclear energy a grave danger for
people and planet. The renewed interest in nuclear energy also poses a severe
obstacle to achieving a sustainable solution to the climate crisis.
The website provides information on 867 transactions, involving a total
of 124 banks providing finance to over 70 nuclear companies. Between 2000 and
2009, these banks provided a total amount of €175 billion euro to the nuclear
sector. 
The website identifies the top ten of ‘nuclear banks'
as BNP Paribas (France), Barclays (UK), Citi (US), Société Générale (France), Crédit Agricole/Calyon (France), RBS (UK), Deutsche Bank (Germany), HSBC
(UK/HongKong), JPMorgan (US), and the Bank of China. Together, these ten banks
provided €92 billion to the nuclear industry in the period 2000-2009, over half
of the total amount identified by the research.
BankTrack and partners have pledged to confront all
financiers of upcoming nuclear projects, twenty of which are presented at the
website. The website will serve as a platform to inform the public as well as
clients and stakeholders on the involvement of banks in the nuclear sector and
to mobilize massive opposition to this support. Key targets are any banks
considering financing the Mochovce nuclear reactors in Slovakia, the planned Angra III plant
in Brazil, the Jaitapur nuclear plant in India, or the Koeberg plant
in South Africa.
""Nuclear power covers only a few percent of world
energy needs, but it poses massive environmental, health and security hazards.
Building more reactors would also be a dangerous waste of time in global
efforts to combat climate change: emissions of greenhouse gases have to peak
and then significantly decrease in the next ten years, while reactors take a
decade or longer to build. Time and resources must instead be used for
implementation of renewable energy and energy efficiency measures. In many
countries, nuclear policy has become an obstacle to finding effective solutions
to the climate crisis and achieving energy security"" said Jan Beránek, nuclear energy project
leader of Greenpeace International.
 
""Too many well known banks that otherwise have taken
laudable steps towards sustainability, are still investing heavily in the
nuclear industry, putting the world on the wrong energy track. Sustainable
banking and financing nuclear energy are simply incompatible"" said Johan Frijns,
BankTrack coordinator.
""Banks need to
wake up to the fact that nuclear energy is extremely unpopular with the wider
public. For example, a March 2010 European Commission survey found that 52
percent of Europeans consider nuclear power to be a risk for themselves and
their families, with only 17 % in favor of increasing the use of nuclear energy.
This shows that bank support for this dangerous and dirty form of energy will
in the long run alienate many of their customers"", said Heffa Schuecking of
urgewald in Germany.

Piaraçu, Xingu National Park, Brazil ",The Kayapo continue blockades of Amazon highway for the 28th straight day in protest of the Belo Monte dam,,,Belo Monte dam ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"
A group of Kayapo indigenous people led by Chief Megaron Txukarramãe have been blockading the Xingu River crossing of the BR-80 - a major Amazon highway in Mato Grosso State - since April 23 in protest of the government's plans to build the massive Belo Monte Dam. Dozens of Kayapo warriors have been blocking the ferry crossing over the Xingu River for four weeks and are determined to remain there. Their actions have disrupted a major transportation artery for commercial goods in the region.
In a statement issued from the blockade, Chief Megaron referred to President Lula as ""enemy number one"" to Brazil's indigenous peoples, and vowed to maintain the blockade until Belo Monte is canceled or ""die fighting for our rights.""
Chief Megaron has been joined in these protests by Kayapo Chief Raoni Metuktire, an emblematic leader for over 20 years of indigenous resistance to the Brazilian government's plans to dam the Xingu River. In a May 1st interview with the French channel TF1, Chief Raoni said ""I have asked my warriors to prepare for war and I have spoken of this with other tribes from the Upper Xingu. We will not let them .""
Leaders of the Arara, Xipaia and Juruna indigenous peoples of the Lower Xingu echo the vociferous opposition of the Kayapo to the Belo Monte Dam, and have also vowed to lay down their lives to stop the project, which would destroy their communities and livelihoods. ""We are firm in this struggle, and continue more strong and determined than ever to stop Belo Monte,"" said the leader Sheyla Juruna. Attempts to stop the Belo Monte Dam became known around the world last month when filmmaker James Cameron and members of the cast of Avatar joined protests in Brasilia and visited villages on the Xingu River and its tributaries to hear about the plight of the region's indigenous people.
Slated to be the 3rd largest hydroelectric project in the world, Belo Monte would divert over 80 percent of the Xingu River's flow through artificial canals, flooding over 500 sq km of rainforest while drying out a 100 km stretch of the river known as the ""Big Bend,"" which is home to hundreds of indigenous and riverine families. Though sold to the public as ""clean energy,"" Belo Monte would generate an enormous amount of methane, a greenhouse gas 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
Despite legal injunctions against the project's auction, the Brazilian government announced that the auction's winning consortium, ""Norte Energia,"" would proceed with plans to dam the Xingu River. President Lula's insistence that the project move forward at all costs - in spite of serious social, environmental and financial concerns, as well as a massive local and international outcry - continues to be met with fierce denouncements from indigenous people of the Xingu Basin.
""The destruction that would be caused by the massive Belo Monte Dam in the globally essential Amazon Basin would have worldwide ramifications that can't yet be fully comprehended. Indigenous people are determined to disrupt the 'business as usual' model of destructive development projects that ruin the environment and their traditional ways of life,"" said Atossa Soltani of Amazon Watch. ""Indigenous groups from the Xingu Basin have sent the Brazilian government a clear and resounding message that they will not allow the Belo Monte Dam to move forward. A Brazilian and international coalition of organizations and social movements stands in solidarity with these groups, and is mobilizing further social and legal actions."" "

Amsterdam ",Investeringen banken: meer fossiel dan duurzaam,ABN AMRO ,Netherlands,,,,"
Nederlandse banken investeren gemiddeld te
veel in fossiele en te weinig in duurzame energie. Dat blijkt uit het
vandaag gepubliceerde onderzoeksrapport ‘Investeringen in duurzame
elektriciteitsopwekking door Nederlandse banken' van de Eerlijke
Bankwijzer. Willem Verhaak van Milieudefensie, één van de bij de
Eerlijke Bankwijzer aangesloten organisaties: ""Wij roepen banken op om
hun investeringen in de elektriciteitssector snel te verduurzamen. Dat
kunnen ze echter niet alleen. Het nieuwe kabinet moet het
investeringsklimaat voor duurzame energie drastisch verbeteren.""
Voor
een beperking van de opwarming van de aarde tot 2 graden Celsius, moet
er de komende 20 jaar twee keer zoveel geïnvesteerd worden in duurzame
elektriciteit als in fossiele stroom. Op dit moment investeren de
Nederlandse banken gemiddeld echter meer in fossiele
elektriciteitsopwekking (54 procent) dan in duurzame stroom.De
Eerlijke Bankwijzer onderzoekt elk kwartaal opnieuw het beleid van
banken op diverse maatschappelijke thema's en publiceert de resultaten
op de site www.eerlijkebankwijzer.nl. Daarnaast wordt enkele keren per
jaar ook de praktijk van de banken onder de loep genomen, waarbij dan
één van de deelnemende organisaties vanuit het eigen specifieke
werkterrein het initiatief neemt. In tegenstelling tot eerdere
publicaties worden de individuele banken met dit onderzoek nog niet
beoordeeld op hun resultaten. Verhaak: ""Het slechte investeringsklimaat
voor duurzame energie in Nederland is één van de redenen waarom banken
slechts in beperkte mate kunnen investeren in duurzame elektriciteit.
De banken kunnen wel de keuze maken om veel minder te investeren in
fossiele elektriciteitsopwekking en via beleggingen in het buitenland
meer te investeren in duurzame energieopwekking."" De Eerlijke
Bankwijzer roept de Nederlandse banken daarom op de komende jaren hun
energie- investeringen fors te verduurzamen en zal de banken daar over
twee jaar op beoordelen. De praktijkstudie 'Investeringen
in duurzame electriciteitsopwekking' is op initiatief van
Milieudefensie verricht in het kader van de Eerlijke Bankwijzer.De

Turkey ",Construction of Ilisu dam restarted – Austrian Andritz the only European company to remain in the project,Akbank ,Turkey,Ilisu dam ,energy plants - dams,Turkey,"
 
The Austrian company Andritz AG will be the only European company
to remain within the controversial Ilisu dam project on the Tigris River
in south-eastern Turkey.
Alstom (FR/CH) and Züblin (D/AUT), who were also supposed to be involved in the
construction of the dam, have now finally pulled out of the project. This
appears in a report from the Czech General Consulate in Turkey.
According to the report, Andritz will take over the contracts of Alstom,
Züblin's work will be carried out through Turkish companies. After the
withdrawal of three European banks in July 2009, a part of the missing
financing for the project will be taken over by Turkish Halkbank in Bahrain. It is
unclear if the Austrian VA Tech Finance played a role in this - a letter from
the Turkish water agency DSI from April 20th2010 states that
Austrian VA Tech Hydro is responsible for aquiring project loans. (Quote:
""The credit is generated by the finance leader of the project, Va TECH
Hydro Gmbh & Co."")
Just recently an examination of the construction site by ECA Watch Austria showed
that heavy construction work has restarted. Even according to Turkish law this
activity must be illegal, as the contracts were awarded to the international
consortium including the European firms. At the moment dam critics' lawyers are
investigating legal avenues to stop the work. The Turkish water agency DSI
argues, that the Consortium has not changed, as Andritz is still involved.
This shows that Andritz can now make the difference. The decision makers
at Andritz, especially the head of the company Wolfgang Leitner, are in a rare
position: Their involvement or withdrawal can decide about the destruction or
the preservation of this region with its unique natural landscape and cultural
heritage and about the future of 70.000 people. ""If Andritz quits their
contracts as well, the construction has to be halted and there has to be a new
call for tenders"", says Ulrich Eichelmann from ECA Watch Austria, who just returned from the Tigris.
Already in July 2009 Germany, Austria
and Switzerland,
who had granted state guarantees, pulled out of ""Ilisu"", after having monitored
the project for several years. The reasons for their withdrawal were that Turkey had not
fulfilled project conditions concerning environment, resettlement and cultural
heritage and the expected impacts of the project. The European banks followed
this step by withdrawing their loans of approximately €500 million in total. "

San Fransisco ",Rainforest Action Network welcomes JPMorgan’s first public statement on controversial mountaintop removal coal mining,JPMorgan Chase ,United States,Mountain top removal coal mining ,mining - coal ,United States,"
 
Just one day before their
Annual General Shareholder meeting, JPMorgan Chase released their 2009
Corporate Responsibility Report including its first public statement on
financing for companies that practice mountaintop removal (MTR) coal mining. As
laid out in the CR report, JPMorgan ""has undertaken an enhanced review of all
proposed banking transactions for companies engaged in MTR....includ
considerations of a company's regulatory compliance history, as well as
exposure to future regulatory changes and litigation risks, particularly as
they relate to valley fills and water quality issues.""
Below is a statement in
response to JPMorgan's enhanced review of companies that finance MTR from
Amanda Starbuck of the Rainforest Action Network, which has been publicly
campaigning for JPMorgan to release a clear exclusion policy on financing for
all companies who practice mountaintop removal mining for more than a year. JPMorgan's
new guidance on MTR comes just days after a report issued by Rainforest Action
Network, the Sierra Club and BankTrack found that JPMorgan, PNC and UBS were
the lead financiers of companies practicing MTR.
""Rainforest Action Network
is encouraged by JPMorgan's move to address its financing of mountaintop
removal coal mining, the devastating practice of blowing up the Appalachian Mountains and contaminating drinking water
for a tiny amount of coal. This is a welcome step forward.
""JPMorgan has joined but
not surpassed Bank of America and Citi who both announced financing guidelines
on mountaintop removal coal mining in 2008. If JPMorgan wants to lead instead
of follow on environmental responsibility, the way forward is a complete
phase-out of mountaintop removal coal financing.
""We are encouraged to see
that JPMorgan is no longer financing Massey Energy, the leading MTR company in
the country which is currently facing criminal charges for last month's fatal
mine explosion. We will continue to monitor JPMorgan's lending to ensure that
its new position on mountaintop removal coal mining impacts reality
on-the-ground for the people of Appalachia.
""JPMorgan's statements on mountaintop removal coal
mining are a testament to the hard work of Appalachian communities and
activists across the country, whose collective pressure left JPMorgan with
little choice but to begin addressing its support for this devastating form of
resource extraction.""

threatens the livelihoods of 500,000 indigenous people in Southern Ethiopia and
Northern Kenya. By ending the river's natural
flood cycle, it would destroy harvests and grazing lands along the river banks
and fisheries in Lake Turkana, the world's
largest desert lake. The dam will devastate the unique culture and ecosystems
of the Lower Omo
Valley and Lake
 Turkana, both recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
According to news articles in the
Ethiopian press, ICBC has agreed to extend the loan for a contract under which
Dongfang Electric Machinery Corp., a Chinese state-owned company, will provide
equipment for the Gibe 3 project.
Ikal Angelei, the chair of Friends
of Lake Turkana in Kenya,
says: ""The Gibe 3 Project will destroy the lifeline of the Lower Omo Valley and the Lake Turkana
region. It will condemn half a million of the region's most vulnerable people
to hunger and conflict. We ask Chinese banks and companies to stay away from
this disaster.""
Peter Bosshard, the policy
director of International Rivers, comments: ""The World Bank, the African
Development Bank and the European Investment Bank have so far kept their
distance from a project that violates many of their safeguard policies. If ICBC
indeed picks up the slack, it will severely damage China's efforts to be a responsible
actor in the protection of the global environmental.""
Johan Frijns, the coordinator of
the global BankTrack network, says: ""China has made impressive progress
in reforming its banking sector through its green credit policy. Funding an
environmental disaster like the Gibe 3 Dam would make a mockery of the environmental
reform efforts in China's
banking sector.""

San Francisco ","New report card, largest financers of Mountaintop Removal coal mining",Bank of America ,United States,Mountain top removal coal mining ,mining - coal ,United States,"
 
A
new report card issued by Rainforest Action Network, the Sierra Club and
BankTrack ranks nine of the largest banks backing dangerous and devastating
mountaintop removal (MTR) coal mining projects. Among the nine graded are Bank
of America, Citi, Credit Suisse, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley,
GE Capital, PNC and UBS. Failing grades went to PNC, JPMorgan Chase and UBS who
came out as the lead financiers of companies practicing
mountaintop removal coal mining.
A
copy of the report card can be found here.
Since January 2008, the report card found that these nine banks
have provided more than $3.9 billion in loans and bonds to companies practicing mountaintop removal coal mining, including
Massey Energy and Arch Coal.
""The
idea of corporate responsibility has come up repeatedly in recent weeks
following the coal mine and oil disasters. That responsibility extends beyond
profits to the health and wellbeing of our communities. By continuing to
finance mountaintop removal coal mining these banks are throwing that
responsibility aside,"" said Mark Kresowik of the Sierra Club. 
PNC,
which finances almost half of all mountaintop removal coal mining, ranked worst
of the worst. The bank earned an ""F"" for its total failure to take
environmental risks into account in its lending practices. Also earning an ""F""
were UBS and JPMorgan Chase, which respectively finance about one-third of all
the MTR coal mined in Appalachia, and GE Capital,
which backs about one-quarter of all operations.
""PNC,
JPMorgan Chase and UBS received failing grades today as the lead financiers of
mountaintop removal, the devastating practice of blowing up our mountains for
an insignificant amount of dirty coal,"" said Amanda Starbuck of Rainforest
Action Network. ""When it comes to protecting America's mountains and clean
drinking water, we don't grade on a curve. When banks stop funding mountaintop
removal they will move to the head of the class.""
RAN and Sierra Club disclosed the findings of this report card
to each of the nine analyzed banks and offered them the opportunity to improve
their grade with further information or changes to banking policies. In
response to initial report card findings, Morgan Stanley released a public MTR
policy that moved them from a failing grade to a C grade. JP Morgan Chase,
despite a yearlong pressure campaign and their upcoming Annual General
Shareholder meeting on May 18th, has yet to make changes to their MTR
financing.  
Credit
Suisse topped the list, earning an ""A-"" for their efforts to promote
responsible mining practices. Credit Suisse has
confirmed that they do not finance the extraction of coal in a mountain top
removal setting. 
Rainforest Action Network and the Sierra Club are calling for
the nine banks reviewed in this report card to strengthen their policies and
cease their financial support for MTR. The ‘best practice' recommended in the
report card is a clear exclusion policy on commercial lending and investment banking
services for all coal companies who practice mountaintop removal coal
extraction.
Mountaintop removal
mining is a devastating form of mining where companies blow the tops off
mountains to reach a thin seam of coal and then dump the waste rock into
valleys below. This destructive practice has buried nearly 2,000 miles of
streams and threatens to destroy 1.4 million acres of land by 2020. The mining
destroys Appalachian communities, the health of coalfield residents and any
hope for positive economic growth. "

United Kingdom ",‘Clean the banks’ campaigners hopeful for Vince Cable backing on RBS and finance sector demands,Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS)  ,United Kingdom,,,,"
 
Vince Cable will oversee
business and banking in the new UK government, which could signal good news for
campaigners pushing for a clean-up of the financial sector. Campaign groups the
World Development Movement, People & Planet and PLATFORM have been calling
for a stop to reckless behaviour by the banks even before the financial crisis
began. Recently they have organised high profile protests targeting the use of
taxpayers' money by the Royal Bank of Scotland to finance
high-impact oil and gas extraction, including tar sands operations, which are
having devastating impacts on indigenous communities in Canada and
on the climate.
Deborah
Doane, director of the World Development Movement said:""We are pleased to
hear that Vince Cable, who has consistently spoken out in favour of regulating
the banking sector will be part of the new coalition government. Lib Dem
policies have been very progressive in the area of finance sector regulation,
supporting the Financial Transaction Tax, a new Green Investment Bank and
intervention to curb speculation through splitting up the banks. They also
committed at their Party Conference last year to end taxpayers' support for
RBS' investments in tar sands extraction. Introducing these policies from the
outset would signal a real commitment to cleaning up the mess that the
financial crisis has left Britain and
the world in.""
Ian Leggett,
director of People & Planet said:""The LibDems have long
recognised the need to align our ownership of banks such as RBS with broader
policy objectives such as the transition to a low carbon economy. Prompt action
to ensure that public money does not go into tar sands in Canada or
new coal-fired power stations will inspire confidence that this new government
is serious about creating a low carbon future.""
They are also encouraged by
the senior Lib Dem MP's plans to launch a green investment bank, and hopeful
that he will drive forward plans to raise money through a tax on speculative
bank transactions.
Kevin Smith,
co-director of PLATFORM said:""Vince Cable needs to
ensure that the reform of the banking sector involves addressing environmental
as well as financial sustainability. The new government's plans for a Green
Investment Bank will be dramatically undermined if it continues to allow RBS to
use public money to support and expand carbon intensive industries and
operations around the world.""

Madrid, Spain ","Los bancos puntúan bajo en sostenibilidad, transparencia y responsabilidad",Banco Santander ,Spain,,,,"
 
La Red Internacional BankTrack, representada en
España por la ONG SETEM, acaba de presentar su informe ""Close the Gap"" (""Cerrar
la Brecha""), un extenso proyecto de investigación sobre las políticas
gestión de activos de los principales bancos y entidades financieras además de evaluar sus procedimientos de transparencia y responsabilidad.
 El objetivo del informe es estimular
a los bancos y a las entidades financieras para que desarrollen políticas sobre
inversiones a nivel global y a que hagan públicas sus políticas y su compromiso
con los objetivos sostenibles.
Este informe, realizado en colaboración con la
empresa de investigación Profundo, ha analizado, puntuando de 0 a 5, las
políticas de gestión de activos de 49 bancos en 17 países, para siete
sectores principales de negocio (agricultura, pesca, explotación forestal,
industria militar y comercio de armas, minería, petróleo y gas, generación de
energía) y sobre nueve temas relacionados con la sostenibilidad:
biodiversidad, cambo climático, corrupción, derechos humanos, pueblos
indígenas, trabajo, operaciones en zonas de conflicto, tributación y productos
tóxicos.
La lista incluye a las siguientes entidades bancarias:
ABN Amro, ANZ, Banco Bradesco, Banco do Brasil, Bangkok Bank, Bank of America,
Bank of China, Bank of Tokyo- Mitsubishi, Barclays, BBVA, BNP Paribas, China
Construction Bank, Citi, Commonwealth Bank, Crédit Agricole, Credit Suisse,
DekaBank, Deutsche Bank, Dexia, Fortis Bank Nederland, Goldman Sachs, HSBC,
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China,
China Industrial Bank, ING, Intesa Sanpaolo, Itaú Unibanco, JPMorgan Chase,
KasikornBank (Thailand), KBC, Mizuho, Morgan Stanley, National Australia Bank,
Natixis, Nedbank, Nordea, Rabobank, RBC, RBS, Santander, Standard Chartered
Bank, Scotiabank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Société Générale,
Standard Bank, UBS, UniCredit, WestLB, Westpac.
Las 10 principales conclusiones de ""Close the Gap""
1.      
Ninguno
de los bancos ha adoptado políticas para todos los sectores y los temas
analizados. Sin embargo,
WestLB (Alemania) y Barclays (Reino Unido) casi cubren todos los temas
estudiados salvo las cuestiones de Tributación y Operaciones en zonas de
conflicto.
2.      
Comparando
con los datos del año 2007, hoy hay más bancos que desarrollan políticas de
sostenibilidad. Por ejemplo, en 2007 un 27% de los bancos tenían políticas
sobre la industria y el comercio de armas, en 2010 el porcentaje es del
49%.  Los bancos también han desarrollado
más políticas sobre generación de energía, han pasado del 9% en 2007 al 29% en
2010 y un  22% de los bancos han
desarrollado políticas sobre minería y petróleo y gas, en comparación con el 9%
en 2007. Sólo 6 de
los 49 bancos no han desarrollado ninguna política: Bangkok Bank, Banco de China, China Construction Bank,
DekaBank, Banco Industrial y Comercial de China y por último, Kasikornbank.
3.      
Muchas
políticas bancarias son inadecuadas y la mayoría ha puntuado bajo (1 sobre 5). Los bancos con esta puntuación tan sólo han
suscrito los Principios de Ecuador o el Pacto Mundial de las Naciones Unidas, o
bien han desarrollado su propia política pero poco definida y sin incluir  compromisos claros. Sólo en unos pocos
casos los bancos cumplen la mayor parte de los criterios de una buena política
de sostenibilidad. Este es el caso de la política sobre cultivo forestal de
HSBC (4 puntos) o la política sobre agricultura de Rabobank (3 puntos).
4.      
Los
sectores con mayor puntuación media son la minería, del petróleo y el gas y la
generación de energía, cada
uno con una puntuación media de 0,83. La puntuación más alta en cada sector ha
sido de 2 puntos; Rabobank en la minería y el petróleo y el gas, West LB y
Standard Chartered Bank en la generación de energía. El tema con la
mayor puntuación media es el de los pueblos indígenas , con una
puntuación media de 0,94. La puntuación más alta fue de 2 puntos para Morgan
Stanley, JPMorganChase y Rabobank.
5.      
En la transparencia, los bancos han tenido una puntuación
media de 1,5. La puntuación más alta ha sido de 3 puntos para Banco Bradesco,
HSBC, ING, Intesa Sanpaolo.
6.      
En cuanto a rendición de
cuentas, los bancos lograron una puntuación
media de tan sólo 0,81, y la puntuación más alta fue de 2 para Intesa Sanpaolo,
Unibanco Itaú, National Australia Bank, Nedbank, RBS, Santander, Scotiabank y
Westpac.
7.      
El banco
con la puntuación más alta tanto en las políticas sobre sectores como en las de
temas es Rabobank con una media de 1,7 puntos. Este banco ha obtenido la
puntuación más alta en 5 sectores y en 3 temas..
Las siguientes mejores puntuaciones han sido para el HSBC (1,2), el ING (1,16)
y el Santander y WestLB (1,1).
8.      
De los
49 bancos analizados, 28 han desarrollado políticas sobre cambio climático,
lo que refleja una conciencia creciente de los bancos en esta cuestión. Sin
embargo, la calidad de todas las políticas está por debajo de un mínimo
aceptable y faltan compromisos claros en cuanto a la explotación de fósiles y centrales
térmicas. Ningún banco ha recibido una puntuación de 2 o más puntos, 46 de
ellos han obtenido 1 punto.
9.      
En
cuanto a corrupción 37 bancos han tenido una puntuación de 1 punto (por
ejemplo por haber adoptado los Principios de Wolfsberg o el Pacto Mundial de
las Naciones Unidas). Los bancos que han recibido la puntuación máxima en este
tema (2 puntos) han sido RBC, Santander y Standard Chartered Banco. Pero ninguno
de ellos ha desarrollado políticas propias sobre las operaciones en zonas de
conflicto, por ello la puntuación es muy baja para todos ellos. Sólo HSBC
menciona este tema dentro de su política sobre minería y extracción de minerales
y recibe un punto por ello. Según datos que maneja SETEM, a pesar de su
avanzada política sobre corrupción, el Santander estaría participando en la
explotación de recursos naturales en regímenes dictatoriales como Myanmar. Según
estos mismos datos esta entidad posee y/o gestiona acciones de Total que extrae
gas en la costa de Myanmar, ascendiendo a 65.840.000 de dólares  el importe de su inversión y/o gestión en el
capital social de esa entidad.
10.  
En
cuanto al análisis de los bancos de países de economías emergentes, se ha
observado que los bancos tailandeses son los que peor puntúan. Esto se debe al
hecho de que no han desarrollado políticas de sostenibilidad propias o no se
han adherido a los acuerdos internacionales. Los bancos chinos han mejorado en
los últimos años tanto en sus políticas como en la transparencia de sus
operaciones. Por ejemplo, Industrial Bank ha sido el primero y único banco
chino que ha adoptado los Principios de Ecuador; posteriormente, ha publicado información
sobre proyectos específicos de una manera que no lo habían hecho ninguno de los
otros bancos que han adoptado ese acuerdo. Pero son los bancos brasileños los
que puntúan mejor comparados con los otros bancos de los países que forman el
grupo denominado BRIC (Brasil, Rusia, India, China): especialmente en cuanto a
la transparencia con una media de 2'3 puntos.
SETEM denunciaba la semana pasada que 146 entidades financieras de 16 países,
incluido España que ha firmado y ratificado la Convención sobre Bombas de
Racimo, invierten y prestan servicios financieros por valor de 43.000 millones
de dólares a 7 empresas fabricantes de bombas de racimo.
 

 ""Close the Gap"" es el tercer informe elaborado por BankTrack,
precedido en 2006 por ""Shaping the future of sustainable finance"" (""Modelando
el Futuro de las Finanzas Éticas"") y en 2007 por ""Mind the Gap"" (""Atención a la
Brecha""), del cuál SETEM ya se hizo eco 
http://madrid.setem.org/ventana_not.php?arg=67 
 Como resultado de la actual situación y crisis del sector financiero,
algunos de los bancos incluidos en los informes previos han desaparecido y otros
han reaparecido sólo nominalmente.
 ""Close the Gap"" incluye el análisis de algunos bancos chinos y de otras
economías emergentes.

London ",NGOs sound warning over one of year's largest IPOs,Morgan Stanley ,United States,,,,"
The preliminary offering prospectus of Russian chemical fertiliser producer Uralchem glosses over several serious risks, says an international coalition of civil society organisations. Their research uncovers significant violation of environmental regulations by the company, which could lead the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources to force plant closures.
The coalition addressed the IPO bookrunners (UBS, Morgan Stanley, and Renaissance Capital) with an open letter urging them only to support the IPO if the company seriously commits to resolving its social and environmental problems. According to the report published alongside the open letter, Uralchem’s disregard for environmental safety has lead to several fatal accidents in the past year, and seriously damages the quality of air and water in the towns of Kirovo-Chepetsk, Voskresensk and Berezniki.
In Voskresensk, a 200m tall mound of phosphogypsum, illegally heaped by Uralchem’s plant, threatens to leak toxic phosphoric acid into Moscow River. In 2010 alone, the Russian Ministry for Natural Resources made three announcements that may herald a criminal court case against Uralchem and its Voskresensk plant. This is only one in a host of problems (environmental crimes, financial machinations, neglect of equipment and employees, and various corresponding court cases) that, according to the NGOs, should ring loud alarm bells for the company’s bookrunners and potential future investors.
Uralchem’s plans to build a reprocessing plant in Dieppe, France, not only met strong resistance from locals and environmentalists (Les Verts, Europe Ecologie) but also attracted the attention of a number of MPs. This political risk has likewise been overlooked by the preliminary offering prospectus.
“We would like to warn investors who plan to put their money in a company with such a reputation. Uralchem have time and again acted completely irresponsibly towards Russian society, state, and minority shareholders, so we have serious reasons to doubt it will be more responsible to investors from abroad. We think that the money made on the IPO will be used to pay off the company’s debts, while Uralchem’s plants continue to choke whole towns and produce fertilisers which fail quality control by the lorry load,” – said Maxim Shingarkin, Fond Grazhdanin.
“We do not want to see our town suffering from toxic pollution. Or consumers in France and the UK endangered by Uralchem’s dubious quality fertiliser from Dieppe. Or investors in the West putting their money into this dangerous corporation. So an IPO should only be carried out when the company cleans up its act,” – said Iolanta Avril, Les Verts, Dieppe.

Nijmegen, the Netherlands ",BankTrack calls upon banks to Close the Gap on investment policies,ABN AMRO ,Netherlands,,,,"
BankTrack,
the international NGO network monitoring the banking sector, today presents Close the Gap, an extensive research project
on the quality of lending and investment policies of major international banks . The results are available as a report and online website section.
The aim of
the research project was to evaluate to what extent banks have incorporated
sustainability criteria into their lending and investment policies. To assess
the quality of policies, BankTrack has evaluated the policies of 49 banks from
17 countries for seven key business sectors and on nine sustainability issues.
In addition, the project reviews the performance of banks on transparency and
accountability. All policies are scored on a scale from 0 to 5, using a
benchmark developed by BankTrack in cooperation with Profundo, an economic
research consultancy.
To
stimulate banks to make public commitment on their sustainability goals, the
assessment only includes policies that are placed in the public domain and can
be reviewed by the public. The report also only focuses on the commitments made
in the policies itself; it does not assess banks' implementation of the
policies.
Close the Gap is the third study of this kind undertaken by BankTrack to stimulate
the development of world-class investment policies by the banking sector. It was
preceded by Shaping
the future of sustainable finance in 2006 and Mind
the Gap in 2007.
Jora
Wolterink, responsible within BankTrack for the Close the Gap research: ""The
results of the report show a mixed picture. Despite the turmoil caused by the
financial crisis, many banks have continued to develop more policies covering more
sectors and crucial sustainability issues. Yet notwithstanding some encouraging
exceptions, the overall quality of policies still leaves a lot to be desired. We
hope this report encourages banks to continue this process, and to disclose
more information on their policies.""
Findings:

 More banks have
more publicly available policies in place. In 2007, 27% of the banks had
policies in place on military industry
and arms trade, with 49% in 2010. Banks have also developed more policies
on power generation; from 9% in 2007
to 29% in 2010. 22% of banks developed policies on mining and oil and gas,
compared to 9% in 2007. Only 6 banks out of 49 have developed no policies at
all (Bangkok Bank, Bank of China, China
Construction Bank, DekaBank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and
Kasikornbank).


 No bank has
adopted policies for all sectors and issues covered in the report. WestLB
(Germany) and Barclays (UK) come close, with only the issues Taxation and Operation in conflict zones not covered
by their policies.


 Most policies do
not meet the criteria for what BankTrack considers an adequate, let alone a
good policy; the large majority of policies received a score of only 1 point. Only
in a few cases do banks meet most of the requirements for a good policy, for
example HSBC for its sector policy on forests (4 points) and Rabobank's policy
on Agriculture (3 points). 


 The sectors with
the highest average scores are mining,
oil and gas and power generation, each with an average score of 0,83. The highest
score on each sector is 2; Rabobank on mining and oil and gas, West LB and Standard
Chartered Bank on power generation. 


 The issue with
the highest average score is indigenous
peoples, with an average score of 0,94. Highest score was 2 for Morgan
Stanley, JPMorganChase and Rabobank.


 On transparency procedures, banks score an
average score of 1,5. Highest score is 3 for Banco Bradesco, HSBC, ING, Intesa
Sanpaolo). 


 On accountability, banks score an average score
of 0,81. Highest score is 2 for Intesa Sanpaolo, Itaú Unibanco, National
Australia Bank, Nedbank, RBS, Santander, Scotiabank and Westpac.


 The bank with the
highest average score for both sectors and issue policies is Rabobank, with an average
score of 1,7. The bank receives the highest score in 5 sectors and 3 issues.
Second best scores HSBC (1,2) followed by ING (1,16). Santander and WestLB share position four with
an average score of (1,1).


 28 banks out of
49 banks have developed own policies on climate
change, reflecting a growing awareness of banks that this is a crucial
issue to tackle in their business operations. However, the quality of almost
all policies is below standard, lacking for example clear commitments on
phasing out financing of fossil fuel exploration and coal power plants. No bank
receives a score of 2 or more, with 46 banks scoring 1 point.


 On corruption 37 banks score 1 point. RBC,
Santander and Standard Chartered Bank score best with 2 points. Not a single
bank has developed specific policies on how to operate in conflict zones, which leads to a poor score for all
banks. Only HSBC mentions the subject in its mining and metal policies and
receives 1 point. 

Johan
Frijns, BankTrack coordinator, states: ""There are two big gaps that banks must
close: one is between what is in now in place as policies and what is required
to adequately deal with sustainability issues in a specific business sector. The
other gap is between having well written policies in place and then putting
them into practice in such a way that they make a real difference for local
communities and the environment.""

Turkey ",Akbank announces stronger environmental protection in reaction to Ilisu dam controversy,Akbank ,Turkey,Ilisu dam ,energy plants - dams,Turkey,"
When presenting its first sustainability report Akbank's Chairwoman Akbank Sabancı Dinçer announced that in the future the bank would act more responsibly and take to assess more thoroughly if projects impact the rights of children, environment or ethical principles. As the Turkish daily Hurriyet reports on April 16, 2010 the sustainability report has brought „new inspiration"" for the bank's management and led to a new understanding of investment and engagement.
Suzan Sabancı Dinçer mentioned the controversy around the Ilisu dam project in Southeast Turkey as a reason to integrate a special article on environmental protection into the bank's guidelines. Together with the Turkish Garantibank Akbank pledged to covers part of the funding gap of the Ilisu project. This gap originates from the withdrawal of European export credit agencies and private banks due to unsolved environmental and social problems of the project in summer 2009. The article says that Akbank will not finance projects with environmental impacts in the future, its involvement in the Ilisu project was beyond question though, Sabancı Dinçer stated.
„The numerous campaign activities in Turkey and Europe are obviously effective"", Heike Drillisch from CounterCurrent welcomes Sabancı Dinçer's announcement. The German network has followed the Ilisu dam project for many years and in the past months initiated a letter writing campaign and vigils in front of European Akbank offices. „It is completely inacceptable for Akbank to remain part of the Ilisu project after this announcement.""
The Ilisu dam was a project of the Turkish treasury and the bank had therefore not had accessed the complete documents, Sabancı Dinçer had argued to explain Akbank's involvement.
„The approval of such a controversial project like the Ilisu dam without a proper assessment of all records provides an alarming evidence of incapacity"", states Halime Yakut of CounterCurrent. „Akbank must announce its immediate withdrawal from the project and urge the Turkish government to irrevocably stop its construction.""

Brazil ",Belo Monte: The pressure is on,,,Belo Monte dam ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"
The pressure is mounting against the controversial Belo Monte Dam  on the Amazon's Xingu River. The past few weeks have been marked by massive protests, the entry of James Cameron and Sigourney Weaver into the campaign, legal battles and a worldwide media blitz.
After three injunctions by a Federal Court judge to suspend the project's development were overturned by a politically-motivated superior court judge, the project was auctioned off to private investors on April 20. The winning consortium of nine Brazilian companies, known as Norte Energia, will get billions of dollars in public subsidies if the dam project is built.
But the struggle is not over yet. Throughout Brazil, indigenous, environmental and social movements organized protests in more than nine cities in eight states to coincide with the auction. Internationally, phone calls begun pouring into Brazilian Embassies, condemning the government's interference in the judicial system and attempts to push through the project at all costs.
Meanwhile, boats full of indigenous people, including Kayapo, began arriving at the proposed dam site located on Pimental Island on the Xingu River's Big Bend to establish a permanent village to block dam construction. They have vowed to do everything in their power to stop the dam from being built. "

Brasilia, Brazil ",Belo Monte auction goes forward after  court overrules second injunction,,,Belo Monte dam ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"
Today's bidding
process for the controversial Belo Monte Dam project was marked by protests and
confusion as a second injunction issued late yesterday suspended the dam
auction overnight, throwing the bidding process into a state of chaos just
minutes before it was set to begin.   Throughout Brazil, indigenous,
environmental and social movements organized protests in more than nine cities
in eight states. Internationally, phone calls begun pouring into Brazilian
Embassies, condemning the government's interference in the judicial system and
attempts to push through the project at all costs.  
Thousands of
people including indigenous people, the Brazilian Movement of Dam-Affected
People, the Landless Workers Movement, and environmentalists are engaging in coordinated
simultaneous protest actions in Brasilia and in the capital cities Fortaleza,
Florianópolis, Porto Alegre, Porto Velho, Belo Horizonte, Belém, Campina
Grande, and the city of Altamira, which would be partially flooded by the Belo
Monte reservoir.    Meanwhile, boats full of indigenous people, including Kayapo, began arriving on
the proposed dam site located on Pimental Island on the Xingu River's Big Bend
to establish a permanent village to block dam construction.  Protesting the dam project in Brasilia, Greenpeace and indigenous peoples
blockaded the entrance of ANEEL, the Brazilian national electrical energy
agency. In Belem, 700 local people occupied the offices of Electronorte. And
near the town of Altamira, the Landless Workers Movement and the Movement of
Dam-Affected People (MAB) blockaded the TransAmazon Highway.  The Belo Monte controversy captured worldwide headlines last week after Avatar director
James Cameron and actors Sigourney Weaver and Joel David Moore visited the
Xingu region and joined protests by indigenous and locally affected populations
in Brasilia against the dam project. The controversy has dominated news
headlines in Brazil.   ""The Lula government is clearly pressuring the courts to approve Belo
Monte against the rights and interests of indigenous people and the local
populations of the Xingú, and it's our lives at stake.  Even so, the
people affected by this dam are united and determined to stop the project, we
will not give up this fight,"" said Sheyla Yakarepi Juruna of the Juruna
people, who met with judges on Monday urging the President of the Appellate
Court for Region 1, Jirair Meguerian, to uphold the injunction.  On Friday, April 16th, a regional appellate court overturned a decision by
Federal Judge Antonio Carlos de Almeida Campelo to suspend the preliminary
license for the dam and cancel the auction, scheduled for Tuesday, April
20th.  In his ruling, de Almeida considered the project to present a
""danger of irreparable harm.""  A second injunction to suspend
the decision on April 19th was also overturned by the Appellate Court just
moments before the auction was set to begin and Brazil's electric utility ANEEL
has reinstated today's auction.
The generating
capacity of Belo Monte would be the world's third highest behind Three Gorges
and Itaipú dams. Two consortia vied for the rights to build the project: Norte
Energia, which includes the state-owned CHESF and eight private companies; and
Belo Monte Energia, which includes the state-owned Eletrosul, in addition to five
private companies including mining giant Vale. Major investors such as Alcoa,
GDF Suez, Odebrecht, and Camargo Corrêa chose not to participate in the bidding
process due to concerns over a lack of economic viability, project delay, and
interest in other mega-investments. 
To build Belo
Monte, the winning consortium would need to dig two huge canals that would
involve moving more earth than was dug for the Panama Canal to divert water
from the river to an artificial reservoir.  By doing so the Big Bend or
Volta Grande - home to the Paquiçamba indigenous territory of the Juruna people
and the Arara people - would be dried out, gravely affecting the livelihoods of
indigenous and riverine families who depend on the water for subsistence. 
All told some 45,000 people are directly affected by the either flooding or
diversion of the river.    International groups continue to join ranks with their counterparts in
Brazilian civil society in pressuring the Brazilian government to suspend Belo
Monte, as organizations and individuals around the world called local Brazilian
embassies to protest the government's plan to build the project despite
widespread violations of indigenous rights. 
""The
violation of indigenous rights is a matter of national and international
concern. Brazil doesn't need the Belo Monte Dam. By investing in energy
efficiency Brazil could avoid the need for as many as 14 Belo Monte dams and
save billions of dollars in the process. Belo Monte Dam just doesn't make
sense,"" said Aviva Imhof, Campaigns Director of International Rivers.  Financially, the US$12 - $17 billion Belo Monte Dam is a risky project,
generating only 10-30 percent of its 11,233 Megawatts (MW) installed capacity
during the dry season, and an annual average of only 4,462 MW. To make the
project viable in a context of huge financial uncertainties and pressure from
private investors to lower the auction's price ceiling, the government has had
to draw from public pension funds and issue US$4 billion of credit from the
public Brazilian National Development Bank (BNDES).  Just to meet the
project's 11,233 MW generating capacity, additional costly dams would need to
be built further upstream, threatening a vast area of tropical rainforests and
affecting many of the 24 indigenous groups along the Xingu River. "

The Hague ",International Court of Justice rules on Uruguayan Botnia case,Crédit Agricole ,France,Botnia pulp and paper mill ,forestry - pulp and paper,Uruguay,"
With nearly a 4-year road block firmly in place on the
Argentine Uruguayan border in protest over a World Bank (IFC-financed) Finnish
pulp mill, the long-awaited International Court of Justice (ICJ) verdict came
in today, clearly legitimizing local protests and indicating that ‘Uruguay
violated international law' in the unilateral decision to allow the Finnish
mega pulp mill Uy Metsa Botnia to go up on the border.  ""By thirteen votes to one, , that the Eastern Republic of Uruguay has breached its
procedural obligations under Article 7 to 12of the 1975 Statute of the River
Uruguay"" ...  ""Uruguay did not transmit to the CARU  ... despite the request made to it by the
Commission to that effect on several occasions.  The initial environmental
authorizations were therefore ... without complying with the procedure"".   ""Uruguay granted an authorization for Botnia for
the first phase of the construction of the Botnia mill and an authorization to construct
a port terminal for its exclusive use and to utilize the river bed for
industrial purposes, without informing ...  by not informing ... has
failed to comply with the  obligation "".   ""Uruguay failed to comply with its obligations to
notify plans to Argentina . *  The court finds that Uruguay was not entitled ...
either to authorize the construction of or to construct the planned mills and
the port terminals. And that by authorizing the construction of the mills and
the port terminal at Fray Bentos ... Uruguay failed to comply with the obligation
to negotiate . Uruguay therefore, in the view of the Court, ""disregarded
the whole of the co-operation mechanism.""  This verdict is a blow to the World Bank's
International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the international financial
community that came in behind the Finnish pulp mill Botnia, providing key
financing that made the project viable. Today, the magnitude of the social and
political dispute caused by this project is enormous. Communities are divided,
two otherwise friendly countries are engaged in a long standing legal battle,
and millions, even billions of dollars are lost yearly due to road blocks in
place opposing this now illegal investment.  Knowing full-well of the outstanding legal dispute
between Argentina and Uruguay over the pulp mill, the World Bank (IFC), Nordea
(a Swedish private bank), Calyon (the financial arm of the French Credit
Lyonnais), and Finnvera (the Finnish state owned Export Credit Agency), pushed
by the IFC, all decided to move forward with the loan, ignoring the World
Bank's Legal Council concerns over the potential illegality of the project, and
ignoring the World Bank's International Waterways Policy 7.0 which states that
the World Bank should not finance projects that violate international law.  The World Bank's IFC decided in November of 2006
to give US$370 million to Botnia, a Finnish paper pulp mill producer, despite
the unresolved legal dispute between Argentina and Uruguay over the legality of
the mill. The affected community within the sphere of impact (which is
overwhelminglyaligned against the investment), NGOs and the Argentine
government insisted that the IFC and other banks, such as Calyon and Nordea,
should wait for the ICJ verdict, before moving to provide financing for the
mill. IFC's portion of the investment, which amounts to 20% was key, as it
would in turn give a green light to other financial institutions such as ING,
Calyon, Nordea, Finnvera (the Finnish State Export Credit Agency) to
participate in theinvestment, making the project viable.  The Dutch bank, ING, decided to pull US$480
million in financing following a verdict by the World Bank's Compliance
Advisory Ombudsman, which agreed with the local community on alleged violations
of the project of the IFC's Social and Environmental Safeguards. Calyon's Corporate
Social Responsibility team, also showed concern over financing the mill, but
financial drivers at Calyon pushed forward, despite their sustainability team's
warnings, claiming they did not need to follow social and environmental
safeguard commitments under the Equator Principles because the loan to Botnia
was a general loan and not project finance.  The IFC, which collected and guided information
about the projects' social and environmental compliance, had to send Botnia
back to the drawing board several times, following an unfavorable verdict from its
Compliance Advisory Ombudsman (the CAO) who found the project seriously
violated the IFC's procedural norms and safeguards. The question of legality,
at the time, was being defined at the International Court of Justice, and would
not be resolved for several years (the verdict took 4 years in total). The
World Bank's lawyers expressed concern over the bank's potential complicity if
it financed the project if it later turned out that authorization of the project
was in violation of international law, which is precisely what has happened.  Nonetheless, IFC plowed on, despite the warnings,
despite egregious procedural errors in project preparation which were uncovered
by the Ombudsman, and most importantly despite massive protests by stakeholder communities.  In the final stretch to the World Bank's Board of
Director's decision, IFC's Executive Vice President, the Swedish national Lars
Thunnel stated to the Bank's Board of Directors ""If we had to stop financing
every time a community complained, we'd never finance any projects"". At the
time of the Board vote, the Finnish government (which was a financial
stakeholder in the project) held the EU Presidency, and strongly lobbied the
World Bank to approve the loan, despite many indicators that showed the project
was not only in non-compliance with bank policy, but that indeed it was likely
the ICJ would rule it violated international law.  This insensitivity of the IFC to stakeholder
communities has been a repeated problem in large scale private investment
projects in sensitive environmental sectors and several members of the Board of
Directors confided to representatives of stakeholders in the Uruguayan pulp
mill conflict, and to officials of the Argentine government, that they were
unhappy with how the IFC has handled consultations, but that politics at the
Bank were likely to favor investment. EU Trade Commissioner Perter Mandelson
even traveled to Argentina to pressure then President Nestor Kirchner to back
off from the Finnish investment or face eventual trade problems with the EU.  Lars Thunnel, who heads the IFC, is an investment
banker from the Nordic states; coincidentally Nordea and Finnvera are two large
multinational banks (private and State owned, respectively) composed of Nordic
financial interests. They both came in strong with funding for Botnia. Both
banks are run by many of Thunnel´s financial colleagues, raising accusations
from stakeholders that this is just another example of how the banking
community makes back-room business deals amongst buddies, ignoring community
concerns. NGO´s have claimed for years, that voluntary agreements under the
Equator Principles signed by some 60+ multinational banks have had little
influence in steering bank decisions on sensitive social and environmental investments.  The IFC was adamant about approving the loan, and
fought hard at the Bank's Board of Directors, ignoring local concerns. At one
point the IFC misinformed the Board of Directors indicating that the project
enjoyed broad public support, only to see the largest over march against one of
their projects 10 days later. Community stakeholders who met with Thunnel
shortly before the Board vote insisted that either his environmental and projects
staff was incompetent in missing such large local opposition, or it was lying
to the Board, and that IFC should hold financing until the ICJ case was
resolved. This fumbling of consultative procedures and errors in due diligence
by IFC has characterized the handling of the Uruguayan Botnia pulp mill
investment from the beginning.  The community has marched yearly to commemorate
its´ struggle against the World Bank and the Finnish pulp mill, with upwards of
100,000 marching each year. The next march planned this month on April 25th
will likely draws thousands following this ICJ verdict, legitimizing local
claims that Botnia's project is illegal. On the eve of the World Bank loan
approval, on November 20th, 2006, the community held a vigil awaiting the vote.
After the IFC confirmed two loans to Botnia for US$370 million, they never left
and no one has been able to cross from Uruguay to Argentina (or back) at its'
most important border crossing since.  The ICJ ruling clearly establishes that Uruguay
violated the bi-national waterways treaty that governs the water border between
Argentina and Uruguay, by not consulting Argentina on the decision to allow for
such a large contaminating industrial project to go up in what have
historically been pristine river lands and a sensitive ecosystem, with local
economic development grounded on eco-tourism. Pulp mills bring algae, noise pollution,
heavy industrial traffic and putrid rotten egg smell, which have already
destroyed the Uruguayan tourist sector at the mills site, and will likely do
the same over time to the Argentine region immediately across from the mill.  But the verdict comes much too late as the mill,
largely thanks to IFC and the other financial institutions that followed behind
(Calyon, Nordea, and Finnvera among others) has already been built and began
operations in 2007, one year after the IFC gave Botnia the two loans. Botnia is
one of the world's large pulp mill operations, dumping millions of gallons of contaminated
water into the Uruguay River each day. The plant operators claim that their
production is so clean that it actually improves the quality of the river,
which they claim is already polluted. The plant dwarfs other similar plants in
Finland which have been progressively closed to transfer operations to
developing countries where environmental controls are more lax, where it is
cheaper to operate, and which offer lucrative financial benefits. Botnia
operates in an entirely tax free zone, exports all of its production for
European and Asian consumption, and employs only 300 people.  The verdict provides some formal retribution to
the community, who can now claim that they were indeed right in opposing the
mill on ground of its' illegality, however, it fails to order a plant
relocation, which is what the IFC should have recommended from the early stages
of project preparation to ease the bi-national tensions which quickly escalated
as time passed and no action came from IFC.  Now everyone must live with the a poor decision
made by the World Bank which has led not only to promoting an illegal
industrial project, but which has caused unimaginable strife between two
otherwise friendly communities and countries. The road block remains firmly on
the bridge, the community shows no intention of tiring, and with this verdict
it is very likely that it will be there for a long time to come!     "

Zürich ",Berne Declaration reveals: Swiss banks cooperate with human rights abusers,Credit Suisse ,Switzerland,,,,"
Forced labour in Uzbekistan,
forced displacement in Papua-New Guinea, toxic waste in Côte d'Ivoire: time and again,
Credit Suisse und UBS are seen cooperating with companies accused of human
rights abuses. The Berne Declaration (BD) urges Switzerland's
largest banks to develop binding human rights standards and to make them
accessible to the public.  
The BD investigated the financial links between the two largest Swiss
banks and companies embroiled in controversies about serious human rights
abuses - involving the right to life, the right to safety, the right to health
and the right to food among others. Credit Suisse, for instance, is an
important player in the financing of cotton exports from Uzbekistan. Cotton
production in this Central Asian country is based on a state-controlled system
of forced labour including child labour. UBS on the other hand bankrolls a
company that operates a mine in an area of Papua-New Guinea from which
residents have been forcibly expelled and their homes burnt to the ground.
These and 17 other cases are documented on the BD-campaign-website banksandhumanrights.ch launched
today and in the report ‘Without
Map or Compass, Credit Suisse, UBS and Human Rights' BD launches today.
In recent years, the work of UN Special Representative for Business and
Human Rights, John Ruggie, has revitalized the debate about the duty of
corporations to respect human rights. Mr. Ruggie stated that most corporations
have no procedures in place that might provide evidence for a serious
commitment to human rights. Yet such procedures of due diligence are
indispensable to hold corporations to their responsibility to respect and
protect human rights, according to the Special Representative.
This is precisely what we ask Credit Suisse and UBS to
do - no more and no less.
We want the two banks to develop a comprehensive human
rights policy including a prior, in-depth investigation into the possible
effects on human rights of all business activities planned. The implementation
of this policy must be guaranteed by standards and procedures developed by each
company and made publicly accessible like those of other global banks. There is
no more space for secrecy in the banking sector.

Brazil ",Belo Monte Dam: The Pressure is Rising,,,,,,"
It's been a fabulous
couple of weeks for the campaign to stop the massive Belo Monte Dam on the
Amazon's Xingu River. Momentum is building - in public opinion, in the courts
and in the legislature - so much so that a Federal Court yesterday suspended
the project's development! 
It all started last week when construction giants Odebrecht and Camarga Correa
- no strangers to controversial dam projects - announced that they were not interested in building the project because it was not economically viable at the price
set by the Brazilian government.  This has left the government scrambling
to find other potential bidders for the project, resulting in delays in the
date for finalizing expressions of interest in the project.   The lack of economic viability is no surprise to the coalition of groups
fighting the dam, who have long argued that the dam is an expensive way to
deliver energy to Brazil. While the project's installed capacity will be more
than 11,000 MW, during the 3-4 month low water season it will generate as
little as 1,000 MW of power, leaving most of the project's turbines at a
standstill. Such a small generating capacity for several months of the year
doesn't justify the high investment cost of more than US$10 billion.  The exit of these two powerful construction companies caused President Lula to
show his true colors. He sputtered that ""There's one thing you can be sure of:
we'll do Belo Monte"" whether or not the private sector is interested in
investing, despite having promised last year not to ""shove Belo Monte down
anyone's throats.""
But President Lula may have more on his hands than he
bargained for. On Monday, James Cameron and Sigourney
Weaver lent their star power
to the campaign, joining a protest of more than 700 dam-affected and indigenous
people in Brasilia to demand the cancellation of the project. James Cameron
said he was being ""drawn into a situation where a real-life Avatar
confrontation is in progress. What's happening in Avatar is happening in Brazil
and places like India and China, where traditional villages are displaced by
big infrastructure projects.""   The protest got massive media attention, beaming news of the controversial project across the globe, and
leading President Lula to lash out at international critics of the project, stating that ""those who already
destroyed their own environment don't need to be coming here making guesses
about ours."" Ironically, its the promoters of Belo Monte who are making
guesses about their environment: there are still many unanswered questions
about the project and its impacts.
As if the prayers of Monday's protestors were heard,
yesterday a Federal Court ordered the suspension of Belo
Monte's provisional environmental license and the cancellation of the auction, scheduled for
next Tuesday. The decision is in response to a civil action filed by Brazil's
Federal Attorneys, who claim that the project violates a section of the
constitution concerning the exploitation of water resources on indigenous
lands. This is a huge setback for the government, who will presumably appeal
the decision to a higher court.   But the Federal Attorneys still have at least one more action up
their sleeve, which was also filed last week. They are questioning
irregularities in the approval of the environmental license for the project,
including blatant disregard for the arguments and concerns presented during the
public hearings and failure to consider any scientific data about what sort of
water releases would be required to maintain life along the Big Bend of the
Xingu. The environmental licensing process at IBAMA was beset by irregularities, and two senior officials resigned due to the
political pressure they were receiving to approve the environmental license for
the project.   To top it all off, concerns are growing in the national congress about the
project. Last week, at a hearing in the Environmental Commission of the House of Representatives, the House and Senate
agreed to conduct a joint investigation into the Belo Monte, Estreito and
Madeira dam projects. Senator Marina Silva, former Environmental Minister and
Green Party Presidential Candidate, is organizing a Senate hearing on the
involvement of the Brazilian national development bank, BNDES, in bankrolling
Amazonian dam projects, and Senator Pedro Simon called for transparency and oversight in the auction
process, expressing concern about the government's plans to use state pension
funds to finance the project.   As sure as the Xingu is flowing, momentum is building on the campaign. Lula
better watch his back, because the struggle certainly ain't over yet! "

Geneva, Switzerland ",Top financial institutions invest over US$43 billion in producers of cluster bombs,ASN Bank ,Netherlands,,,,"
Almost a year and a half after the historic signing of the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) in Oslo in December 2008, 146 financial institutions from 15 countries around the world still provide over US$ 43 billion worth of investments and financial services to seven producers of cluster bombs. These are the updated findings of the most comprehensive report to date on global financial investments in these banned weapons,‘Worldwide investments in cluster munitions; A shared responsibility , released today in Geneva. Campaigners around the world are now calling on regulators and financial institutions to disinvest from producers of these banned weapons.
""It is unacceptable for leading financial institutions to continue investing in weapons which will be banned under international law and which continue to kill and maim for decades after they are used,"" said Roos Boer, from IKV Pax Christi and one of the report authors. ""These killer weapons are highly stigmatized for the humanitarian harm they cause. It is very disappointing to see that so many leading banks continue to invest in them,"" she added.
The human and economic cost of these weapons is well documented. Like landmines, cluster bombs have killed and injured thousands of civilians during the last 40 years and continue to do so long after a conflict has ended. On August 1st, 2010, the Convention on Cluster Munitions will enter into force and become binding under international law.
Despite this, the world's top financial institutions continue to finance the following seven leading producers of cluster bombs and cluster bomb components: Alliant Techsystems  (USA), Hanwha (South Korea), L-3 Communications (USA), Lockheed Martin (USA) Poongsan (South Korea), Singapore Technologies Engineering (Singapore) and Textron (USA) . Since May 2007, these financial institutions provided:



 
 


 

 
 
 
 
 


Investment banking services worth over US$6,712.15 million
Loans amounting to at least US$3,190.26 million
Owned or managed shares and bonds for at least US$33,116.1 million 


 
 
 
 
The publication by Cluster Munition Coalition members, IKV Pax Christi (the Netherlands) and Netwerk Vlaanderen (Belgium), categorizes retail banks, investment banks, asset management companies and private and public pensions into a ""Hall of Shame,"" a ""Hall of Fame"" and ""runners-up"" category, based on their investment policies and practices. The report also looks at legislative initiatives to prohibit investment in cluster munitions.
Leading in the Hall of Shame for:

Investment banking services to companies producing cluster munitions (in millions): Bank of America (US$ 873.25), JP Morgan Chase (US$ 776.72), Goldman Sachs (US$ 726.32), Deutsche Bank (US$ 512.65), and HSBC (US$ 447.33) provided the largest amount of investment banking services since May 2007.
Loans to companies producing cluster munitions (in millions): Bank of America (US$ 436.25), Citigroup (US$ 321.25), Goldman Sachs (US$ 250), Credit Agricole CIB (US$155) and Barclays (US$154.38) provided the largest amounts of loans since May 2007.
 Asset management: State Street, Capital Group, BlackRock, Temasek Holdings and Vanguard Group provided the largest asset management services based on their portfolio by the winter of 2009-2010. The involvement of Temasek Holdings is solely due to its major holding of 50.31% of the shares of Singapore Technologies Engineering.

Of the 146 financial institutions in the Hall of Shame, 102 are from countries that have not (yet) signed the CCM, and over half are from the United States. Sixteen are based in four countries that have signed and ratified the CCM (France, Germany, Japan and Spain) and 28 are from countries that have signed but not yet ratified the CCM. Thirty-two financial institutions investing in producers of cluster munitions are from the European Union, and 31 of these financial institutions are from countries that have signed the CCM. 
""It is time to stop the double standard - countries should adopt policies to prevent these investments and financial institutions should disinvest from these banned weapons,"" said Esther Vandenbroucke, of Netwerk Vlaanderen and one of the report authors. ""We praise the governments and financial institutions which have taken clear steps to stop investments in these killer weapons and we will be campaigning for others to do the same,"" she concluded.
The Hall of Fame includes: Twenty-one financial institutions  with strong policies, which are all from countries which have signed the CCM. These include five government managed pension funds from Norway, Ireland, New Zealand and Sweden, three ethical banks and 13 private institutions. The research shows that strong government policies help. The Norwegian Pension Fund has excluded producers of cluster munitions since 2004.
The Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) enters into force on August 1st, 2010, when over 100 countries around the world will be forbidden under international law, to produce, use, stockpile or transfer these banned weapons, as well as to assist others to do so. Although the CCM does not explicitly prohibit financial investments, it can be interpreted as a form of ""assistance"", which is prohibited under Article 1C of the Convention.
Activists will use this new information to strengthen their campaigning efforts which name and shame financial institutions who continue to invest in cluster bomb producers and to praise and support those who disinvest.

Notes to the editor:
 The first report by IKV Pax Christi and Netwerk Vlaanderen on ‘Worldwide investments in cluster munitions; A shared responsibility was published in London, in October 2009. The first report listed investments found from January 1, 2007 until August 1, 2009. This update lists investments found between 1 May, 2007 and 28 February, 2010. For asset management, the portfolio as per March 2010 is included.
 One of the sectors that these companies is active in is the production of weapons and munitions, which include cluster bombs. We regard a company as a producer, regardless of the nature and size of any of its other activities.               
 The Dutch research company Profundo conducted the research on the financial links in this report.
 As of this update, within the European Union, 20 out of the 27 European Union member countries have signed the CCM, and 10 EU member countries have ratified the CCM.

 Triodos Bank (the Netherlands), ABP (the Netherlands), AP1 - 4 (Sweden), AP7 (Sweden), ASN Bank (the Netherlands), ATP (Denmark), Banca Etica (Italy), BPF Bouw (the Netherlands), DnB NOR, (Norway), Ethias (Belgium), KLP (Norway), KPA (Sweden), Norwegian Government Pension Fund - Global (Norway)}, National Pensions Reserve Fund (Ireland), NZ SuperannuationFund (New Zealand), PGGM (the Netherlands), Philips Pension Fund (the Netherlands), PME (the Netherlands), PNO Media (the Netherlands), Spoorwegpensioenfonds (the Netherlands), Storebrand (Norway), Triodos Bank (the Netherlands).  
State laws against investments
The Convention on Cluster
Munitions has been signed by 104 countries and 30 countries have already ratified
it. The Convention will enter into force on 1 August 2010.
In addition, Belgium, Ireland,
Luxembourg and New Zealand
have already made it illegal under domestic law to invest in cluster munitions
producers. Other states like Lebanon
have already stated that they see investment as one of the prohibited forms of
assistance in the Convention on Cluster Munitions. More countries are expected
to follow suit.
Where are the finance companies based?
US based financial institutions
make up for more than 50% percent of the financial institutions included in the
Hall of Shame.
Forty four of the 146 financial
institutions are from countries that have signed the CCM including thirty one
from European Union member countries. At the time of writing the report, 20 out
of the 27 EU member countries had signed the CCM, and eight EU member countries
had ratified the CCM.

About cluster bombs 
A cluster munition (or cluster
bomb) is a weapon containing multiple - often hundreds - of small explosive sub
munitions or bomblets. Cluster munitions are dropped from the air or fired from
the ground and designed to break open in mid-air, releasing the sub munitions
over an area that can be the size of several football fields. This means they
cannot discriminate between civilians and soldiers. Many of the sub munitions
fail to explode on impact and remain a threat to lives and livelihoods for
decades after a conflict.  
About the Convention on Cluster Munitions 
The Convention on Cluster
Munitions (CCM) bans the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of cluster
munitions and requires countries to clear affected areas within 10 years and
destroy stockpiles of the weapon within eight. The CCM includes groundbreaking
provisions requiring assistance to victims and affected communities. Opened for
signature in Oslo
in December 2008, it is the most significant international disarmament treaty
since the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty banning antipersonnel landmines.

Anchorage, Alaska ",Jewelry retail giant Zale Corp. and twelve other firms pledge to protect Alaska’s Bristol Bay,,,Pebble gold-copper mine ,mining - non coal,United States,"
A wave of new jewelry retailers, including the nation’s 2nd largest jewelry retailer, Zale Corporation (NYSE: ZLC), pledged support today for permanently protecting Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed from large-scale metal mining, including the controversial proposed Pebble Mine.
""The 1,850 Bristol Bay commercial fishing permit holders that we represent want to thank the jewelers who have vowed not to buy gold from the Pebble Mine,"" said Bob Waldrop, Bristol Bay Regional Seafood Development Association. “This landslide of new jeweler support is a tremendous boost to our efforts to protect this irreplaceable fishery.""
The twelve new jewelers, which represent over $US 2 billion in sales in the United States, include retail giant Zale Corp. and independent jewelers Toby Pomeroy, Blair Lauren Brown, Reflective Images, Michaels Jewelers, Security Jewelers, Ingle & Rhode, Alberto Parada, Real Jewels, CRED Jewellery, Open Source Minerals, and Fair Trade in Gems and Jewelry.
“Zale is committed to sourcing gold and other precious metals in a responsible manner. We believe gold should be mined and refined in a manner that protects both the environment and its inhabitants. Therefore, Zale is happy to support, alongside other jewelers, the pledge to protect the Bristol Bay Fishery Reserve from large-scale metals mining,” said Gil Hollander, Executive Vice President of Zale Corporation, which has 1,930 stores in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico.
These jewelers have taken this extraordinary step at the invitation of local Alaskans, who want to protect Bristol Bay's salmon fishery -- the world's largest remaining wild sockeye salmon fishery and the source of roughly 50 percent of the world's commercial supply of sockeye salmon.
“Bristol Bay is a treasure, a jewel in our safekeeping. As we would never think of gambling with our children’s well-being, it is also our responsibility to never let risk or harm befall this rare and beautiful natural treasure,” said jewelry designer Toby Pomeroy. The jewelers join twenty other prominent retailers, including Tiffany & Co., Birks & Mayors, and class ring firm Jostens, who have already vowed not to buy gold from the Pebble mine. The mine proposed at the headwaters of Bristol Bay is projected to be the largest in North America, generating billions of tons of mine waste and industrializing important salmon habitat in the heart of the world’s last great wild sockeye salmon fishery. London-based mining giant Anglo American and Vancouver-based Northern Dynasty are partners in the project. The two companies recently announced plans to invest another $US 73 million into the project this year, with plans to submit mine permit applications in 2011.
Because jewelry represents over 80 percent of gold demand globally, retailers are an important and emerging voice against the controversial mine. Altogether the jewelers that have signed the pledge represent a total of over $US 6 billion in annual sales. ""The customer is always right, and we expect smart suppliers like Anglo American and Northern Dynasty to listen to their customers. These leading jewelers are just saying ‘no’ to gold from harmful mining in Bristol Bay."" said Bonnie Gestring of Earthworks. ""These jewelers know that shoppers in their stores care that the gold that they purchase doesn't come at the expense of international treasures like Bristol Bay,"" she said.
More than 60 jewelry retailers and manufacturers have signed on to principles for responsible gold sourcing, as part of EARTHWORKS’ No Dirty Gold campaign.

Bangkok ","Laos hydropower project deprives villagers of water, food, income",,,Nam Theun 2 dam ,energy plants - dams,Laos,"
Back in November, I visited Navan Tai village on the Xe Bang Fai River in Laos. The morning sun shone down on a bustle of activity. The surface was scattered with small fishing boats as people cast nets into the sparkling waters. Women and children were bathing, while a couple of 
young boys showed off daring dives.
Last month I returned, but the morning scene had completely changed. There were no fishing boats to be seen. The riverbank was underwater and nobody was bathing.
Locals told me the water level had increased by 2.5 metres over the past two days. Why? Because on March 15, the Nam Theun 2 Hydropower Project began full operations for the first time.
The power-generation scheme has been launched in violation of legal obligations to provide compensation and livelihood support to affected communities. The Xe Bang Fai River is particularly impacted because the project is diverting six Olympic swimming pools of water per minute into the river.
More than 120,000 people living along the river will be affected by Nam Theun 2. Already it is blocking villagers' access to clean water and destroying essential food sources, including fisheries and riverbank vegetable gardens, without appropriate compensation. The villagers are 
also concerned about more severe flooding and riverbank erosion caused by water released from the dam.
The Nam Theun 2 Power Company has warned communities not to drink the river water because it is contaminated. Yet replacement wells are not functioning, nor is the groundwater suitable for domestic consumption. The water colour has changed to brown and many villagers have little 
choice but to continue using water from the river.
""The company promised to find a solution for drinking water years ago, but there is no solution yet,"" a resident of Boeung Xe village told me.
NO COMPENSATION
Riverbank gardens are a major source of income and food for most of the riparian villagers. In March, I could not find one person in the four villages I visited who had been compensated yet for their flooded riverbank gardens, although the World Bank's resettlement policy says no
land should be taken before compensation is paid.
What's more, serious erosion has been occurring downstream along the Xe Bang Fai River as a result of the fluctuating water levels since December, when the power company began test operations. Once again, no compensation has been paid for the riverbank gardens that were washed away.
The villagers - many of whom rely on fishing for food and income - also told me fish had disappeared from the river since the dam started operating. In the peak season in May and June, a fisherman in Navan Tai Village can expect to catch about 40-50 kg of fish per day, earning $100-$150. But each household is entitled to only $100-$250 in compensation for fishery and other losses that may last a lifetime.
Villagers are also worried about more frequent, deeper and longer-lasting floods. One resident of Boeung Xe told me: ""We are seriously concerned that water released from the dam will cause more severe flooding of our rice fields and tobacco gardens. In the beginning, the company said they would build the infrastructure to avoid floods. But now they have said they don't have money to protect the river banks.""
The World Bank stated on March 24 that a comprehensive compensation and mitigation program has been under implementation for several years, and the project has robust monitoring through which its impacts and progress are being tracked.
But if that is true, why do the villagers say they have not been compensated, and why are they so concerned about the future?
The World Bank, Asian Development Bank and other project funders promised that the Lao people would be better off as a result of Nam Theun 2. The results to date are not encouraging.
If the project's backers are serious about ensuring its success, funding needs to be increased dramatically for the downstream compensation programme and support to develop alternative livelihoods must be rapidly scaled up.
Construction on Nam Theun 2 may have been completed, but the work of rebuilding local people's lives has only just begun. "

Brussels/London ",European commission draft document paves way for oil from tar sands in Europe,,, tar sands ,oil and gas,Congo,"
A new
initiative allowing citizens across Europe to express concerns over oil
industry investment in tar sands was launched today amid warnings that the
European Commission is set to sabotage its own efforts to limit the climate
change impacts of the fossil fuel industry.
Drafts of the
Fuel Quality Directive implementation plan  - the EU initiative aimed at
reducing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels seen by Friends of the
Earth Europe suggest that the plan will not help to decarbonise the fossil fuel
sector, and will do nothing to restrict imports of oil from tar sands to Europe. Oil produced from tar sands produces up to five
times more greenhouse gas emissions than conventional oil.
Friends of
the Earth Europe together with other environment groups has written to climate
action commissioner Connie Hedegaard urging her to address the weaknesses in
the draft. 
Darek
Urbaniak, extractive industries campaigner for Friends of the Earth Europe
said: ""European oil companies are already significantly increasing their tar
sands portfolios through investments in Congo,
Jordan, Madagascar, Nigeria,
Russia
and other countries. The Fuel Quality Directive is supposed to benefit the
climate but the latest proposal from the European Commission leaves the
European market wide open for fuels produced from tar sands and undermines the
whole purpose of the legislation. The EU should be leading the world in
stopping tar sands.""
Major oil
companies have been pushing for the removal of greenhouse gas reduction targets
for fossil fuels they produce in this legislation allowing them to continue to
invest in the extraction of oil from tar sands.
Now they are
coming under pressure from anti-tar sands campaigners and concerned investors
who have succeeded in filing a resolution  to the forthcoming Annual General
Meetings of BP plc and Royal Dutch Shell plc, calling on the companies to
disclose the risks associated with their tar sands investments and their plans
to address them.
From today European pension providers are also
being targeted by the campaign and citizens across Europe
have the opportunity to send a message to BP and Shell investors asking them to
support the resolution on tar sands. The campaign can be found at
www.countingthecost.org.uk
The
resolutions are already supported by a number of major investors in the UK and the United States.
Duncan Exley,
Director of Campaigns for FairPensions, said: ""The resolutions to BP and Shell
were filed amid growing questions from investors, analysts and environmental
groups about the financial, environmental and social implications of tar sands.
We are calling on people to use the power of their pension or savings to force
a review of this damaging and risky activity.""
Tar sands - a naturally
occurring mixture of sand or clay, water and an extremely dense and viscous
form of petroleum called bitumen - cause more damage to the climate than
conventional oil. The greenhouse gas emissions of converting tar sands into
fuel is three to five times higher than for conventional oil. The pollution,
deforestation and wildlife disturbance associated with tar sands developments
also threaten the traditional livelihoods and wellbeing of indigenous communities.

Laos ",Laos’ Nam Theun 2 dam operation illegal,ANZ ,Australia,Nam Theun 2 dam ,energy plants - dams,Laos,"
Laos' largest and most
controversial hydropower project, Nam Theun 2,
began full operation last week in violation of legal obligations to provide
compensation and livelihood restoration to affected communities. In an attempt
to avoid its obligations, the Nam Theun 2 Power Company (NTPC) called last
week's commencement of power production ""commercial export"" of electricity
rather than ""commercial operation"" which would require compliance with
Concession Agreement provisions.
Nam
Theun 2 is being financed by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and a
host of other public and private financial institutions like the Equator
Principle banks ANZ,
BNP Paribas,
KBC, ING group, Bank
of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Crédit
Agricole CIB, and Société
Générale. These institutions have maintained their support for the project
despite violations of their policies and the project's Concession Agreement.
For example, last week's commercial operation started before resettled communities
received irrigated land and before downstream communities received compensation
for flooded gardens and alternative water supply sources, to which they are
legally entitled.
Ikuko
Matsumoto, Lao Program Director of International Rivers, said, ""The Nam Theun 2
Power Company is operating the dam without complying with its 
Concession Agreement. The project is violating people's
human rights by preventing access to clean water and by destroying critical
food sources without providing compensation.""
On the Nakai Plateau,
where 6,200 people have been resettled to make way for the reservoir, villagers
have not been provided with irrigation systems in violation of legal
commitments made in the project's Concession Agreement.
The project is also affecting around 120,000 people
living downstream along the Xe Bang Fai River. Since the project started full
operation, the water level of the upper Xe Bang Fai River has increased by 3.6
meters, as noted during International Rivers' visit to the area. The power
company has warned communities living along the Xe Bang Fai not to drink the
river water because it is contaminated. However, replacement groundwater pumps
provided to communities are not functioning or the groundwater is unsuitable
for domestic consumption. Last week, only two groundwater pumps
out of seven were working in Navan Tai Village,
and in Mahaxai Tai Village
only two pumps were working. Villagers in Boueng Xe Village were told that the groundwater
contained elevated levels of iron making it unsuitable for human consumption.
In addition, riverbank vegetable gardens along the
Xe Bang Fai have been flooded by the rising river, but communities have not yet
received compensation, in violation of World Bank policy.
Moreover, serious erosion has been occurring
downstream along the Xe Bang Fai River as a result of the fluctuating water
levels since December 2009 when NTPC began test operations. No compensation for
the riverbank gardens that were washed away has been paid to the villagers.
Matsumoto
says, ""As funders of Nam Theun 2, the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank,
the European Investment Bank and the Equator Principles Banks have an obligation
to ensure that their requirements are upheld and that promises to Lao villagers
are kept. Dam operation should be suspended until the Nam Theun 2 Power Company
complies with its legal agreements.""

London ",UK and North America groups slam British ‘tar sands’ bank opening in Calgary,Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS)  ,United Kingdom, tar sands ,oil and gas,Congo,"
Environmental and anti-poverty groups in the UK have reacted angrily to the Royal Bank of Scotland opening an ‘oil and gas advisory'
office in Calgary.
 RBS, which is 84% owned by the UK public has been the subject of
controversy in the UK over its record of being the UK bank most heavily
involved in financing fossil fuel projects and companies around the world.
Yesterday, a parliamentary transcript of the
questioning was published showing that officials from the company created by
the government to over see the bailed out banks, UK Financial Investments, had
been vigorously questioned by MPs in a Select Committee hearing over whether or
not RBS had been using public money to finance tar sands in Canada.
Speaking after the hearing, Martin Horwood, MP for Cheltenham and Environmental Audit Committee member,
said:  ""The Government must stop RBS
using our money to drive the most damaging projects on earth. RBS is using
taxpayer's money to finance projects and companies that are driving climate
change all over the world. These projects include tar sands extraction in Canada that is
trampling on the rights of indigenous communities and destroying pristine
wilderness.""
The hearing took place on the same day that questions
were being asked in Parliament, RBS announced it was opening an office in Calgary
that it said it would be an be an extension of its Houston practice and its oil
and gas advisory in the United States.
Kevin Smith, from PLATFORM, co-author of the recently
published ‘Cashing
in on Tar Sands' report said:  ""RBS
is positioning itself to cash in on Albertan tar sands. MPs are asking
questions about RBS using public money like this because UK citizens
would be horrified to learn that their taxes are being used to facilitate the
expansion of projects that cause such widespread ecological devastation against
the wishes of First Nation communities.""
Protests over RBS' involvement in tar sands financing
are being planned by the World Development Movement and People & Planet to
take place across the UK,
including at RBS' Annual General Meeting that will take place on the 28th of April in Edinburgh.
Deborah Doane from the World Development Movement
said: ""We are planning protests up and down the UK because so much of our money is
being used to provide finance for unsustainable tar sands extraction. These
investments have a devastating impact on the lives of Indigenous communities in
Canada,
and are fuelling climate change, just to service the rich world's unquenchable
thirst for dirty energy. The RBS decision to open a new office in Calgary to
target the Albertan oil and gas market is yet more confirmation that our money
is not being put where it should: towards socially useful and low carbon
projects.""
Clayton Thomas-Muller from the Indigenous
Environmental Network said: ""The concerns of First Nations peoples should not
be taken lightly by RBS. Working with our partners in the UK, we will highlight how RBS is morally
bankrupt in profiteering off the most destructive project on earth when we
bring the tar sands issue to their shareholder meeting in April in Scotland.""
 
 
NOTES
 
 The announcement was made in the Calgary Herald on
10 March 2010. See here.
 In February 2010, the report ‘Cashing in on Tar
Sands - RBS, UK Banks and Canada's ‘Blood oil'' showed that RBS was the UK bank
most heavily involved in underwriting corporate loans to companies involved in
tar sands extraction. See here and here.
 The Environmental Audit Committee hearing took
place on 10 March 2010 in the House of Commons. The committee questioned Mr
Robin Budenberg, Chief Executive and Mr Sam Woods, Chief Operating Officer, UK
Financial Investments, the company set up to manage the public stake in
recapitalized banks such as RBS and Mrs Lowri Khan, Director, Financial
Stability, Mr Chris Martin, Director, Public Services and Environment and Mr

Nijmegen, The Netherlands ","Equator Principles: Action, not words needed",ABN AMRO ,Netherlands,,,,"
BankTrack, the
international NGO network monitoring commercial bank operations, today welcomes
the take over by Citi of the chair of the steering committee of the Equator
Principles. We congratulate Mr. Shawn Miller for taking up this prestigious
role on behalf of Citi.
At the same time,
BankTrack calls upon the new chair to no longer resort to empty slogans and
hollow promises and to get to work on improving the performance of the Equator
Principles on a number of urgent issues that, if left unsolved, threaten the
very credibility of the Equator Principles as a sustainability initiative that
delivers.
Last month, prior
to the annual engagement with the Equator Principles Financial Institutions
(EPFIs) in Zürich, Switzerland, BankTrack published an open letter signed by
over a hundred civil society organizations, demanding ‘bold steps forward' with
the Equator Principles. Specifically, the letter called upon the EPFIs to:

Open
     up, by improving the transparency of the
     Principles through full disclosure of banks' implementation efforts, on
     the project level, disclosure of all information related to a project's
     social and environmental impact.
Be
     accountable, by improving the community
     consultation process, establishing guidelines for project grievance
     mechanisms, and establishing an accountability mechanism for the
     Principles themselves.
Expand
     the scope, by committing to apply the
     Principles, or an adapted version thereof, beyond project finance
     transactions to general corporate loans, asset management activities and
     Initial Public Offerings (IPOs).
Stop
     financing climate change, by developing
     exclusion criteria for projects and activities with a high impact on
     climate change, such as fossil fuel exploration projects and coal power
     plants, and by developing stringent climate targets for other projects
     financed ‘under Equator'.

As the EPFIs, during
the meeting in Zürich failed to seriously respond to the extensive proposals of
civil society contained in the letter, BankTrack felt obliged to end the seven
year engagement process with the Equator Principles banks. Talks will be
resumed only after EPFIs publicly disclose what steps they intend to make on the
issues listed above. 
""Citi may look
forward to partnering with the EPFI colleagues"", says Michelle Chan, Program
Director, Green Investments Friends of the Earth US, referring to the
announcement made by Citi, ""but the people to start partnering with are first
and foremost communities affected by projects financed ‘under Equator'. After
seven years, their voice continues to be largely ignored by the EPFIs""
""The new chair begins
his term by saying that ‘the Equator Principles enormous success in what is
relatively a short-period of time is truly remarkable' , says Johan Frijns,
BankTrack's international coordinator, ""but in fact there is almost no independently
verifiable evidence coming from banks that the Principles indeed make a positive
difference for project affected communities, or help preserve the environment.
In contrast, we are aware of numerous serious problems with projects that are
‘under Equator'.  It is precisely this self-congratulatory attitude,
combined with a continuous lack of transparency and accountability that may
eventually defeat the Equator Principles initiative"".

Europe ",Europe-wide protests against Turkish banks,Akbank ,Turkey,Ilisu dam ,energy plants - dams,Turkey,"
Today, following the
‘International Day of Action Against Dams, for Rivers and Livelihoods',
environmental and human rights activists are staging protests in nine European
cities against loan commitments by two Turkish banks for the controversial
Ilisu dam project. With vigils in front of Garantibank and Akbank offices and
other rallies they demand the banks' immediate withdrawal from the controversial
project in the Kurdish Southeast of Turkey.
The construction of the Ilisu dam on the Tigris river would lead to
massive environmental destruction and inundation of invaluable cultural
heritage, including the 12,000 year old town of Hasankeyf. No resettlement land is available
for the ten thousands of people that will be affected by the dam. The project
also severely disrupts water flows to neighbouring countries Iraq and Syria, which have not been
consulted in accordance with international law.
""On the International Day of Action Against Dams, we celebrate
free-flowing rivers which give life to animals, plants and humans"", explains
Heike Drillisch, coordinator of the German network CounterCurrent. ""The Tigris river is still a precious ecosystem which sustains
the livelihood of many people. Once constructed, up to 85,000 people will see
their land drowned by the Ilisu dam reservoir. In addition to this, the dam
threatens the survival of endangered species such as the Euphrates
soft-shell turtle. Who can bear this responsibility?""
""The cultural heritage that would be drowned is of utmost significance
for the population in the region as well as for humankind as a whole"", states Anna
Irvin from the Kurdish Human Rights Project.
In Summer 2009, the governments of Germany,
Austria and Switzerland
terminated their guarantees for this highly contested project, immediately
followed by a withdrawal from the project by the European banks Société
Générale, UniCredit and DekaBank. Despite this withdrawal, the Turkish
government pledged to continue the project.
In January 2010, Akbank and Garantibank pledged funding for the
construction of the dam, making them the main target of today's protests as
well as a string of actions prepared for the next weeks.
""In Turkey, AkBank and GarantiBank both claim to be committed to social
and environmental sustainability. But such a commitment is meaningless if it
has no consequences for the sort of projects a bank decides to finance"" says
Johan Frijns, coordinator of the BankTrack network.""The Ilisu dam is one of
those dodgy projects that can never be made ‘sustainable' and no bank should be
involved in it"" 
""The well-being of the people, the nature and culture of the Tigris river must be sacrificed for the sake of private
banks"", demands Ercan Ayboga, European spokesperson from the Initiative to Keep
Hasankeyf Alive. ""The banks' decision to provide finance for the Ilisu project flies
in the face of their environmental and social commitments. Without their loans
the Turkish government will not be able to start the Ilisu project in the next
years"", says Ercan Ayboga.
Protests are taking place in front of the European branches of Akbank
and Garantibank in Amsterdam, London,
Frankfurt, Essen and Hannover.
Additional protests are staged in Berlin, Zurich and Strasbourg as
well as in front of the Austrian construction company Strabag in Vienna, which is involved in dam projects on the Munzur
river in Turkey.
""The construction of the Konaktepe I+II and other dam projects on the
Munzur River does not make any economic sense. A natural paradise, the specific
Kurdish-alevi culture of the Munzur region and billions of Euros are sacrificed
to produce 1 percent of Turkey's
energy needs"", explains Kiymet Ceviz from the newly founded Free Munzur
Initiative in Europe. ""We appeal to Strabag to
immediately withdraw from these dam projects.""
Background: 
The ‘International Day of Action Against Dams, for Rivers and
Livelihoods' is held for the 13th time on March 14th. Dam opponents in over 20
countries protest dam projects with a wide range of activities (see
www.internationalrivers.org). In Turkey, a coalition of 20 dam critical
movements have organized demonstrations and meeting against the Ilısu,
Konaktepe I+II and many other destructive dams (see www.akarsuhareketleri.org).
European campaigners followed on Monday, March 15th, as banks were
closed on the original day of action.

Washington DC ",Civil society organizations demand reform of World Bank Group lending to private corporations,,,,,,"
Today, nearly 100 civil society
organizations from 38 countries are demanding that World Bank Group lending to
private corporations be much more responsive to environmental and social
concerns.  A letter submitted to the
director of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), Lars Thunell,
describes that IFC's lack of transparency and supervision, failure to recognize
human rights, and inadequate climate change policies, undermine IFC's ability
to achieve its poverty alleviation mission. 
""IFC is becoming more like a
commercial bank, but failing to incorporate lessons learned from the financial
crisis in its lending practices. Standards for its clients are less clear,
monitoring and supervision reduced, and development outcomes questionable.  This is not how public money should be spent,""
said Anne Perrault of the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL), a
Washington D.C.-based legal advocacy organization.
IFC, which committed over USD 12
billion in financing to the private sector in 2009, is reviewing the
implementation and effectiveness of its Social and Environmental Sustainability
Policy and Performance Standards. These Performance Standards, in turn, set the
bar for 67 private banks (the Equator Principles Financial Institutions)
involved in development project finance and many Export Credit Agencies. 
""With its role as a global
standard-setter, IFC should be raising the bar in terms of social and
environmental responsibility for private development finance-but it is,
instead, letting its own standards slide, resulting in water and air pollution
and families being left without adequate homes or means to earn a living,"" said
Joanna Levitt from the International Accountability Project in San Francisco.
The civil society letter points to
a number of cases in which IFC-investments have had devastating impacts on
local populations.
""For the last ten years we
have been suffering from an epidemic of chronic renal insufficiency. Day after
day we see our friends die,"" said Ezequiel Ramirez Salgado, President of
the ASOCHIVIDA, an association of ex-sugarcane workers in Nicaragua who
filed a complaint with the IFC's Compliance Advisor Ombudsman regarding a loan
to a Nicaraguan sugar company. 
""Instead of helping us get better medical care, the World Bank 
gave a loan to the biggest corporation in Central America,
Grupo Pellas.""
The 18-page civil society letter
indicates that international human rights standards, including those reflected
in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, must be incorporated
into the Policy and Performance Standards. Perrault notes ""IFC cannot achieve
its mission to reduce poverty without focused attention to human rights.  Explicit recognition of international human
rights standards, including those reflected in the UN Declaration on the Rights
on Indigenous Peoples, provides the most effective approach to doing this.""
In the letter, civil society
organizations also highlight the impact of IFC operations on greenhouse gas
emissions. The letter calls on IFC to phase-out support for fossil-fuels, in
line with the World Bank's own findings on the extractive industries sectors
and commitments made by the G-20 at last year's summit in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
""In order to trigger a portfolio
shift towards low carbon technologies, IFC should make clear commitments to
reduce total emissions according to a set timetable,"" said Antonio Tricarico of
the Italian-based Campaign to Reform the World Bank . ""A new reduction commitment might represent the most
important short-term contribution of the World Bank Group to tackling the
climate emergency.""

society letter addressed to Lars Thunell, Executive Vice President of the

 Sixty-seven financial
institutions from twenty-seven countries have adopted the Equator Principles
(EP). The EPs are a voluntary set of standards, based on IFC's sustainability
framework, for determining, assessing and managing social and environmental
risk in project financing. These private sector financial institutions operate
in over 100 countries. As a result, the Equator Principles have become the
project finance industry standard for addressing environmental and social
issues in project financing globally.

San Fransisco ",Suit launched to challenge federal financing of foreign fossil fuel project,,,,,,"
The Center for Biological Diversity, Pacific Environment, and Turtle Island Restoration Network have notified the U.S. Export Import Bank of their intent to sue the federal agency for financing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Papua New Guinea without analyzing the project's environmental impacts.
""If we are going to address global warming, the United States needs to stop funding new fossil fuel projects,"" said Miyoko Sakashita, oceans director at the Center for Biological Diversity. ""Instead, taxpayer dollars are financing an immense natural-gas project with adverse impacts on wildlife and habitat.""
The Export Import Bank approved $3 billion to ExxonMobil and partners to develop an LNG project in Papua New Guinea - the largest transaction in the bank's 75-year history. Shortly after pledging to reduce fossil fuel subsidies at the G20 conference in 2009, the Obama administration gave this record-breaking LNG funding. Today, President Obama will address the Export Import Bank's annual conference.
""Export Import Bank's $3 billion subsidy to ExxonMobil runs afoul of climate change concerns, and will also cause damage through illegal harm to endangered wildlife,"" said Doug Norlen, policy director at Pacific Environment. ""This ecological damage adds to other local impacts including growing human rights concerns.""
Today's notice challenges the Export Import Bank's failure to analyze the impacts of its project on endangered wildlife in violation of the U.S. Endangered Species Act. The LNG project will be the largest industrial development in Papua New Guinea producing natural gas for overseas markets. The development will cut through rainforest, mangrove, and coral-reef habitat with harmful impacts on biodiversity, including endangered sea turtles and marine mammals. Also, the project will produce than 3 million tons of CO2 every year in direct emissions.
""The leatherback sea turtles at risk from this LNG project in Papua New Guinea are critically endangered, and they are the same turtles that migrate thousands of miles to forage in the waters off the U.S. West Coast,"" said Teri Shore, program director for Turtle Island Restoration Network. ""Sea turtles risk losing important habitat and also being struck and killed by vessels shipping fossil fuels overseas.""
Export Import Bank has 60 days to correct the violations described in today's notice letter before the conservation groups may file suit in federal court. "

London ",UK Taxpayers' money involved in financing controversial tar sands companies,Barclays ,United Kingdom,Canadian tar sands ,oil and gas,Canada,"

New report exposes
     RBS involvement in Canada's
     ""blood oil""
Bank executives
     meet in Toronto
     and discuss concerns about public backlash over involvement in tar sands 
Environmental and
     development groups announce a week of protest around the RBS AGM in April
     over the bank's tar sands investments

It's been revealed that RBS has been involved in
providing loans worth $7.5 billion in the last three years to companies
carrying out highly controversial ‘tar sands' mining  in Canada.
A coalition of NGOs including PLATFORM, the World
Development Movement, People & Planet and Friends of the Earth  are today
releasing a report, 'Cashing
in on Tar Sands - RBS, UK Banks and Canada's ‘Blood Oil' which shows that outside
of North America, RBS is involved in the highest quantity of loans to tar
sands-related companies, equivalent to 8 per cent of the global total.
Exploitation of tar sands has been the subject of
international criticism for its negative impact on climate change, Canadian
ecosystems and the Indigenous communities that live in the region. On the 1st of February, executives of European and North American banks, including RBS,
met in Toronto
to discuss concerns over a public backlash over the banking sector's
involvement in the increasingly controversial projects. 
The report is being released on Monday, the day three
of the groups are in court challenging the Treasury over RBS' use of public
money to provide finance for companies that exacerbate climate change and
disregard human rights, including tar sands, coal, oil and gas and other forms of
mining, for examples Vedanta's bauxite mines in India.
Mel Evans from PLATFORM, one of the authors of the
report said: ""RBS has been involved in providing more money in loans to
destructive tar sands companies than any other UK bank. When RBS executives get
their bonuses, they are being rewarded for enabling oil companies to devastate
traditional ways of life for Indigenous communities in Canada, while
making the problems of climate change much, much worse.""
Clayton Thomas-Muller, an Indigenous activist from Canada said: """"RBS must publicly commit to not
providing finance to Canada's
tar sands. Failure to do so would be morally bankrupt given that the
developments entail massive ecological destruction and human rights abuses
particularly in First Nations Lands. Now that RBS is owned by the public, the
bank should be transformed into a leader in the emerging green energy economy in
the UK rather than causing
so much destruction to the lands of Indigenous Peoples in Canada.""
The World Development Movement and People &
Planet are today announcing a week of protests to be held simultaneously with
the RBS AGM on Wednesday 28 April. This will involve protests outside the AGM
centre and branches across the UK
calling for a moratorium on RBS investments in tar sands because of their
devastating impact on human rights and the climate.
Deborah Doane, director of the World Development
Movement said: ""It's deeply concerning to learn that so much of our money
is being used to provide finance for tar sands extraction. These investments
have a devastating impact on the lives of Indigenous communities in Canada,
while fuelling climate change, just to service the rich world's unquenchable
thirsty for dirty energy.  The
consequences of climate change are already hitting the world's poorest people
the hardest, and this completely cancels out efforts we take nationally to
prevent catastrophic climate change. This is a huge injustice and during our
week of protest we will be demanding that investment of our money into this
'blood oil' be stopped immediately.""
The report can be downloaded here.
 
 Tar sands are a type of oil that is mixed up
with a particulate matter that needs to separated. The process of obtaining the
oil is around three times more carbon intensive than obtaining conventional
oil. In addition the process creates enormous lakes of toxic byproducts that
are leaking into water sources, and are being blamed by local communities for
the abnormal rates of rare cancers they are experiencing.
 The full list of groups publishing the report
is PLATFORM, the World Development Movement, People & Planet, the
Indigenous Environmental Network, Friends of the Earth - Scotland, Friends of
the Earth - England, Wales and Northern Ireland, Friends of the Earth - Europe,
the New Internationalist, Indigenous Peoples Links, BankTrack and the
Rainforest Action Network
 The meeting was hosted by the Royal Bank of Canada and was held at the RBC
Plaza in Toronto
Canada
and attended by 41 banking executives from around the world, including Baba
Abu, the RBS Head, Sustainable Business, Global Banking. The day included
presentations by Jim Ellis, the Albertan Deputy Minister for the Environment,
and Peter Watson, the Deputy Minister for Energy, and a presentation on ‘Public
Opinion on Canada's
Oil Sands' by Bruce Anderson of National Public Relations.
(3) Investments were scrutinized of 26 banks from
across the world, including Barclays, RBS and HSBC. The report looks at looks
at the finance that RBS, Barclays and HSBC have made to companies that (a) have an ownership
stake in existing tar sands projects and projects under development; or (b)
own, operate or are developing pipelines primarily being used to transport tar
sands oil over a three year period from January 2007 through
to December 2009 and has been collated using a Bloomberg terminal.

Tasmania ",Australian company Gunns' planned restructure vain attempt to avoid real reform,,,Tamar Valley Pulp Mill Tasmania (formerly Gunns Pulp Mill) ,forestry - pulp and paper,Australia,"
Gunns Ltd's proposed restructure of its company in
response to its abysmal financial performance is a vain attempt to hide its
native forest logging operations from scrutiny by potential pulp-mill
investors, according to the Wilderness Society. Gunns, which today announced a
98% drop in profits for the first half of the financial year, plans to isolate
its native-forest logging operations from the pulp mill proposal, plantations
and other more acceptable parts of its operations such as wine-making and
retail outlets.
""Gunns has failed to listen to the public and the
marketplace, both of whom say stop destroying Tasmania's native forests,"" said Paul
Oosting, spokesperson for the Wilderness Society.
Instead of heeding the clear message from
international markets and the public, Gunns is trying to isolate its native
forest logging operations in an internal business structure. This won't help.
What the company really needs to do is to get out of native-forest logging
entirely,"" said Mr Oosting.
""As a first step, Gunns should support the full
protection of Tasmania's
high-conservation-value native forests and pledge a fast transition out of
native forest logging. Anything short of that will see continued community
conflict and opposition to their operations,"" said Mr Oosting.
""Gunns has indicated that it hopes this move will help
secure funds for the pulp mill and its plantation business, but investors will
not be fooled by this window dressing. Any company contemplating joining the
Gunns' pulp mill venture will face stiff opposition whilst Gunns' continues to
destroy Tasmania's
native forests,"" said Mr Oosting.
""Gunns' reluctance to reform its environmentally and
socially destructive logging operations has helped wipe away the value of the
company and its profits and has lead to major job losses in Tasmania.""

London ",28 countries accused of facilitating money laundering … but key offenders missing,Bank of America ,United States,,,,"
 
An international financial crime watchdog has named
and shamed countries that are failing to stop dirty money entering the
financial system, a move welcomed by Global Witness. However, conspicuously
absent are major financial centres and secrecy jurisdictions, many of which
also have serious weaknesses in their anti-money laundering regulations.
The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the
intergovernmental group that sets the global anti-money laundering standard,
has issued a list of countries which are failing to do enough to crack down on
financial crime. The 28 countries include Iran,
Greece and Turkey.
""This list is a welcome move by the FATF and will put
significant pressure on the named countries to take money laundering
seriously,"" said Anthea Lawson, a campaigner with Global Witness. ""However, the
rich countries at the heart of the FATF need to get their own house in order
and ensure that they too are meeting its standards"".
The task force has reverted to type by focusing mostly
on poorer countries, while ignoring the substantial loopholes in the anti-money
laundering systems of many rich jurisdictions. No countries have fully met the
FATF standard, not even the United
  States, which has led the global campaign
against dirty money.
Global Witness has exposed how banks, including Barclays, Citibank, HSBC, and Bank of America, have been
able to do business with corrupt regimes, facilitating corruption and denying
some of the world's poorest people a way out of poverty. A recent report by a U.S. Senate committee detailed how foreign officials and their family
members exploited holes in the anti-money laundering framework to bring
millions of illicit dollars into the U.S.  
The list is based on the latest round of peer reviews
carried by the FATF and its regional bodies. The reviews measured whether
countries had laws on the books, rather than whether those laws are actually
being implemented and enforced effectively. This should be the next stage of
the FATF's reviewing and blacklisting process. 
 
Note to editors: The FATF has named 8 countries as not having
sufficient money laundering regulations in place: Iran,
Angola, North Korea, Ecuador,
Ethiopia, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Sao Tomé and Principe.
The FATF criticised the following 20 countries for deficiencies in their
anti-money laundering regime, while recognising that they had high level
political commitment to improve: Antigua and Barbuda, Azerbaijan, Bolivia,
Greece, Indonesia, Kenya, Morocco, Myanmar, Nepal, Nigeria, Paraguay, Qatar,
Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syria, Trinidad and Tobago, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and
Yemen.

London ",Financial crime watchdog’s chance to show its teeth,,,,,,"
Government officials
meeting in Abu Dhabi
next week will name and shame countries that are failing to crack down on
financial crime. Those named may face political, as well as economic, pressure
to strengthen their anti-money laundering laws. The list will be issued by the
Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the intergovernmental group that sets the
global anti-money laundering standard, after a request made by the G20 at its
April 2009 summit in London.
 
The group will expose
countries that have not properly put in place laws to stop dirty money entering
the financial system. The last time it named and shamed problem countries,
during the late 1990s, those blacklisted acted quickly to improve their laws
and get off the list. No countries are yet fully compliant with all of the
FATF's recommendations.
""Holes in the global
anti-money laundering system continue to allow corrupt politicians - as well as
terrorists, nuclear proliferators and organised criminals - access to the funds
that they need, said Anthea Lawson, a campaigner for Global Witness.
During its plenary meeting
next week the task force will also discuss specific measures it can take to
tackle the laundering of the proceeds of corruption, in answer to another G20
demand.
Global Witness has exposed how banks, including Barclays, Citibank, HSBC, and Bank of
America, have been able to do business with corrupt regimes,
facilitating corruption and denying some of the world's poorest people a way
out of poverty. A recent report by a U.S. Senate committee detailed
how foreign officials and their family members exploited holes in the
anti-money laundering framework to bring millions of illicit dollars into the U.S.
""Banks are still helping
politicians from some of the poorest countries in the world squander money on
lavish lifestyles, while their people continue to live in poverty,"" said Ms
Lawson.
Global Witness is calling
on the FATF to show that it is serious about tackling the laundering of the
proceeds of corruption by:

 Providing
more information to banks on how to avoid corrupt funds. 
 Tackling
the systemic problems with the anti-money laundering standard by: 

1)     Requiring countries to publish details of the
beneficial owner of companies, making it harder for corrupt politicians to hide
their identity and their illicitly-acquired funds behind a corporate veil.
2)     Requiring banks to have full originator and
beneficiary information on wire transfers, before processing the payment

 Developing
a way of measuring whether anti-money laundering laws are effectively enforced.
The FATF has been very successful at getting countries to have anti-money
laundering laws on their books, however, in many cases these laws are not being
used. 

The
FATF plenary will be held from 15 February till 19 February.     "

Vienna ",Announcement for restart of Ilisu project without final decision,Akbank ,Turkey,Ilisu dam ,energy plants - dams,Turkey,"
Yesterday's announcement by Turkish prime minister Erdogan, to restart construction of the Ilisu dam, does not come as a surprise to dam critics. ""All along it has been clear that the missing financing will only delay the project. The decisive factor if 'Ilisu' will be built is 
if the public resistance in Turkey gets so strong that the government ultimately has to give in – and this resistance continues“, said Ulrich Eichelmann from the Stop Ilisu Campaign.
Erdogan announced that the missing funding for the project was now assured. Effectively it appears quite certain that additional credit of 300-350 million Euro will come from the Turkish banks Akbank and Garanti Bank. Even so, these banks have not signed any official contracts yet. 
The withdrawal from the project by European export credit agencies (ECAs) and banks in July 2009 left a financing gap of 400-450 million Euro in total.
In contrast to this, the Chinese ambassador in Ankara declared, that China did not intend to support the Ilisu project. In recent months rumours had appeared repeatedly, that the Chinese ECA  “Sinosure“ could replace the European ECAs and provide the necessary export guarantees.
""It is a long way to the final decision, if “Ilisu“ will be built – also after the 5th such announcement by Mr Erdogan. The resistance against this project continues, and we will ultimately stop it.“, added Mr Eichelmann. "

London ",New legal action over latest RBS bail out,Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS)  ,United Kingdom,,,,"
*    
  Last November's £25 billion cash injection deemed 'unlawful' by
campaigners
*       Treasury's intervention in
bankers' bonuses strengthens campaigners case  Three pressure groups today served the Treasury
with their application to the High Court, challenging last November's decision
to provide a further £25 billion of public money to the Royal Bank of Scotland.  According to the Treasury's guidance, when
determining if and how public money is spent, an assessment of the likely
impact the proposed spending will have on human rights and the environment has
to be completed before the money can be provided. The World Development
Movement, PLATFORM and People & Planet believe that no proper assessment
was undertaken and that the Treasury have failed to adequately calculate the
negative impact of allowing RBS to invest taxpayers' money into harmful
projects.  The same groups took the Treasury to the High
Court last year where one of reasons given by the Treasury for not ensuring
public money invested in RBS is spent in a way consistent with its own
commitments on human rights and climate change is that such a restriction would
be harmful to the ""financial stability"" of the bank. The
Treasury also argued that to use RBS' need for capital as a mechanism by which
the Treasury could impose wider Government policy objectives would be
inappropriate. The campaigners argue this is clearly inconsistent with the
Treasury's position and subsequent intervention over the bonuses awarded by RBS
to its staff.  A condition of RBS receiving the November cash
injection under the Asset Protection Scheme was that it would increase lending
to businesses and home owners and not pay cash bonuses to staff earning over
£39,000. The campaigners say that a similar condition could and should have
been imposed on RBS in relation to their investments in
projects and companies which are harmful to the environment and human rights.
The Treasury's 'hypocrisy' is particularly irresponsible given that RBS is
notorious for providing money to projects and companies which are harmful to
climate change and associated with appalling breaches in human rights. CASE STUDY: Where our money is going? Tullow
Oil in border region of Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo
In January 2009, RBS helped
raise £400 million for the Irish company Tullow Oil, and in March 2009 RBS was
part of a consortium of 14 banks that lent £1.4 billion to Tullow Oil. Tullow
Oil is involved in the exploration and extraction of oil on the border between
Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This area has seen some of
the fiercest fighting in an extractive resource-driven civil war as rival
armies and militias have struggled for control of the land.  Rosa Curling of Leigh Day & Co Solicitors
commented:  ""The assessment completed by the Treasury
fails completely to comply with the mandatory requirements of its own guidance
and its failure to apply a consistent policy by insisting on control over the
payment of bonuses but not over the lending to climate change and human rights
damaging projects is unlawful.""  Deborah Doane, director of the World Development
Movement said:  ""It is difficult to understand why the
Treasury can order RBS to increase its lending to small businesses and home
owners or curb bonuses but believe it would be unlawful for it to tell RBS to
phase out its lending in hugely controversial tar sands, and investing in low
carbon projects instead.  This is hypocrisy on a grand scale.
The Treasury has shown that is has the power, if not the will, to intervene in
RBS' lending for the public good.""  Mel Evans, campaigner at PLATFORM said:  ""This second legal challenge is necessary
because the Treasury has failed the public again: it demonstrated that it could
act in the public interest by reining in city bonuses, but shirked once more
from curbing harmful investments.  RBS is continuing to channel public
money into projects around the world that impact communities, ecosystems and
the climate - the Treasury demonstrated that it is within its power to prevent
this, which is exactly what we're calling on them to do.""  Ian Leggett, director at People & Planet said:  ""For the second time in a year we are
compelled to take the Treasury to court because of the way it is managing the
Royal Bank of Scotland. RBS is the dirtiest bank in the UK. It has a long track
record of financing projects and activities that will increase global carbon
emissions, make climate change more likely and are destroying precious
habitats. The Treasury has the power to require RBS to change - but its
consistent failure to do so indicates a total blind spot in Treasury when it
comes to responsible investment.""  The organisations first launched legal action in
June last year over the initial bail out, after an initial set back when the
High Court blocked permission for Judicial Review, the groups lodged an appeal
at the Court of Appeal, which will be heard on February 19th.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes to editors  Tullow has been the subject of recent controversy
in Uganda over the oil contracts it has signed with the Ugandan government.
Tullow Oil had consistently claimed that its contracts with Kampala were
""the best deals in the world"" for the government, but a review of
Uganda's contracts commissioned by the Norwegian Agency for International
Cooperation (NORAD) in 2008 concluded that the profit-share model adopted
""cannot be regarded as being in accordance with the interests of the host
country"". The 20-year contracts, consistently weak or completely
silent on human rights protection, also include a sweeping ""stabilisation
clause"" - article 19 requires the Ugandan government to compensate the
companies for any future change in the law that affects their profits -
designed to militate against improvements in environmental standards. "

Washington DC ",Senate shines welcome spotlight on U.S. facilitation of corruption,Bank of America ,United States,,,,"
 
A U.S senate subcommittee
hearing this week will expose how foreign politicians have used the services of
American lawyers, bankers, lobbyists and other professionals, to bring millions
of suspect dollars into the country.  
Tomorrow the Senate
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations will question representatives from the
State Department, Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE), and Financial
Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), as well as lawyers, a realtor, and
representatives of financial institutions, on whether U.S. policies to combat foreign corruption are
strong enough and whether the U.S.
anti-money laundering regime needs to be improved.
The Subcommittee will also
release a report giving four examples of how American safeguards against money
laundering and corruption have been circumvented by senior foreign political
figures. Global Witness is particularly interested in the hearing because it
reinforces recent work on corruption and money laundering carried out by the
group.
In November 2009 Global
Witness' report The
Secret Life of a Shopaholic exposed major weaknesses in the
American anti-money laundering regime, particularly the rules on wire
transfers, that are supposed to keep dirty money - whether from corruption,
terrorism or narcotics - out of the financial system. The report revealed that
banks including Wachovia, Bank of America and UBS, allowed Teodorin Obiang, son
of the president of oil-rich Equatorial Guinea,
to bring $75 million into the U.S.
between 2005 and 2007.
In March 2009 Undue
Diligence: How Banks do Business with Corrupt Regimes, named and shamed American, British and
European banks who have done business with corrupt regimes and thus contributed
to poverty in these countries. The report showed how Citibank had enabled
Charles Taylor, the former president of Liberia and now on trial for war
crimes, to use the global financial system to profit from timber sales that
were fuelling conflict.
 ""Corruption and bad
management of natural-resource wealth robs citizens of developing countries of
millions of dollars a year and directly undermines both the benefits of
international aid as well as U.S.
energy and national security interests,"" said Corinna Gilfillan, Head of Global
Witness's U.S.
office. ""The U.S.
government could do much more to prevent this from happening by holding its
banks and companies to account.""
Global Witness is calling
on the U.S.
government to:

 Close
loopholes in the design and implementation of its anti-money laundering laws. 
 Cooperate
with its international partners and the Financial Action Task Force to tighten
loopholes in the global framework to prevent the financial and professional
sectors facilitating corruption 
 Pass
the Energy Security Through Transparency Act, a bi-partisan bill introduced in
the U.S. Senate, which would require all extractive industry companies registered with the SEC to
disclose what they pay governments for extraction of natural resources. This
would helpprevent funds from being stolen in the first place.

Près de trois ans après les premières dénonciations des Amis de la Terre, BNP Paribas vient de terminer le contrat de conseil qui le liait à NEK, la compagnie nationale bulgare. BNP Paribas était en effet chargée de coordonner l’ensemble du financement de la centrale nucléaire de Belene, en Bulgarie. « Malgré toutes nos mises en garde, BNP Paribas avait accordé un prêt de 250 millions d’euros à NEK au printemps 2007. Nous avons dû manifester partout en France et en Europe et envoyer plus de 5 000 courriels pour que BNP Paribas daigne nous recevoir. L’affirmation de BNP Paribas, qui prétendait alors que ce prêt ne servirait que pour les études préliminaires et non la construction, s’est en par la suite révélée fausse ! », rappelle Yann Louvel, chargé de campagne Finance privée aux Amis de la Terre.
« C’est une victoire dont les Amis de la Terre se félicitent mais qui arrive bien tard », poursuit Sébastien Godinot, coordinateur des campagnes aux Amis de la Terre. Malgré cette première confrontation, BNP Paribas a en effet continué de s’impliquer dans le projet en assurant un mandat de conseil pour coordonner l’ensemble du financement de la centrale, obligeant les Amis de la Terre à intervenir à nouveau en Assemblée Générale de BNP Paribas, au printemps 2008. Les risques présentés par le projet étaient pourtant bien identifiés, comme les risques sismiques ou les risques de corruption. Le projet avait déjà été abandonné une première fois par le gouvernement bulgare dans les années 90, avant de renaître de ses cendres dans les années 2000.
« Cette tendance de BNP Paribas à se retrouver impliqué plusieurs fois dans le même projet scandaleux, ou à poursuivre le financement de projets notoirement controversés comme le projet pétrolier et gazier de Sakhaline II, en Russie, est proprement sidérante » dénonce Yann Louvel. Il conclut : « BNP Paribas doit tirer toutes les leçons de cette échec et cesser définitivement de s’impliquer dans ce type de projet nucléaire controversé, que ce soit en finançant directement le projet, en le conseillant, ou en investissant dans les entreprises qui le réalisent ».

Davos, Switzerland ",Royal Bank of Canada wins award for “most environmentally irresponsible company” at Davos,Royal Bank of  (RBC) ,Canada,Canadian tar sands ,oil and gas,Canada,"
It isn't often that Rainforest Action Network heads to Davos for the
opening of the World Economic Forum (WEF). But that's just what our tar sands
campaigner, Brant Olson, is doing. Why? Because as world leaders gather at
Davos today to discuss the year's economic fortunes, one financial institution,
the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), will be singled out for their outstanding
contributions to increasing climate change.
In a ceremony held concurrently to the World Economic Forum, RBC was awarded the
Public Eye Global Award presented by the Berne Declaration and Greenpeace. As a result of our
increasingly successful efforts to highlight RBC's role in financing tar sands
extraction projects, RBC was named the year's most environmentally and socially
irresponsible company.
RAN's Brant Olson is accepting the award for RBC as the bank's
representatives declined to attend the ceremony. As Brant said in a press release earlier today:
""Global banks can
no longer ignore the impact their financing has on the climate, people and the
future of this planet. The Public Eye Award demonstrates the increasing global
concern over the billions of dollars of financing flowing into destructive tar sands
projects, which Royal Bank of Canada
is playing a leading role in. The world is watching RBC.""
RBC is the leading financier of companies extracting oil from the Alberta tar sands. Since
2007, RBC has backed $14.3 billion (USD) in credit to companies operating in the tar sands, and
earned more than $84 million (USD) in underwriting fees. As a result, RBC has enabled the
production of the world's dirtiest oil. Oil extraction from the tar sands generates
three times the CO2 emissions as conventionally extracted oil, which will soon
make Canada
the biggest contributor to global warming.
The Global Public
Eye Award is essentially a shame-on-you-award given to the nastiest corporate
players of the year. The Public Eye Awards are a critical counterpoint to the
annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos. The Public Eye
Awards are held in Davos, Switzerland, on the opening day of
the World Economic Forum (WEF). At this counter-event to the WEF, the
organizers of The Berne Declaration and Greenpeace Switzerland remind companies of
their duty as truthful corporate citizens. Awards are given to multinational
companies that have excelled in irresponsible social and environmental
behavior. The Public Eye Global Award included nominees from three continents,
but this year RBC took the prize for. RBC declined to attend the event.
Mining oil from
tar sands requires churning up huge tracts of ancient boreal forest and
polluting so much clean water with poisonous chemicals that the resulting waste
ponds can be seen from outer space. The health impacts to Alberta's First Nation communities are
severe, with cancer rates up in some communities as much as 400 times its usual
frequency. In addition, communities living near oil refineries face increased
air and water pollution from tar sands oil, which contains 11 times more sulfur
and nickel. "

Nijmegen ",Civil society groups call for bold steps forward with Equator Principles,ABN AMRO ,Netherlands,,,,"

Close to a hundred civil society organisations from more than 25 countries* today sent an open letter to all banks and financial institutions that have adopted the Equator Principles**, calling on them to drastically reform their seven year old initiative.
The letter, called Bold steps forward, towards Equator Principles that deliver to people and the planet', was coordinated by BankTrack, the international NGO network monitoring commercial banks. It was sent prior to a meeting which will take place next month between NGOs and banks that have adopted the Equator Principles.
The letter expresses severe disappointment with the performance and impact of the Equator Principles, considered by many observers as the leading sustainability initiative within the banking sector:
""We see a lack of spirit, of belief in the vast potential of the Principles amongst the very banks that have adopted them. We witness an inward looking initiative that continues to operate in secrecy, that has no internal strength to take on new challenges, or deal with issues which incorporation is already long overdue, and that continues to deny affected communities and other stakeholders their rightful place in the process""
The letter also points out that ""we find ourselves continuing to campaign against the very same projects that we expected the Principles to prevent or significantly improve: supersized dams blocking life-supporting rivers, driving thousands of people from their submerged villages and lands; huge mining projects scarring entire mountains and polluting rivers and seas with their waste; oil and gas pipelines carrying their toxic load straight through devastated forests and threatening marine sanctuaries; coal power plants belching out millions of tons of greenhouse gases into our already fatigued atmosphere; enormous paper mills with insatiable appetites that devour the last wilderness areas, etc. Much to our disappointment, the Equator Principles allow for all of these disgraces to proceed, only now in an ‘Equator compliant' mode.""
To improve the Principles so that they start to make a difference to people and planet the letter demands that adopting banks take immediate steps to:

open up, by improving the transparency of the Principles through full disclosure of banks' implementation efforts, on the project level, disclosure of all information related to a project's social and environmental impact.


be accountable, by improving the community consultation process, establishing guidelines for project grievance mechanisms, and establishing an accountability mechanism for the Principles themselves.


Expand the scope, by committing to apply the Principles, or an adapted version thereof, beyond project finance transactions to general corporate loans, asset management activities and Initial Public Offerings (IPOs).


Stop financing climate change, by developing exclusion criteria for projects and activities with a high impact on climate change, such as fossil fuel exploration projects and coal power plants, and by developing stringent climate targets for other projects financed ‘under Equator'.

""Our organisations have been in dialogue with the Equator Principles banks for six years,"" said Johan Frijns, BankTrack coordinator. ""We regret to conclude that so far little has been achieved as a result of these talks. Without additional bold steps forward the Principles risk becoming pretty insignificant for global efforts to create a just and sustainable world""
""There is a crucial difference between ‘environmental risk management' and ‘managing risks to the environment,'"" says Yann Louvel, campaigner with Les Amis de la Terre France; ""With the Equator Principles, the emphasis is too much focused on managing risks for the institutions itself, rather than properly dealing with risks posed to the environment and local communities when financing projects""
""Transparency is key for the Equator Principles to make a difference on the ground,"" says Michelle Chan of Friends of the Earth US. ""If Equator banks are not transparent about which projects they finance, how on earth is a local community supposed to know that a project is ‘under Equator', and that they have the right to be consulted and that their interests must be respected? This does not make any sense""
""There is something profoundly cynical about the notion of a large scale oil project that is ‘Equator compliant', but will nevertheless lead to millions of barrels of oil being extracted and ultimately burnt into the atmosphere,"" observed Andreas Missbach of the Berne Declaration in Switzerland. ""The world does not need Equator-compliant oil extraction; such projects urgently need to be stopped altogether if we want to have a chance to avoid catastrophic climate change unfolding""

São Paulo ",Santander deixa projeto de usina no rio Madeira,,,Rio Madeira dams: Jirau and Santo Antonio ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"

O banco Santander vendeu para o Fundo de Investimento do Fundo de 
Garantia do Tempo de Serviço (FI FGTS) os 5% do total das cotas que ainda 
detinha na sociedade dona da concessionária Santo Antônio Energia, que constrói 
a usina hidrelétrica de mesmo nome no rio Madeira.  O fundo administrado pela 
Caixa Econômica Federal (CEF) passa agora a ser dono de 10% do projeto e se 
compromete assim a investir R$ 1,3 bilhão na usina, 25% com capital próprio e o 
restante garantindo financiamentos.
O FI FGTS tem feito diversas aquisições de participações em 
empresas no setor de energia desde que saiu às compras no ano passado.  Somente 
nesses dois últimos meses, o fundo levou para análise dos órgãos de defesa da 
concorrência outras três operações, além dessa com o banco Santander.  O fundo 
está adquirindo participações na Nova Cibe Energia, J. Malucelli Energia e 
Hidrotérmica.  A primeira vai construir usinas termelétricas vendidas em leilão 
federal em 2008, mas enfrentava com dificuldades para conseguir sócios.  As 
outras duas empresas têm concessões para construir pequenas centrais 
hidrelétricas.
No ano passado, o fundo já tinha adquirido 4,98% da 
concessionária Santo Antonio Energia que pertencia também ao banco Santander.  O 
banco espanhol e o Banif montaram o fundo de investimentos em participações 
(FIP) Amazônica Energia e ficaram com 20% das cotas da concessionária.  Agora 
Banif e o FI FGTS dividem o controle da Amazônica Energia, que é um sócio 
importante pois faz parte do acordo de acionistas que dá o controle majoritário 
da concessionária aos sócios privados no empreendimento, Odebrecht e Andrade 
Gutierrez.  Os outros sócios do empreendimento são Furnas, subsidiária do grupo 
Eletrobrás, e Cemig.
O Santander entrou no projeto de Santo Antônio ainda na fase de 
licitação da usina hidrelétrica, no fim de 2007.  Ao formar o FIP, Santander e 
Banif aportaram R$ 250 milhões no fundo e a expectativa já era deixar o projeto, 
mas a intenção inicial era esperar a fase de implantação da usina para poder 
precificá-la.  Santo Antônio tem hoje 15% do projeto concluído e, desde que as 
obras iniciaram em setembro de 2008, os investimentos já ultrapassam R$ 3 
bilhões.  Cerca de R$ 1 bilhão foi aporte dos sócios.
A última ata de assembleia geral de quotistas do FIP Amazônia 
energia, registrada na Comissão de Valores Mobiliários (CVM) no dia 17 de 
dezembro, relata que desde aquela data estava decidido que o Santander deixaria 
a gestão do fundo, que foi assumida pelo Banif.  A CEF passou a ser o 
administrador do fundo.  Na mesma assembleia foi aprovada ainda uma 
capitalização R$ 430 milhões no FIP Amazônia Energia para fazer frente aos 
investimentos da usina.
O fundo de infraestrutura que usa os recursos do FGTS já é sócio 
da Odebrecht em três projetos: Santo Antônio, Embraport e Foz do Chapecó.  Os 
investimentos são na casa dos bilhões.  Mas o FI FGTS tem se tornado sócio de 
vários outros grupos que estão ingressando no setor de energia.  Garante com 
isso a execução de projetos hidrelétricos e agora termelétricos, com a 
associação com a Nova Cibe.  A empresa pertence aos grupos Bertin e Equipav e é 
dona de concessões de usinas vendidas em leilão federal de energia em 2008.  A 
Cibe passava por dificuldades para encontrar um sócio que ajudasse a garantir 
financiamento para a construção de 15 usinas termelétricas, sendo que seis 
precisam estar prontas já em janeiro de 2011.
O total do investimento é estimado em R$ 10 bilhões.  Até agora, 
porém, poucas delas tiveram a outorga concedida pela Aneel.  A Cibe não informou 
entretanto se essa participação do FI FGTS na Nova Cibe contempla a sociedade 
para construir todas as usinas vendidas.  Quando o JBS adquiriu o grupo Bertin, 
no ano passado, ele chegou a consultar a Aneel quanto à possibilidade de ter 
seis das usinas totalmente vinculadas à empresa, tirando esses projetos da 
estrutura da Cibe.

São Paulo ",Entidade entra com petição para esclarecer os impactos da usina do rio Madeira,,,Rio Madeira dams: Jirau and Santo Antonio ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"

O Instituto Madeira Vivo (IMV), uma organização de Rondônia que 
atua em defesa do rio Madeira, entrou recentemente com uma petição para prestar 
esclarecimentos sobre a usina hidrelétrica de Santo Antônio, no rio Madeira.
Trata-se de uma petição chamada Amicus Curiae, ou Amigo da Corte, 
na tradução do latim.  Ela é uma figura jurídica surgida na tradição anglo-saxã, 
e que recentemente tem sido aceita na jurisdição brasileira.
A petição, que foi oficialmente entregue no dia 15 de dezembro e 
ainda aguarda apreciação do juiz, permite a terceiros interessados em uma 
controvérsia jurídica fazer considerações em ações que tenham relevância social, 
como na área de direitos humanos ou meio ambiente.
De acordo com a advogada Fernanda Venzon    , que coordenou a redação da 
petição, o Instituto Madeira Vivo pede ao juiz a participação na Ação Civil 
Pública proposta pelas organizações Amigos da Terra - Amazônia Brasileira, 
Associação de Defesa Etno-ambiental Kanindé e Coordenação das Organizações 
Indígenas da Amazônia Brasileira (Coiab), em junho de 2009 contra a construção 
da usina de Santo Antônio.
""A ação foi promovida por organizações civis contra o governo e o 
consórcio.  Mas o Amicus Curiae não está defendendo nem uma parte, nem outra.  
Ele defende os interesses sociais e ambientais que estão em jogo nessa questão.  
Ele serve para mostrar ao juiz que tem mais coisas a serem vistas, 
principalmente na questão de direitos humanos"".
Direitos Humanos
A contribuição do IMV para a ação levanta problemas na construção 
da usina de Santo Antônio que resultam em danos às populações afetadas.  O 
texto, por exemplo, questiona o tratamento dado pelos empreendedores e governo 
aos povos indígenas, já que o licenciamento ""deixou desprotegidos os povos 
indígenas isolados, sobre os quais não há sequer estudos de impacto ambiental, 
pese a que a obras já começaram, o que os põe em situação de extrema 
vulnerabilidade"".
Além disso, Fernanda ressalta que não foram feitas consultas às 
populações afetadas no Brasil, muito menos na Bolívia.  ""Os impactos na Bolívia 
praticamente sumiram dos estudos!"".  Segundo o Amicus Curiae, as populações 
devem ser consultadas, pois elas têm ""uma relação profunda com suas terras e 
recursos naturais.  Devido a esta relação, seus direitos humanos fundamentais 
estão estreitamente vinculados com o bem-estar de suas terras e recursos 
naturais, o que os deixa vulneráveis quando alguma atividade impacta 
negativamente o ambiente do qual dependem"".
O texto mostra que existem diversos problemas nos estudos e no 
tratamento dado aos povos indígenas impactados.  Por exemplo, as comunidades 
localizadas à jusante dos empreendimentos foram desconsideradas nos estudos, não 
foi dada a devida importância à presença de povos isolados na área de influência 
das usinas e as medidas tomadas são ""insuficientes para compensar ou mitigar os 
impactos"".
O documento também levanta falhas no processo de licenciamento 
ambiental, como a pressão para aprovar as usinas e a arbitrariedade na concessão 
das licenças.  Um exemplo foi substituir os Estudos de Impacto Ambiental (EIA) 
não aprovados pela equipe técnica do Ibama por pareceres de consultores 
independentes, que foram realizados às pressas e sem discussão em audiências 
públicas.

Australia ",Swedish bank Nordea backs away from Gunns’ Pulp Mill,Nordea ,Finland,Tamar Valley Pulp Mill Tasmania (formerly Gunns Pulp Mill) ,forestry - pulp and paper,Australia,"
For the first time, Nordea bank announced today that it would not finance the Gunns’ pulp mill in Australia if its widely publicised environmental impacts were not curbed.
The announcement, made by Nordea via Twitter, came in response to a two-day blitz of public pressure. The campaign kicked off with an action from global campaign network Avaaz.org, and triggered engagement from thousands of Scandinavian citizens including many Nordea customers and shareholders.
“Avaaz.org members across Scandinavia have sent over five thousand emails and Twitter messages to Nordea in just the last two days to protect vital forests in Australia,” said Avaaz Executive Director Ricken Patel. “Many were customers threatening to take their business elsewhere if Nordea financed a pulp mill that will destroy some of the most important forests in the world.”
Nordea Communication Director Rune K. Sjøhelle responded to Avaaz's public Twitter petition today with the announcement that Nordea “would not finance a project in the form presented in the media so far.” (See full text below and at http://act.ly/1kz ).
However, campaigners are working to ensure that Nordea lays out clear and strong environmental standards to use in evaluating whether to finance the mill.
“Until last week, Nordea was one of the only banks in the world that hadn’t ruled out financing the project in its current form,” said Paul Oosting, pulp mill campaigner for The Wilderness Society.
""Now Nordea must make clear the specific standards by which they would evaluate the project,"" said Mr. Oosting.
In response to public outcry, more than 15 leading banks around the world- including all those in Australia- have publicly declined to finance the mill. The Swedish paper and pulp company, Södra, has said that it would only consider the project given specific safeguards. Campaigners say that Nordea's safeguards must be at least as strong as Södra's and include moving the proposed mill to a more suitable site where it won't impact human health and local fishing, farming and tourism.
""Gunns Ltd must not be permitted to shop around for a financier with the lowest environmental standards,"" said Mr. Oosting. ""Nordea should join Södra and insist that any pulp mill development be totally chlorine free, Forest Stewardship Council certified, fully assessed to community standards, draw 100% on existing plantations rather than native forests and be situated in a different location.
""It's clear that Nordea is listening to its customers,"" said Mr. Patel. ""Now it's time for Nordea to do the right thing and earn its customers' applause.""
The campaign illustrates the growing reach of global civil society groups to shape the actions of international corporations.
""This campaign started with Australian Avaaz members asking Scandinavian members to take action,"" Mr. Patel noted. ""With new high powered global citizens' movements like Avaaz, corporations and banks will face responsibility everywhere for what they do anywhere.""
Full statement from Nordea:Nordea has not made any decision or commitment to finance the project in Tasmania.When customers approach us regarding new projects, we obviously consider whether it is possible to provide financing for the project according to our policies and procedures. Social and environmental impacts are always included in our evaluation of new projects, and we do not finance projects in conflict with international norms.We cannot comment on potential customer relationships. However, we would not finance a project in the form presented in the media so far.As part of our Corporate Social Responsibility, Nordea is a signatory to the UN Global Compact, the UNEP FI, the Equator Principles, and supports the OECD Guidelines for multinational enterprises.Rune Kibsgaard Sjøhelle

São Paulo ",Expedição confirma presença de índios isolados perto de hidrelétrica em RO,,,Rio Madeira dams: Jirau and Santo Antonio ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"

Altino Machado
Uma expedição que percorreu a Estação Ecológica Mujica Nava, em 
Porto Velho (RO), constatou vestígios da presença de índios isolados numa faixa 
entre 10 e 30 quilômetros do canteiro de obras da usina hidrelétrica de 
Jirau.
Realizada entre os dias 26 de novembro e 10 de dezembro, a 
expedição também encontrou dois garimpeiros que avistaram oito indígenas na 
margem da estrada de um garimpo.  Os depoimentos deles foram gravados em áudio e 
vídeo.
Os garimpeiros transitavam de moto quando avistaram os índios na 
margem da mata.  Os índios estavam a uma distância de aproximadamente 80 
metros.  Assustados, os garimperiso aceleraram a moto.  Os indígenas, também 
assustados, entraram na mata.
Os garimpeiros estacionaram a moto mais à frente do local onde os 
índios entraram na floresta.  Quando olharam para trás viram que os índios 
haviam retornado à beira da estrada e os observavam.
Alguns índios estavam nus e outros usavam roupas velhas e 
rasgadas.  Outros integrantes do grupo estavam calçados com chinelos coloridos 
de pares diferentes.  Alguns deles usavam chapéus de palha tradicionais.  Um 
homem portava uma espécie de borduna e outro um arco e flechas.
- Os garimpeiros e os índios estavam assustados com esse 
encontro, tendo os indígenas fugido às pressas para a floresta - assinala o 
relatório, que contou com a participação de equipes da Fundação Nacional do 
Índio (Funai), Sistema de Proteção da Amazônia (Sipam), Centro de Trabalho 
Indigenista (CTI), Monte Sinai e Associação de Defesa Etno-Ambiental 
Kanindé.
Nas cabeceiras do igarapé Queixada, foram encontrados arbustos e 
folhas de babaçu quebrados manualmente, além de duas retiradas de mel nas 
árvores, com o formato tradicional feito por indígenas.
Também foi encontrada uma área pequena, de aproximadamente um 
hectare, que parecia ser um desmatamento recente, podendo ser uma roça de 
índios, na divisa dos estados de Rondônia e Amazonas.
Num tabocal na nascente do igarapé Tuchaua foram localizados mais 
arbustos quebrados e torcidos por indígenas.  Numa fazenda localizada no 
interior do Parque Nacional Mapinguari também foram encontrados vestígios da 
ocupação indígena.
De acordo com o relatório, é provável que o local tradicional de 
ocupação desses indígenas seja a região que envolve a Estação Ecológica Serra 
dos Três Irmãos/Mujica Nava, Parque Nacional do Mapinguari, numa faixa que varia 
de 10 a 30 km da hidrelétrica de Jirau.
O relatório observa que as explosões efetuadas na construção da 
hidrelétrica está afugentando os índios daquela região para o garimpo da Macisa, 
onde foram avistados, com circulação frequ¨ente de malária e hepatites.
O relatório recomenda que o grupo indígena seja monitorado para 
evitar que seja atingido por doenças ou dizimado em confrontos com brancos.  
Também recomenda a realização de expedições periódicas para localizar a área de 
ocupação e propor interdição do território indígena.
- Estamos comemorando a existência desses indícios.  A gente já 
consegue saber oficialmente que existem pelo menos oito pessoas e podemos 
localizar geograficamente onde elas estão.  Percebe-se que estão assustados com 
as explosões, que afugentam a caça.  É uma realidade grave - afirma Telma 
Monteiro     , da Associação de Defesa 
Etno-Ambiental Kanindé.
Isolados no Maranhão
A Funai confirmou nesta semana a existência de indígenas isolados 
na Terra Indígena Araribóia, no Maranhão.  Uma expedição encontrou vestígios 
recentes próximos a lagoa Samaúma.
Desde a década de 1980 a Funai tem conhecimento do grupo, mas há 
algum tempo não encontrava provas tão concretas da permanência dos indígenas na 
região.  O grupo isolado é, provavelmente, pertencente ao povo Awa Guajá e pode 
chegar ao total de 60 pessoas.
Nas trilhas abertas pelos isolados, além dos rastros de pegadas, 
a equipe da Funai constatou o intenso processo de devastação da mata.  A 
exploração de madeira no interior da Terra Indígena é um problema histórico.  Há 
mais de 20 anos os madeireiros retiram, principalmente, cedro, sapucaia, copaíba 
e cerejeira.

Bruno Calixto    
Uma apresentação feita pela Associação de Defesa Etno-Ambiental 
Kanindé à Comissão Parlamentar de Inquérito (CPI) da Assembleia Legislativa de 
Rondônia, criada para investigar as obras das usinas do rio Madeira (RO), 
impressionou os deputados estaduais.  As fotos mostram o estrago que a usina de 
Jirau vem causando ao meio ambiente.
As imagens foram apresentadas pela ambientalista e pesquisadora 
da área de energia Telma Monteiro    , representante da Kanindé.  
A associação foi convidada pela CPI a prestar informações e apresentar 
documentos que comprovem a existência de irregularidades no processo de 
licenciamento das usinas do Madeira e impactos sociais e ambientais causados 
pelas obras.
""As imagens das obras de Jirau mostram claramente os danos que o 
empreendimento tem causado.  As últimas fotos são avassaladoras, e os deputados 
ficaram mudos ao ver o estrago"", explica Telma.
A pesquisadora também apresentou estudos e respondeu perguntas 
dos deputados.  ""Nós trouxemos muitas informações e documentos que os deputados 
desconheciam, como as fichas de resumo da Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica 
(Aneel), sobre as hidrelétricas de Santo Antônio e Jirau, que mostram custos 
ambientais no valor de R$ 1,2 bilhão para cada usina.  Os deputados quase caíram 
da cadeira quando viram essas cifras"", explica Telma.

produzido pela Aneel, que apresenta um custo ambiental de R$ 1,2 bilhão
A ambientalista cobrou da CPI que peça explicações aos consórcios 
responsáveis pelas obras sobre os custos ambientais do projeto, já que a Aneel 
aprovou esse documento, assim como os estudos de viabilidade da usina, sem que 
fossem explicados os critérios utilizados para se chegar a esse valor.
A pesquisadora também denunciou problemas envolvendo a 
contaminação do rio por mercúrio, o aumento da malária e a mortandade de peixes, 
além de impactos sociais, envolvendo índios e ribeirinhos.  ""As usinas têm 
causado violações dos direitos humanos, dano às terras indígenas e 
principalmente a tribos de índios isolados"".
A equipe da Kanindé participou de uma operação junto com a 
Fundação Nacional do Índio (Funai), que fez o levantamento de índios isolados 
existentes nas unidades de conservação Mujica Nava, Serra dos Três Irmãos e 
Mapinguari.  Lá, encontraram vestígios da presença de indígenas isolados.  Oito 
índios- seis homens e duas mulheres-foram vistos por garimpeiros que estão 
invadindo a região.

Nijmegen, Netherlands ",BankTrack calls upon banks to help fight runaway climate change,,,,,,"
International banks are not doing enough to help combat runaway climate
change. They should commit to fundamental changes in their lending and
investment practices so that their business activities contribute to solving
the climate crisis, rather than further aggravating it. A failure to do so may
lead to the serious reputational risk of being branded as co-responsible for
climate destruction.
This is the key message of a new position paper of BankTrack, ‘A
Challenging Climate 2.0; what banks must do to combat climate change',
launched today during the climate talks in Copenhagen.
With some laudable exceptions, commercial banks so far have not done
enough to ensure that their business decisions do not worsen climate change,
let alone solve it. A number of banks are even instrumental in financing
activities and sectors that directly cause climate change, such as ongoing oil
and gas exploration, extraction and distribution (including tar sands
exploration), coal mining (including mountain top removal practices), energy
generation in coal power plants, and projects causing widespread deforestation
and forest degradation.
Recent initiatives such as the Climate Principles and Carbon principles
lack the ambition needed to create a fundamental shift in business practices,
while the best-known sustainable finance initiative, the Equator Principles,
places no binding obligation whatsoever on banks to take climate impacts into
account when providing project finance.
The BankTrack
paper also argues that the emphasis banks put on carbon trading is
misguided, as it is leading them away from the real contributions that they
could be making to solve the climate crisis: mobilising new capital to finance
the shift towards a low carbon economy.
BankTrack therefore calls upon commercial banks to develop a
sufficiently ambitious, publicly-available climate policy. Specifically:
Banks should take steps to disengage from all activities and projects that
substantially contribute to climate change. They should:
* End support for all new coal, oil and gas extraction and delivery;
* End support for all new coal-fired power plants; and
* End support for the most harmful and least efficient practices in
other GHG-intensive sectors, such as agriculture, forestry and transportation;
Banks should also minimize the extent to which their remaining activities and
investments contribute to climate change. They should:
* Assess and report on GHG pollution associated with all their loans,
investments, and other financial services;
* Establish sufficiently ambitious portfolio and business-unit emissions
reduction targets in line with current science on climate stabilization; and
* Develop a set of tools to address climate issues and reduce GHG
pollution across the full range of their operations and services.
Banks should increase their support for the development and use of
climate-friendly technologies and production processes. They should:
* Increase support for GHG pollution reduction technology, renewable
energy production and energy efficiency in all business lines; and
* Develop products and services to help retail customers address climate
change.
Banks should
not engage in so called ‘false solutions' to climate change, such as
carbon trading and the financing of nuclear energy, large scale hydropower,
biofuel production with a negative socio-environmental impacts, natural gas
exploration and carbon capture and storage.
The paper is the platform that BankTrack member groups will use when
advocating for better climate change policies at banks in their own countries.

""There is no lack of words spent by banks on how to deal with climate
change; what is lacking so far is serious follow up that does not shy away from
making hard choices; for example shifting away from financing fossil fuel
extraction and focusing on renewable energy sources,"" says Johan Frijns,
BankTrack coordinator. ""Continuing to be a major financier of oil
and gas while doing a bit of renewables on the side is not going to save banks'
hard-won reputations.""
""Most climate policies tend to focus on risks posed by climate change
for the business activities of banks. What we urgently need is for banks to
focus on the risks their business poses to the climate"" says Bill Barclay, present in Copenhagen on behalf of
Rainforest Action Network.
""Banks have an important role to play in financing the transition
to a low-carbon future, but their focus on carbon trading is misdirected, and
in the context of these negotiations, harmful,"" said Michelle Chan of Friends of the Earth - US, referring to how rich countries are attempting to count private
investments in carbon offset credits as public funding for international
climate finance under the UNFCCC. ""Banks should focus on allocating
capital to activities that help fundamentally shift us to a low-carbon path,
rather than speculating on carbon commodities.""

Vientiane, Laos ",Theun Hinboun hydropower plant expansion progresses,ANZ ,Australia,Theun-Hinboun dam expansion ,energy plants - dams,Laos,"
Theun-Hinboun Power Company Limited (THPC) started diverting the Nam Ngouang River yesterday to block the waterway for dam construction in Borikhamxay province.
The diversion will direct water through a tunnel before it re-connects about 300 metres further on in Thasala village, Khamkeuth district.
The diversion is part of construction work for the Theun Hinboun Expansion Project in Khammuan province and marks a new stage in the project.
The Theun-Hinboun hydropower plant and its expansion are located in the provinces of Borikhamxay and Khammuan.
“The Nam Gnouang River was selected for the dam expansion because it will store water during the rainy season for release into the Theun Hinboun dam in the dry season,” said Electricite du Laos (EDL) Managing Director Khammany Inthirath, at the Nam Ngouang River diversion ceremony.
The ceremony was also attended by Deputy Prime Minister Asang Laoly.
During the rainy season, the Theun Hinboun dam will be operated solely by water from the Nam Theun River.
The expansion project is expected to be completed by June 2012 and will have an installed capacity of 280 megawatts to generate electricity.
“It is estimated that 24 percent of the expansion project has been completed so far, after work began in May this year following preliminary planning in 2008,” Khammany said.
THPC is spending about 6.2 trillion kip (US$720 million) on the project, 20 percent of which consists of the company's own equity and the remaining 80 percent is sourced from financial institutions.
It is developing an expansion project to improve the distribution of energy for local supply and export as well as increasing generator capacity from 220MW to 500MW, which will generate more than 3,000 million kilowatt hours per year.
Upon completion of the dam, 440MW will be sold to Thailand with the remaining 60MW sold to EDL for local supply.
The expansion project was initiated following financial restructuring in mid-2002 and because the Nam Theun 2 hydropower project's completion and commercial operation will reduce the volume of water currently available for the Theun Hinboun dam.
Currently the company sells 95 percent of its existing plant's installed capacity of 220MW, with just 5 percent put aside for local supply.
THPC's three shareholders have sought compensatory alternatives by studying the viability of a water storage dam along the Nam Gnouang River in Borikhamxay province, with water diverted to the Theun Hinboun dam.
Shareholding in THPC consists of 60 percent for the government through EDL, with Nordic Hydro (Statkraft) and GMS Lao holding 20 percent each.
THPC was the first independent hydropower project in Laos and has operated successfully since 1998. The project began in 1995. "

San Francisco ",Ex-Im bank undermines U.S. credibility at Copenhagen with $3 billion in financing for ExxonMobil,DNB ,Norway,Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) project ,oil and gas,Papua New Guinea,"
As global climate talks begin in
Copenhagen, the U.S. Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank) is undermining U.S
Government goals by announcing its approval for a record-breaking three billion
dollars in financing to the ExxonMobil-led Papua New Guinea Liquid Natural Gas
project (PNG LNG).  The PNG LNG project will emit vast amounts of
lifecycle greenhouse gases, slash a pipeline through globally significant primary tropical
forests, spew toxic pollutants, and foster an increase in violence in project
affected areas.
The U.S. Ex-Im Bank´s provision of
$3 billion in financing subsidies to Exxon conflicts with President Obama´s and
other G20 leaders´ commitment in September to phase out fossil fuel subsidies
as a step toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving an agreement
in Copenhagen.
The U.S. Ex-Im Bank estimates that
PNG LNG will emit 3,100,000 tons of CO2 every year in direct emissions, yet
even this figure omits the much greater lifecycle emissions associated with LNG
schemes which includes pipeline transport, liquefaction, tanker transport,
re-gasificaion and ultimate combustion of this fossil fuel. According to a Carnegie
Mellon study, lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions for LNG projects are more comparable
to the lifecycle emissions of coal projects.
""Ex-Im Bank´s $3 billion
subsidy to the world´s most profitable oil and gas company for a massive
greenhouse gas emitting project directly contradicts U.S. government commitments to cut
fossil fuel subsidies and reduce greenhouse gas emissions,"" said Doug
Norlen, Policy Director for Pacific Environment. ""How can other
governments take the U.S climate change commitments seriously if it is
financing the increase of emissions through such fossil fuel projects?""
Papua New Guinea is home to world-class forest
biodiversity. Within the country, nearly 80% of the PNG population depend on
biological resources to sustain their physical, spiritual and social
livelihoods. PNG has several thousand indigenous communities of diverse language,
customs and traditions.
The environmental and social
impacts of the PNG LNG project are severe. The LNG project includes an LNG
liquefaction plant, a 407 km offshore pipeline, and a 248 km onshore pipeline,
much of which will slash through previously undisturbed primary tropical
forests with biodiversity of global significance. The pipeline will impact
remote tribal and communal lands, many of which have never before experienced a
pipeline project of any kind, much less one of this magnitude.
The result is growing conflicts
between communities and the company over revenues and land rights which have
begun to turn violent. Local uprisings and conflicts about the project already
occurred this past Fall. In May 2009, Transparency International PNG
publicly announced its ""grave concern"" about the transparency of
project´s Benefit Sharing Agreement after the group´s invitation to serve as an
independent observer at the fund´s negotiating forum was unexpectedly
withdrawn.
""These conflicts may presage
more violence between local communities and a foreign oil giant that is viewed
as stealing the peoples´land. Ex-Im Bank should have learned that lesson in Peru and Nigeria,
but instead they expose themselves -and U.S. taxpayers- to increased risks
and responsibility for increasing bloodshed,"" said Norlen.
Ex-Im Bank recently developed a
Carbon Policy, under pressure from an agreement settling a lawsuit filed by
environmental groups. However, environmental groups criticize Ex-Im Bank´s
Carbon Policy for failing to actually curb carbon emissions and for the agency´s
paltry support for renewable energy, which in recent years has been less than
2% of its financing for fossil fuel projects.
Ex-Im Bank financing of PNG LNG
also turns a blind eye to corruption. In February 2009, the engineering firm
Kellogg, Brown and Root (KBR) received the second largest criminal penalty in
the history of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act for arranging $182
million in bribes to secure engineering, procurement and construction contracts
on Ex-Im Bank- financed Nigeria LNG project. In June 2009, KBR announced
that it and WorleyParsons have formed a joint venture, Eos,
which has secured a similar engineering contract on the PNG LNG project.
Notes:
 
Note: Other export credit agencies
that are expected to provide smaller amounts of financing for PNG LNG, include
the Australian Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC), Japan´s Nippon
Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI), the Italian Istituto per i Servizi Assicurativi
el Credito all'Espotazione (SACE), and the Korea Export Insurance Corporation (KEIC)/Korean
Export Import Bank (KEXIM). Private banks potentially involved include ANZ, CBA,

Australia ",Banks must prove they give a dam,ANZ ,Australia,Theun-Hinboun dam expansion ,energy plants - dams,Laos,"
Given the role banks played in the global financial crisis, it is reasonable to expect they would understand the need to demonstrate their ethics with transparency.
No longer is it reasonable to assume shareholders and customers will simply accept a ""trust us, we have good policies"" response.
But this is exactly the response of ANZ when it comes to the Theun-Hinboun Expansion Project - a dam and diversion project under construction in central Laos.
This huge project is a hydro-electric scheme, with power being sold across the border to Thailand to bring in much needed export earnings for impoverished Laos.
The project involves a 65-metre-high storage dam on the Nam Gnouang River and a doubling of capacity at the existing Theun-Hinboun hydro-power plant, resulting in a doubling of the amount of water diverted into the Hai and Hinboun Rivers.
It is estimated the project will displace more than 4000 indigenous people from the reservoir area and will affect the lives of more than 50,000 people downstream.
ANZ is one of the banks helping finance the project. Commendably, the bank has also committed itself to comply with the Equator Principles, an international set of guidelines for banks that finance large-scale projects.
But a field visit to the area in May by BankTrack and International Rivers found evidence that the project was violating Laotian resettlement law and the Equator Principles.
Already water levels along the Hai and Hinboun rivers have dramatically changed as a result of the existing dam, causing erosion and flooding, leading to the loss of fertile agricultural land, fruit trees, riverbank gardens, livestock and boats in more than 55 villages.
The evidence suggests the existing Theun-Hinboun project has violated the national law by failing to provide adequate compensation for the loss of livelihoods and property in downstream villages.
This comes from one of the original consulting firms, Resource Management and Research, which was contracted to conduct the environmental impact assessment for the proposed expansion.
It estimated that by 2005, the original Theun-Hinboun project had caused the Hai River channel to widen by about 45 metres, leading to the loss of 68 hectares of land. RMR said the value of the land was between $US100,000 ($A108,000) and $US136,000, but the impoverished villagers had not received any compensation for the loss.
Moreover, RMR estimated at least 820 hectares of fertile rice paddy had been abandoned due to flooding - again with no compensation paid to villagers.
The expansion project will violate local law by failing to provide food allowances and relocation assistance for those being resettled.
The Theun-Hinboun Power Company, which owns the projects, promised to provide displaced people with 440 kilograms of milled rice per person a year. Villagers claim to be getting less than this.
THPC general manager Robert Allen has admitted to breaking this agreement, saying the promised amount is too much.
UCA Funds Management, an entity of the Uniting Church in Australia, operates several investment funds, all of which have investments in ANZ.
As an ethical investor, it raised concerns with the bank about the evidence collected in Laos.
The bank's response was that it would not ""comment on the operations of individual clients"". Instead, the bank says the Uniting Church needs to speak with THPC directly (its international partners have been doing this since 1998).
Surely the bank itself has responsibility to ensure its investments are socially and environmentally sound, and not rely on third parties for that assurance. And surely being transparent about those investments is part of that responsible behaviour.
As a bank seeking to expand its operations within Asia, ANZ should be keen to demonstrate its commitment to ethical values.
While client confidentiality needs to be respected, a demonstrated transparent accountability to ethical standards is something ANZ should also be seeking to embrace if it wishes to be regarded as a leader in this area. By contrast, another bank funding the project, BNP Paribas, has been far more open about the project and has promised a detailed response to the issues raised.
It is not being suggested that the dam projects be closed down. Rather, the issue is about ensuring that THPC obeys the local law and provides adequate compensation to the lives of dirt-poor villagers for the severe disruption its projects have and will cause.
ANZ says it shares concern for this outcome, but it fails to understand the world now requires a ""show us"" response from banks rather than trusting their word - especially in the face of conflicting evidence from the ground. "

Laos ","""Sustainable Finance"" undermines food security of Lao communities",ANZ ,Australia,Theun-Hinboun dam expansion ,energy plants - dams,Laos,"
The Theun-Hinboun Expansion Project - a dam and water diversion project now under construction in Central Laos - poses a threat to the livelihoods and food security of local communities living in the project area. The project also violates Lao national law and the Equator Principles, according to ‘Expanding Failure', a new report and video released today by International Rivers; BankTrack, FIVAS, Les Amis de la Terre; and Justice and International Mission Unit, Uniting Church in Australia.
The project is displacing 4,186 indigenous people from the reservoir area and will affect another 51,441 people living downstream. Already water levels along the Hai and Hinboun Rivers have dramatically changed as a result of the existing dam. The new project will result in additional flooding and displacement, making life unbearable for many people. As one of the villagers in Tha village told the researchers, ""The project company did not appropriately compensate for the existing project and we are already poor. With the expansion project, the company will make us poorer!""
The project is being financed by three international banks - ANZ of Australia, BNP Paribas of France and KBC of Belgium- that have committed to the Equator Principles, a set of social and environmental guidelines for private banks. The report was based on a field visit by BankTrack and International Rivers to the project area in May 2009.
Ikuko Matsumoto, Lao Program Director for International Rivers and the report author says, ""These violations are unacceptable for a project that is being financed by three commercial banks that have adopted the Equator Principles. The project will undermine food security for up to 50,000 Laotians and the plans to restore livelihoods are woefully inadequate. The banks funding the project have promised that people's lives will be restored. They must take this responsibility seriously and put people before profits.""
""Equator Principles Financial Institutions need to be publicly accountable and transparent on their implementation of the Equator Principles,"" said Sonja Willems, Campaign Officer for BankTrack. ""We are calling on the involved banks to conduct a mission to the project site, engage with the company to ensure the compliance with the Equator Principles and Lao law, and withhold disbursement to the company until the project is brought into compliance,"".
The report was sent for comments to the three Equator Banks and Statkraft, the Norwegian owner of the project, in advance of its public release. In their response they stated that they considered the project in compliance with the regulatory framework, but due to confidentiality reasons refused to further discuss the details of the project with civil society.
-------------------------
Video:
A short video (8 minutes) including interviews with dam affected villagers is also available. 
Financial information about the project:
In October 2008, the ANZ, BNP Paribas, and KBC participated in a US$187.5 million syndicated loan arranged by Exim Bank of Thailand. The four Thai banks, Bank of Ayudhya, Kasikorn Bank, Siam City Bank and Thanachart Bank, participated in a 13,940 million baht syndicated loan also arranged by the Thai Exim Bank. Exim Bank of Thailand also provided a US$100 million project finance loan. (Exim Bank of Thailand Press Release, October 8, 2008). The Theun-Hinboun project is owned by the state utility Electricité du Laos, the Norwegian state-owned energy company Statkraft and GMS Power of Thailand, who together comprise the Theun-Hinboun Power Company (THPC).
Key facts
The Theun-Hinboun Expansion Project involves a 65-meter high storage dam on the Nam Gnouang River and a doubling of capacity at the existing Theun-Hinboun hydropower plant, resulting in a doubling of the amount of water diverted into the Hai and Hinboun Rivers
The report, based on a field visit by BankTrack and International Rivers to the project area in May 2009, documents how Lao villagers are being sold down the river in a hydro deal that will displace thousands of people from their homes and land, and deprive thousands more of access to fertile rice fields, riverbank vegetable gardens, grazing lands, forests and fisheries, undermining local communities' rights to access food. Already water levels along the Hai and Hinboun Rivers have dramatically changed as a result of the existing dam, which has caused erosion and flooding along the rivers leading to the loss of fertile agricultural land, fruit trees, riverbank gardens, livestock and boats in more than 55 villages.
The report found that the project was in violation of Lao government resettlement law and the Equator Principles in numerous instances. The Theun-Hinboun Power Company is also failing to comply with its Concession Agreement and Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). These violations include: Compensation for loss of assets and livelihoods in the downstream villages as a result of the original Theun-Hinboun Project has not been paid ; no provision of a range of resettlement options to the downstream villagers , and no documentation on ""good faith negotiations"" with the affected indigenous communities .

London ",Secret documents reveal multi-million dollar shopping spree by African dictator’s son,Bank of America ,United States,,,,"
Confidential
U.S. government documents uncovered by campaign group Global Witness and reported
on in today's New York Times, strongly suggest that Teodorin Obiang, son of the
dictator of oil-rich Equatorial Guinea, purchased a $33 million private jet, a
$35 million Malibu mansion, speedboats and a fleet of fast cars using corruptly
acquired funds.
A new
Global Witness report, ‘The Secret Life of a Shopaholic', explains how, despite
the ample evidence against him, the investigation is going nowhere and Teodorin
continues to be allowed into the U.S. He is reported to be building a custom
200 foot yacht with shark tank but the ordinary citizens of the West African
nation continue to exist in poverty and oppression.
""U.S. law
requires the State Department to deny visas to foreign officials when there is
credible evidence they are involved in corruption; yet the authorities have
continued to allow Teodorin to come and go as he pleases. The only possible
excuse would be if there was an active investigation and a need to continue
gathering evidence, but the investigation is inactive. One wonders whether the
U.S. is inclined to turn a blind eye to the evidence of corruption-fuelled
excess because of its desire to retain access to his country's oil,"" said
Anthea Lawson, a senior investigator at Global Witness.  
According
to the documents from the Justice Department and Immigration and Customs
Enforcement (ICE), Teodorin, who earns a few thousand dollars a month as a
minister in his father's government, transferred about $75 million into U.S.
banks between 2005 and 2007, via wire transfers processed by Bank of America,
Wachovia, UBS, Union Bank of California and First American Trust.
The
first two of these banks filed suspicious activity reports to the authorities
about the transactions and eventually blacklisted him as a customer - but not
until after they had helped him move tens of millions of dollars into the
country.
""This
was a spectacular moral failing by the banks, and reveals a disturbing chain of
gaps in the design and implementation of the anti-money laundering laws. In
2004, the U.S.
bank, Riggs, was fined $41 million and sold off at a discount after a Senate
inquiry uncovered it was banking for the corrupt Obiang family. Have no lessons
been learnt at all?"" Ms Lawson said.
The
documents were written by investigators from the Justice Department and ICE to
request information from French law enforcement agencies as some of the
transfers had come via French banks. They relate to a preliminary money
laundering investigation. No charges have been made and sources have told
Global Witness that the investigation has effectively stalled.
""With its plentiful oil, paid for by American
companies, Equatorial Guinea
should be one of the richest countries in the world. Instead its people are
among the poorest, and the government is an extreme example of a kleptocracy in
action. The U.S. has
generally taken a far more effective and robust approach to tackling foreign
corruption and bribery than many of its international peers but it seems to
have a blind spot when it comes to Equatorial Guinea,"" said Ms Lawson.

London ",Indigenous Canadians deliver message to RBS and the Treasury: “Stop funding bloody oil!”,Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS)  ,United Kingdom, tar sands ,oil and gas,Congo,"
Three Indigenous Canadian women will visit the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) London headquarters tomorrow to demand that they stop financing one of the world's most polluting projects - the Tar Sands. This highly destructive form of oil extraction is having a devastating effect on the health of Indigenous communities and fuelling global climate change. They will be joined outside RBS by student activists who will stage a ‘die-in' on the ground, to demonstrate that ‘Tar Sands oil is blood oil'.
Earlier in the day the three women will brief MPs on the role of UK banks and oil companies in the Tar Sands in a Parliamentary meeting hosted by the Liberal Democrat Spokesman for Energy and Climate Change, Simon Hughes. They will also deliver an open letter to the Chancellor, Alistair Darling, questioning why the Treasury is allowing a state-owned bank to finance companies that are doing such damage to their communities.
The extraction of oil from Tar Sands is responsible for three to five times the carbon emissions of conventional oil.  According to new research by Rainforest Action Network, RBS - which is now 84% publicly-owned - has been responsible for $2.7 billion of finance to companies that own, or are building, Tar Sands infrastructure in Alberta, Canada, since the first banking bail-out took place.  RBS is also revealed as the UK bank most heavily involved in financing Tar Sands since 2007, providing almost $14 billion of finance. 
Eriel Tchekwie Deranger, one of the Indigenous women, explains:
""The Tar Sands is the world's largest and most destructive industrial development. It is destroying an area of ancient forest larger than England. Millions of litres a day of toxic waste are seeping into our groundwater and we are seeing terrifyingly high levels of cancer in our communities. It is shocking that a bank effectively owned by the British Government is financing a project which is killing Indigenous people.""
Heather Milton Lightening, adds:
""Just when the world is focusing its attention on attempts to cut carbon emissions at December's Copenhagen summit, the Canadian government is championing the extraction of billions of barrels of this dirty oil - and the UK taxpayer, through RBS, is financing it! We have come to the UK to get support in our struggle to leave Tar Sands in the ground, for the sake of our communities and for the climate.""
Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat spokesman for Energy and Climate Change, is hosting the group's visit to Parliament. He is critical of the Government's approach:
""Tar Sands are one of the most destructive fossil fuels on earth. They cause much more carbon pollution than any other oil, and are also responsible for massive damage to nature, wildlife and local communities. Now that the Government has used our taxes to prop up the banks, it must stop using our money to support companies in their extraction of high-polluting fuels like Tar Sands.""
The visit to RBS is part of a 10-day nationwide speaker tour organised by the UK Tar Sands Network , and north-America-based Indigenous Environmental Network. People & Planet, the UK's largest student campaigning network, are co-organising the RBS protest. Along with PLATFORM and World Development Movement, they are currently taking legal action to force the Treasury to properly assess the consequences of RBS investing public money in Tar Sands and similar projects . Alex Fountain, a People & Planet activist and student at Manchester Metropolitan University, says:
""RBS is Europe's dirtiest bank. It specialises in financing projects that trample over communities and trash the climate. We are here today, in solidarity with the Indigenous communities who are being killed by Tar Sands pollution, to tell RBS: stop funding this bloody oil.""

Turkey ",Ilisu construction restarted without permission,,,Ilisu dam ,energy plants - dams,Turkey,"
Construction work has restarted on the
controversial Ilisu Dam in Turkey,
despite the project lacking the appropriate permits. Work on the project had
been stopped following the withdrawal of financial support by the export credit
agencies (ECAs) of Switzerland, Austria and Germany earlier this year. The ECAs withdrew after Turkey failed to
honour commitments to bring the project up to international standards. 
The Initiative to Keep Hasankeyf Alive, a regional coalition opposed to the project,
has now discovered that dozens of workers and many machines are have now
recommenced work in the vicinity of Ilisu village, without official permission
from Turkey's State Water Works (DSI). According to the Hasankeyf-Initiative,
the DSI sent a letter to the consortium which has the contract from the project
on 28nd October 2009 ordering it to stop the construction.     ""We are asking the responsible minister for environment, Veysel Eroglu, what is
going on? How is it possible that companies may build without any
authorisation?"" states Ipek Tasli, the international coordinator of the
Initiative.     The villagers of Ilisu state that they were told to leave their houses by the
end of November. They were told that they could buy new houses in the new
settlement sites. These are however more expensive than the compensation they
received for their current houses and it is unclear how they can restore their
income in the new settlement. So the affected people have said they will move
to the cities. A new wave of displacement will start soon unless the expulsion
is stopped now.     After the withdrawal of the three European governments the minister for
environment, Veysel Eroglu, claimed several times that Turkey would
find another source of finance for the Ilisu Project, instead of reconsidering
it. ""There was no convincing position by the government for our region's
development. We would like to know why the construction has started again. Is
this in connection with the visit of the Turkish Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek
in China
in mid-September 2009?"" asks the Initiative's European spokesperson Ercan
Ayboga. ""As we remember Mehmet Simsek said, when he was in China, that the
Ilisu project was also discussed.""     ""Why is the Turkish government insisting on this project so much although it
has limited benefits and alternatives for energy production and regional
development have been presented by many different organizations and experts in
the past years? Why does the government want to displace ten thousands of
people, destroy a culture of 12,000 years and a unique large river ecosystem?""
asks Tasli. ""This is not in line with the ‘democratic initiative' to improve
the situation of the Kurdish people which has been declared by the government
in the last weeks and months. The Ilisu project stands in strong contradiction
with the objectives of this initiative.""     ""We request the government to stop its efforts to find new finance for the
Ilisu Project. The government has to cancel the Ilisu Project before it is too
late. Otherwise our campaign and the discussions will continue in a more
intensive way"", states Ayboga. 
 
 In July 2009, the export credit agencies for Switzerland, Austria and Germany withdrew their guarantees for the Ilisu Dam and Hydroelectric Powerplant Project in Turkey after protests of the affected region’s people and campaigns in West-Turkey and Europe. Immediately following this decision the three European Banks involved (Societe Generale, Bank of Austria and Dekabank) also cancelled their loans for the Ilisu Project. But the European companies of the Ilisu consortium – Andritz from Austria, Zueblin from Germany and Alstom from Switzerland – have not yet announced their withdrawal and the consortium continues to exist.

Rome, Italy ",Eni's new energy projects threaten Congo Rainforest,,, tar sands ,oil and gas,Congo,"
Plans
by oil company Eni to develop tar sands and oil palm in the Congo Basin
risk irreversible damage to biodiversity, local communities and our climate,
and break the company´s own guidelines, according to Congolese human rights
organisations and their international partners. In a report published today, Energy Futures? Eni´s
Investments in tar sands and palm oil in the Congo Basin, the groups argue
that given their potential for local harm and their huge carbon footprint, such
investments should be considered too high risk for Eni or any other energy
company.
This is
the first tar sands exploration in Africa,
while the palm oil project for food and agro-fuels would be one of the largest
on the continent. Eni´s deal was signed in 2008 with the Republic
of Congo (Brazzaville), an oil-rich but poor state with
minimal transparency and respect for human rights. Forests cover two thirds of Congo and are
essential for the livelihoods of local people, as well as a vital carbon sink. Congo's
Government wants to lead on stewarding
the global resource of the Basin, but its record on forest law enforcement
and environmental protection is weak.
Eni is
currently ranked as the world´s
most ""sustainable"" oil company. Most recently, its CEO Paolo
Scaroni urged delegates at the UN Leadership Forum in New York to take action on climate change. Yet
research shows that Eni´s new investments in Congo are not a step down the path
of energy sustainability. ""With less than a month to go to the Copenhagen summit, Eni´s
projects undermine its green credentials. They also highlight the wider costs
of promoting high-carbon, export-driven energy investments - especially in
ecologically sensitive areas with poor governance"", commented Barbara Unmüssig,
President of the Heinrich Böll Foundation.
Eni´s
tar sands exploration is taking place over a huge 1,790 KM2 area. The exact
location of the oil palm plantation is unknown, but it will claim 70,000
hectares of ""unfarmed"" land. Eni says neither project will take place
on rainforest and areas of high biodiversity or involve resettlement of people.
Yet privately, Eni estimates the tar sands zone comprises 50 to 70% rainforest
and other highly environmentally sensitive areas. According to Congolese human rights
activist Brice Mackosso (Justice and Peace Commission, Pointe-Noire):
""Local people, already suffering the impacts of oil development, have not
been meaningfully consulted over the new projects. This violates Eni´s own
human rights and environmental policies"".
In Alberta,
Canada, tar sands development has led to destruction of the boreal forest, air
and water pollution, and health impacts for downstream communities. Producing a
barrel of oil from bitumen is 3 to 5 times higher in greenhouse gas emissions
than conventional oil, and Canadians now have the highest carbon footprint of
any G8 citizens. Equally, monoculture plantations for agro-fuels are a major
source of the deforestation that accounts for 20% of global emissions. Oil palm
cultivation is also linked to increased food insecurity, land conflicts, human rights
abuses and threats to indigenous groups.
""Eni´s
new projects point to a lack of oversight by its key shareholder, the Italian
Government"" states Elena Gerebizza of Italian group Campaign for the Reform
of the World Bank. ""Italy
has a clear responsibility to ensure that investments by Eni consider fully
their likely developmental and climate impacts, and do not work against the
country´s international commitments, such as reducing carbon emissions"".

São Paulo ","Rio Madeira: Comissão Interamericana de Direitos Humanos, da OEA, recebeu denúncia contra as hidrelétricas Santo Antônio e Jirau",,,Rio Madeira dams: Jirau and Santo Antonio ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"

“Ao contrariar frontalmente as aspirações e os direitos das comunidades 
afetadas e dos povos indígenas da Amazônia, das organizações ambientalistas e 
dos movimentos sociais, o Complexo Hidrelétrico do rio Madeira está criando um 
sério precedente que abrirá as portas para outros grandes projetos estruturantes 
na América do Sul que poderão exaurir os recursos naturais necessários à 
sobrevivência dos povos amazônicos”.
“Para manter a riqueza desse patrimônio biológico e das culturas imemoriais 
das comunidades e dos povos indígenas há a necessidade de ações coordenadas, 
harmônicas e integradas dos governos dos países americanos e a intervenção de 
instâncias internacionais como a dessa Comissão, para fazer valer os princípios 
que norteiam os direitos humanos.”

Washington é uma bela cidade.  Eu não a conhecia e quase sucumbi aos seus 
encantos.  Gente feliz, cidade limpa, ruas seguras, aconchego, festas e 
comemorações.  Esse foi o intróito para se chegar à realidade do resto do mundo, 
em especial da América do Sul.  Para o americano médio, essa realidade não 
existe e o conhecimento sobre as violações dos direitos humanos está fora do seu 
alcance.
Várias audiências na Comissão davam conta das denúncias sobre a violação dos 
Direitos Humanos perpetrada por empresas e governos contra povos indígenas, 
populações tradicionais, mulheres e crianças nos países da América Central e do 
Sul.  O Brasil esteve representado na agenda em três audiências.  Uma delas foi 
sobre os grandes projetos hidrelétricos na América do Sul e, lógico, não poderia 
faltar a descrição do projeto de Belo Monte.  Outra foi sobre violações dos 
direitos humanos pedido pela FASE.  E a nossa, sobre os projetos da Iniciativa 
para Integração da Infra-estrutura Sul americana (IIRSA), com o grupo formado 
por dois representantes da Bolívia, um do Peru e eu.
Os líderes indígenas da Bolívia e do Peru denunciaram os impactos dos 
projetos de infra-estrutura e de energia e relataram a acelerada destruição dos 
recursos naturais que afetam a sobrevivência dos povos indígenas.  Representando 
a Associação de Defesa Etnoambiental Kanindé, fiz a denúncia contra o governo 
brasileiro e seus projetos de geração hidrelétrica na Amazônia, em especial a 
construção das usinas Santo Antônio e Jirau, no rio Madeira.  Mencionei os 
impactos sobre terras indígenas, índios isolados, contaminação pelo mercúrio, o 
aumento da malária e o grave episódio da mortandade dos peixes nas obras da 
hidrelétrica Santo Antônio.
Em minha fala referi-me, entre outras coisas, à megalomania do governo 
brasileiro que planeja construir 71 hidrelétricas na Amazônia, 15 no Peru e 3 na 
Bolívia.  Denunciei o processo de licenciamento das usinas do Madeira em que as 
licenças foram concedidas por pressões políticas e os estudos ambientais não 
levaram em consideração todos os impactos sociais e ambientais.
Dois membros da Comissão ficaram surpresos com os fatos que mencionei e 
fizeram perguntas com relação à consulta aos povos indígenas e o deslocamento 
compulsório das populações afetadas.

San Fransisco, United States ",China needs to address environmental challenge in Africa,,,,,,"
On November
8/9, China's and Africa's
governments will meet for the 4th summit of the Forum on
China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in Sharm-el-Sheik,
 Egypt. A report
published by International Rivers finds that China
and Africa have been successful in boosting
their financial and economic cooperation, but have failed to deal seriously
with the environmental challenges that have resulted from their growing cooperation.
The report, China, Africa and the Environment, concludes
that the Chinese government has fulfilled the generous promises of increased cooperation
which it made at the last China-African summit in Beijing in 2006. China
has, for example, almost doubled its assistance to Africa
since 2006, has freed 478 African products from all import tariffs, and has
greatly increased its training and exchange programs for African professionals.
The Chinese approach contrasts with the track record of Western governments,
which have often reneged on their promises of increased support for Africa in recent years. Many Chinese investment projects
go forward in environmentally sensitive sectors and regions however, and don't
always follow international environmental standards.
Peter
Bosshard, the Policy Director of International Rivers, commented: ""The
good news is that China has
lived up to its promise to strengthen cooperation with Africa, and has allowed Africa to reduce its dependence on Western powers. The
bad news is that some Chinese projects have disregarded the rights of local
communities and the environment, and have created tensions over China's role in Africa.
The China-Africa summit provides an opportunity to integrate environmental
concerns into the mainstream of Chinese-African relations."" The report
mentions the Merowe Dam in Sudan
and the proposed Gibe 4 Dam in Ethiopia
as examples of projects which damage the environment and violate the rights of
local communities.
The report by
International Rivers also notes that the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation has
opened the doors to the business sector, but has so far excluded civil society
organizations from its meetings. It proposes that non-governmental
organizations be invited to participate in the follow-up process to the FOCAC
summit, as a way to better integrate environmental concerns into the financial
and economic cooperation.

London ",Top financial institutions still invest US$20 billion in cluster bombs,ANZ ,Australia,Lockheed Martin ,arms industry and trade,United States,"
 
Almost one
year on from the historic signing of the Convention on Cluster Munitions in
Oslo in December 2008, 138 financial institutions still provide over US$ 20
billion worth of investments and financial services to eight producers of
cluster bombs. These are the findings of the most comprehensive report to date
on global financial investments in these banned weapons, ‘Worldwide
investments in cluster munitions; A shared responsibility'. The report
authors are calling public and private financial institutions to support the
ban and disinvest from cluster bomb producers.  
""There is
a clear ethical, business and legal case for financial institutions to
disinvest from cluster munitions and we are calling on them to do so now"" said Roos Boer, from IKV Pax Christi and one of the report authors. ""We
are also calling on states that have signed the Convention on Cluster Munitions
to draw up legislation to ban investments in cluster munitions and to provide
clear guidelines for financial institutions,"" she added.
Since
2007 the human and economic cost arising from the use of cluster munitions have
been widely acknowledged and documented. Like landmines, cluster bombs
have killed and injured thousands of civilians during the last 40 years and
continue to do so long after a conflict has ended. Once the treaty
enters into force, the legal obligations, including the prohibition of
assistance becomes legally binding on all parties to the treaty.
The
publication by IKV Pax Christi and Netwerk Vlaanderen categorizes retail banks,
investment banks, asset management companies and private and public pensions
into a ""Hall of Shame,"" a ""Hall of Fame"" and ""Runners-Up"",
based on their investment policies and practices. The report also looks at
legislative initiatives to prohibit investment in cluster munitions.
Leading in
the Hall of Shame for:

Investment banking services
     to companies producing cluster munitions:
     HSBC, Goldman Sachs, Merril Lynch, Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan Chase
     provided the largest amount of investment banking services since Jan. 2007
Loans to companies producing
     cluster munitions: Twelve of the largest banks
     provided 58% of the loans. Bank of America, Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase,
     Barclays and Goldman Sachs provided the largest amount of loans since
     Jan.  2007
Asset management services
     that invest in companies producing cluster munitions: Fidelity, Vanguard Group, AXA, BlackRock and T Rowe Price Group
     provided the largest asset management services based on their portfolio
     (by summer 2009).

The report
found that since January 2007 at least 138 financial institutions from 16
different countries have invested in eight producers of cluster munitions.
These companies include: Alliant Techsystems ATK (USA), Hanwha (South Korea),
L-3 Communications (USA), Lockheed Martin (USA) Poongsan (South Korea),
Roketsan (Turkey), Singapore Technologies Engineering (Singapore) and Textron
(USA. 
Leading
financial institutions provided the following services and investments to these
eight selected producers of cluster munitions:

Investment banking services
     worth over US$ 4.2 billion.
Loans amounting to at least
     US$ 5 billion
Owned or managed shares and
     bonds for at least US$ 11.8 billion

The Hall
of Fame includes: Government-managed
pension funds, ethical banks and some private financial institutions. The Norwegian
Pension Fund has excluded producers of cluster munitions since 2004. The Irish
National Pensions Reserve Fund, the New Zealand Superannuation Fund and the Swedish Pension Funds AP 7 also top the Hall of Fame, so do the
ethical banks ASN Bank and Triodos Bank of the Netherlands
and Banca Etica of Italy.
Storebrand is one of the private financial institutions listed in the Hall of
Fame. In addition, many private financial institutions have installed a
public policy to end investments and are commended for this by the report
authors.
""National
policies banning investments clearly help, but are not the only solution and
financial institutions must also take action"" said
Esther Vandenbroucke, of Netwerk Vlaanderen and one of the report authors. ""The
responsibility to ban cluster munitions is a shared responsibility. It requires
courage, and it requires an effort. We are just months away from an
international treaty entering into force and it is time for signatory states to
the CCM, for non-signatory states and for financial institutions to act now"", she concluded.

Paris, France ",Victoire Pinocchio : le Crédit Agricole revend ses titres Dongfeng,Crédit Agricole ,France,,,,"
Les Amis de la Terre se félicitent de la vente des actions de la compagnie chinoise Dongfeng par le Crédit Agricole, qui est nominé aux prix Pinocchio 2009. Dongfeng est impliquée dans la vente de 900 camions militaires à la junte birmane en 2008, et a été à ce titre blacklistée par le fonds de pension du gouvernement norvégien. Le désinvestissement du Crédit Agricole reste toutefois partiel, le Crédit Agricole détenant toujours d’autres titres Dongfeng pour compte propre. Les Amis de la Terre demandent au Crédit Agricole et aux autres banques et assurances françaises de cesser toute activité avec ce type d’entreprise controversée.
Le Crédit Agricole a été nominé début octobre pour le prix Pinocchio dans la catégorie « Droits humains » pour son implication dans le financement de l’entreprise Dongfeng . La banque française détenait ou gérait pour compte de tiers des actions de cette entreprise pour un montant de près de 9 millions de dollars. Dongfeng, une des principales compagnies automobiles chinoises, a fournit 900 camions militaires à la junte birmane dans la première moitié de l’année 2008. Cette implication lui a valu d’être blacklistée par le fonds de pension du gouvernement norvégien en début d’année . « La vente des titres Dongfeng détenus pour compte de tiers par le Crédit Agricole à la bourse de Hong-Kong est un pas dans la bonne direction. Le Crédit Agricole reconnaît pour la première fois le comportement irresponsable de l’entreprise Dongfeng et en tire les conséquences concernant son activité de gestion d’actifs pour compte de tiers », commente Yann Louvel, chargé de campagne Finance privée aux Amis de la Terre.
Cette victoire est néanmoins partielle car le Crédit Agricole détient toujours des titres Dongfeng, mais cette fois pour compte propre, au travers de sa gestion indicielle. « Le Crédit Agricole doit également se débarrasser de ces actions qu’il détient pour son propre compte s’il veut être cohérent avec la décision qu’il vient de prendre pour ses clients », demande Sébastien Godinot, coordinateur des campagnes aux Amis de la Terre. « Dongfeng est en effet une entreprise qui viole les droits humains les plus élémentaires en soutenant la junte birmane par ses activités et le Crédit Agricole, comme toutes les banques et assurances françaises, ne doit donc à ce titre plus avoir aucune activité liée à cette entreprise ».
Les Prix Pinocchio soulèvent ainsi la question de la responsabilité des grandes banques et assurances françaises soutenant des entreprises controversées. « La mise en ligne de notre site Internet www.secretsbancaires.fr en juin dernier montre bien que les trois principales banques françaises (BNP Paribas, la Société Générale et le Crédit Agricole), sont impliquées presque systématiquement dans les activités des entreprises les plus irresponsables de la planète telles que Vedanta Resources ou Freeport McMoran. Les banques et assurances françaises ont une co-responsabilité dans les impacts sociaux et environnementaux provoquées par ces entreprises, et elles doivent en tirer toutes les conséquences pour leurs propres activités : elles doivent cesser de leur octroyer des prêts, vendre leurs titres, et refuser de leur assurer des services financiers ».

Sassenberg, Germany ",German energy giant RWE withdraws from Bulgarian nuclear power plant,,,Belene nuclear power plant ,energy plants - nuclear,Bulgaria,"
In a letter to the Bulgarian Energy holding, the German company RWE today announced its withdrawal from the controversial Belene nuclear power plant (NPP) in northern Bulgaria. RWE cites doubts about the project's profitability as the major reason for the company's retreat.
""For the past 18 months, we've been pointing out to RWE that Belene is a high-risk project in terms of safety, economics, environment and corruption,"" says Heffa Schücking from the German environment NGO Urgewald. ""It sure took the company a long time to face up to the facts,"" she comments. RWE's decision comes in the wake of a broad grass-roots campaign of German environment organizations against RWE's investment plans in Belene. Some 30,000 German citizens sent letters and petitions to RWE's CEO asking him to withdraw from the project. Several of the company's major investors also spoke out against the plan to invest into a NPP in an area of high seismicity in a country with low nuclear standards and high corruption.
""This is the beginning of the end of Belene,"" says Greenpeace energy expert Jan Haverkamp. ""After 12 international banks decided to decline financing for the project in 2006 and 2007, RWE was Belene's last hope,"" explains Haverkamp. RWE was slated to provide 49% of the project's equity and its decision to withdraw sends out a clear signal to investors and banks regarding the project's questionable economics.
""This is a huge success for civil society and nuclear safety in Europe,"" says Albena Simeonova from the BeleNE! (No to Belene) Coalition in Bulgaria. Simeonova, who traveled to Germany last spring to speak at RWE's annual shareholder meeting, adds: ""RWE never should have become involved in the crazy plan to build Russian nuclear reactors in an earthquake area. We are happy to hear that they have finally withdrawn from this dangerous project and hope that our own Government will now follow suit.""
Background:
Construction of the Belene nuclear power station started in 1985. From the beginning, there was controversy around the seismic risks as a large earthquake hit the region in 1977 and killed over 120 people only 14 km from the planned NPP site. The project was halted in 1991, and finally dropped in 1992 due to its environmental and economic risks. In 2003, however, the Bulgarian government restarted the project and in 2006, it decided to build two completely new reactors at the Belene site. The tender for construction was won by the Russian firm Atomstroyexport to build an AES-92 nuclear power station with two VVER 1000/466B reactors. This is a first of a kind reactor that has no operational record elsewhere in the world. The new Bulgarian government, which came to power in July 2009, is currently re- evaluating the project. Although it has also raised doubts concerning the project's economic feasibility, the current government has nonetheless commissioned a consultant to help private investors for Belene.
Belene is estimated to cost around 10 billion Euros. In 2006, Deutsche Bank, UniCredit and 10 further large commercial banks all turned down applications to finance the project. In 2008 and 2009, several large energy companies also turned down invitations to become investors into the project.

",115 Civil Society Groups Urge China to Suspend Disastrous Pipelines in Burma,,,Shwe gas and pipelines projects ,oil and gas,Myanmar,"
115 civil society organizations and political parties from 20 countries today submitted an open letter to China's President Hu Jintao calling for the suspension of oil and gas pipelines through Burma in order to prevent rights abuses and regional instability, avoiding financial and image risks to China.  Petitions were submitted by the Shwe Gas Movement and its solidarity networks at Chinese Embassies in Thailand, India, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Malaysia, Australia, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands and the UK.
State-owned China National Petroleum Corporation holds a majority stake in the construction of dual oil and gas pipelines which will transfer oil shipped from the Middle East and Africa as well as natural gas from the Shwe Gas fields in western Burma to China's Yunnan Province. The project will provide the military junta a minimum of 29 billion US dollars over 30 years.
Abuses are already starting to surface in the project area, including beatings of fishermen and fishing prohibitions in the offshore drilling area as well as confiscation of land at the start of the pipeline in Arakan State.
Burma ranks tenth in the world in terms of natural gas reserves yet its per capita electricity consumption is less than 5% of neighbouring Thailand and China, as it exports most of its energyresources. Increased fuel prices led to country-wide demonstrations in 2007, which were cracked down upon by the Burma Army.
""Land confiscation and other human rights abuses in the pipeline corridor and exporting the oil and gas while people across the country is facing energy shortages is a dangerous mix that will cause social unrest and conflicts between local people and foreign corporations, says Wong Aung, International Coordinator of Shwe Gas Movement.
Unresolved conflicts between the Burma regime and ethnic ceasefire armies along the planned pipeline route in northern Shan State led to a military offensive by the Burma Army in August forcing over thirty thousand ethnic Kokang to escape to China.
Last month the Danish Pension Fund Danica Pension blacklisted one of the main stakeholders in the Shwe project, Daewoo International, citing a ""breach of international guidelines in connection with its activities in Burma."" Other pension funds are reported to be monitoring the corporations involved in the Shwe gas pipelines project.
""China has the power to suspend this project, and rather that being part of the problem, becoming part of a long-term solution by promoting equitable development of the people of the two nations and peace in the region,"" says Kim , Shwe Gas Movement ,India. "

London ",High Court decision: Treasury can ignore climate change and human rights,Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS)  ,United Kingdom,Vedanta Resources ,mining - non coal,United Kingdom,"
A High Court judge today blocked a request for permission to hold a Judicial Review over what campaigners say is the Treasury's lack of adequate environmental and human rights consideration of Royal Bank of Scotland's investments. Campaigners from the World Development Movement, PLATFORM and People
& Planet, who brought the case against the Treasury expressed
‘disappointment' at the ruling and have decided to appeal this decision.
Deborah Doane, the director
of the World Development Movement said,
""We're incredibly disappointed with the court's decision not to allow a
full hearing on this important case and will be appealing the judgement. Essentially,
the judgement means that RBS' profits come before the climate and human rights
of people.This is particularly hard to swallow after Gordon Brown's soaring
rhetoric on climate change yesterday. We're incredibly angry to see that just
one day later the Treasury outrageously argued that for a director of business
to take environmental concerns into account would be a ‘burden' and
‘handicapping'. Yet, this is precisely the kind of positive action that the
government should be promotoing, if we are to believe one word of Gordon Brown's
speech yesterday.
The lawyers acting on behalf of the groups laid out compelling evidence
against the Treasury, citing numerous controversial companies and projects that
the bank had used public money to finance. It was also argued that as a
majority shareholder in the bailed-out bank, the Treasury misdirected itself in
relation to the legal obligations concerning communities and the environment
under the Companies Act.
Rosa Curling, solicitor for
Leigh Day said:
""This is clearly a disappointing result and we have advised our clients
to appeal this decision. The government has set up an obligation for all
government bodies to assess the environmental consequences of its decision and
projects and it has failed to do so in relation to the management of RBS
investments.""
Mel Evans, climate and
finance campaigner for PLATFORM said,
""Despite this ruling, we still firmly believe that taxpayers' money
should not be used by RBS to underwrite loans that undermine Britain's
domestic and international commitments to halt climate change and human rights
abuses. These include companies such as Vedanta Resources, which last week was
criticised by the government itself for failing to respect the rights of
indigenous people in India; and Tullow Oil, which is involved in oil
exploration and extraction on the border between Uganda and the Democratic
Republic of Congo where a civil war driven by a struggle over land and
resources has led to widespead displacement.""
Ian Leggett, director of
People & Planet said,
""People & Planet is a network of students and young people. We
decided to take the Treasury to court because they are allowing RBS to drive
projects endangering our future. This government has given itself a clear legal
duty to assess the impacts of its spending on the climate change which
threatens young people and future generations. We believe they have failed in
this duty, and we will appeal today's flawed and dangerous decision.""

London ",Unprecedented legal battle over RBS' unethical investments,Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS)  ,United Kingdom,Vedanta Resources ,mining - non coal,United Kingdom,"
Today, an unprecedented legal battle will take place in the High Court over the Treasury's failure to stop the publicly owned Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) investing in what campaigners describe as 'some of the most environmentally damaging and socially irresponsible projects and companies around.
The case is being brought by three small climate and social justice campaigning groups: PLATFORM, People & Planet and the World Development Movement, which has led some commentators to bill it as a 'ground breaking, David and Goliath case'.
Today's oral hearing will determine whether their claim can proceed to a full substantive hearing, likely to take place early next year. The Treasury has hired one of its top barristers, James Eadie QC, to handle the case but the campaigners are optimistic that they will be successful: Deborah Doane, director of the World Development Movement said:
""This is a classic David and Goliath battle. But we believe we have a strong case. The Treasury's decision to allow RBS to continue to invest in companies that exacerbate climate change and are linked to human rights abuses is unlawful, immoral and undemocratic. Hopefully, this case will be a pivotal point in ending RBS' destructive lending habits that go against the interests of UK taxpayers, the climate and people whose human rights are being violated.
The campaigners are represented by the leading human rights law firm Leigh Day & Co and the solicitor working on the case, Rosa Curling said:
""The legal challenge has already resulted in a significant victory for the campaign groups. The Treasury, having strenuously resisted any suggestion that it should consider applying environmental and human rights standards to RBS, has now conceded that it does have to, and has undertaken an assessment on whether such standards should be imposed. The Treasury has decided it should not. When it comes to climate change and human rights, it has decided it should not go beyond what is narrowly in the interest of RBS. However, this conclusion is unlawful. It is based on a misunderstanding of the law and flies in the face of the government's wider policies on corporate social responsibility and climate change.
The hearing coincides with the release of an independent report that finds the financial value of RBS to taxpayers is best served by requiring the bank to phase out investment in fossil fuels. The report, 'Towards a Royal Bank of Sustainability: protecting taxpayers' interests; cutting carbon risk' argues that UKFI, the company set up to manage the government's shares in the bailed-out banks, should take an 'active ownership' approach to its investments with respect to environmental and social issues. This is consistent with best practice and  legislation which has been developed over a number of years by institutional investors and the government.
Mel
Evans, finance and climate campaigner from PLATFORM said:
""The court case today is clearly showing the legal reasons why the Treasury under the Company Law Act must take action to stop RBS from investing in companies that trash the climate. But there's also a business case which is demonstrated in this new report. In an increasingly carbon-constrained world, investors, and in this case, the public as owners of RBS, are exposing themselves to more and more risk in continuing to pump billions into new fossil
fuel projects.""
The campaigners have calculated that the carbon emissions traced back to RBS'investments in fossil fuel projects are equivalent to the annual emissions of Scotland, or Bangladesh a country of over 150 million people, who are facing huge devastation from climate change.
An example of the company and projects that RBS helps to finance is the controversial
London-based mining company, Vedanta Resources. After RBS was bailed out, its subsidiary ABN-Amro acted as the lead financial advisor for Vedanta's Indian
subsidiary, Sterlite in its takeover bid of Asarco in March 2009. Recently, it has been reported that over 100 people were killed in a Vedanta mine in India due to alleged lack of concern over health and safety for the workers, and the UK government last week criticised the company over the human rights of indigenous people when planning to construct a new open cast mine. The
campaigners point to this as an example of the chasm between government rhetoric and action.
Ian Leggett, director of People & Planet said: ""Taxpayers have already had to pick up the tab for bailing out RBS for its irresponsible lending. Yet if the government allows it to carry on investing in projects and companies in the certain knowledge that such  investments will accelerate climate change, we will have to pick up an even bigger tab in the future. Investing in high carbon projects is not in shareholders' and taxpayers' interests and the sooner RBS stops supporting climate damaging projects the better.""
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes to editors:  The court hearing will take place at the High Court of Justice, The Strand. The time of the hearing is not made public until Monday 19 October.
The report 'Towards a Royal Bank of Sustainability: protecting taxpayers'interests; cutting carbon risk' has been commissioned and contributed to by Friends of the Earth Scotland, PLATFORM, BankTrack, People & Planet, Investor watch, Landman Economics and the World Development Movement. It has been written by Nick Silver, an independent consulting
actuary. He is an honorary senior visiting fellow at CASS Business School and chairman of the actuarial profession´s Resource and Environment Group.
The foreword has been written by Dr. Craig Mackenzie, Director of the Centre for Business and Climate Change, University of Edinburgh Business School.
The report can be found here
In March 2009, RBS was the lead financial advisor to Sterlite (60% owned by Vedanta)in the company´s bid to take over Asarco; the proposed acquisition is backed by two letters of credit from RBS/ABN-Amro to the tune of US$ 100 million, RBS participated in a loan to Vedanta plc which apart from being the worst of the large London-based mining companies in terms of human rights violations, poor corporate governance and violation of laws, is also constructing a thermal coal power station to power one of its Indian bauxite operations; and a chimney collapse at the construction site recently killed up to 100 workers because of the alleged appalling lack of attention to safety. See the London Mining Network press release at
http://londonminingnetwork.org/2009/09/korba%E2%80%99s-killing-field
Vedanta has also come under fire from the British government in an unprecedented attack on a FTSE 100 company, the government ruled that Vedanta ""did not respect the rights"" of the area's indigenous people; ""did not consider the impact of the construction of the mine on the  rights""; and ""failed to put in place an adequate and timely consultation mechanism"". The report concluded that a change in the company's behaviour' was ""essential"".
http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/oct/12/government-criticises-mining-company-vedanta
PLATFORM has calculated that the embedded emissions from project finance attributable to RBS was 44 million tonnes of CO2 in 2006. This is just over Scotland's total emissions of 43 million tonnes in 2007 - Greenhouse Gas Inventories for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland: 1990 €2007, AEA Technology report for Department of Energy and Climate Change, The Scottish Government, The Welsh Assembly Government, The Northern Ireland Department of Environment.
http://www.airquality.co.uk/reports/
RBS' 44 million tonnes of CO2 is also equivalent to Bangladesh which emitted 39 million tonnes in 2006 according to the Energy Information Agency.
Take action info:
Since its bail out, RBS has taken part in an estimated £10 billion in loans to coal,
oil and gas companies including: £6 billion to controversial energy giant E.ON
In January 2009, RBS helped raise £400 million for the Irish company Tullow Oil, and in March 2009 RBS was part of a consortium of 14 banks that lent £1.4 billion to Tullow Oil. Tullow Oil is involved in the exploration and extraction of oil on the border between Uganda
and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This area has seen some of the fiercest fighting in an extractive resource-driven civil war as rival armies and militias have struggled for control of the land, leading to thousands of civilian deaths and refugees.
RBS has helped to raise £116 million for Cairn Energy, a Scottish oil company, to be used for 'accelerated drilling' in arctic Greenland.

Sakhalin Environment Watch sent a letter to the Sakhalin Region branches of the Russian Technical Oversight Agency Rostekhnadzor) and Federal Service for the Supervision of Natural Resource Use (Rosprirodnadzor) with a request to not to use the main Sakhalin-II pipelines. This request came after public inspections once more revealed violations that increase the risk of oil spills.
Sakhalin Environment Watch and experts from the Far Eastern Branch of the Russian
Academy of Sciences Far East Geological Institute examined Sakhalin Energy’s pipeline routes several times in May-September 2009 and detected hazardous geological processes. These
include rain-induced landslides and mudflows along the pipeline route, which traverses several river valleys in the Makarov and Poronaisk districts. Due to flooding and soil erosion, a 10-meter section of an underground oil pipe was exposed on the Gornaya River. Mudflows on the slopes of the Zhdanko Ridge in the Travyanaya River basin, a critical salmon spawning area, a gaping 1.5 meter-deep gully has formed in the pipeline route.
On September 27-28, 2009, representatives from our organization conducted the fourth landslide and erosion control inspection in six months along the Sakhalin-II project pipeline routes in the Makarovskiy District. We determined that continued erosion along Travyanaya River
tributaries and lack of adequate erosion measures in this area have resulted in increased ravine depth (3.2 meters) under gas and oil pipes. On the Solyanka River, floods are eroding the banks and sweeping coastal protection structures into the current. Coastal protection structures have been installed along approximately 30 meters of the riverbank. Nothing has changed since our first visit to this site in May 2009; no measures have been taken to restore the integrity of these structures. Erosion has formed a 1.2-1.5 meter-deep ravine on the Gar River that causes coastal protection structures to deformation and distortion. Further along the pipeline route, a bare fiber optic cable – part of the oil and gas pipeline flow control system – sags over the river channel.
In early August, the Sakhalin Rosprirodnadzor inspected the Sakhalin II project pipeline and identified a number of violations. Consequently, the administration issued an injunction requiring Sakhalin Energy to fix the violations; however, public environmental inspections revealed that two months later, most of the violations had not been eliminated. As of September 28, of all rivers where Sakhalin Environment Watch staff observed dangerous geological processes, only the Gornaya River area crossing has been restored.
Sakhalin-II pipelines cross hundreds of spawning rivers while pumping millions of tons of oil and billions of cubic meters of natural gas under high pressure. Lack of sufficient protection from developing hazardous geological processes creates a high risk of damage to pipelines and, as a result, oil spill or gas leak. Despite the actual operation of pipelines and oil and LNG (liquefied natural gas) export throughout the year, Rostekhnadzor has not yet issued a certificate of approval stating that constructed facility meets technical regulation requirements, which means it may not be operated.
Rostekhnadzor recently announced the results of an investigation into the cause of the accident at the Sayano-Shushenskaya power plant, which operated for 21 years without receiving the technical regulation certification required for operation. The relevant certificate of approval was signed only in 2000, and contained many adjustments that still needed to be modified when the turbine hall flooded in August 2009, tragically killing 75. This example creates great concern for the safety of Sakhalin-II project industrial facilities, which have been operating for the past year without this safety certification. Moreover, the risks of technological accidents along the pipeline are increasing, yet the project operator fails to take adequate measures.
Environmentalists hope that the government authorities will do everything possible to bring the Sakhalin-II pipelines in line with statutory requirements. Sakhalin Environment Watch will continue monitoring the situation on the pipeline route. "

EPR : Les banques françaises portent à bout de bras un fiasco industriel
Nos campagnes  > Responsabilité des acteurs financiers  > Finance et Energie - climat  > Projets controversés  > Nucléaire  > EPR 
16 octobre 2009,

Par Yann Louvel

Malgré les dernières révélations intervenues ce jeudi au sujet de l’EPR finlandais, les banques françaises s’obstinent à vouloir financer un projet d’EPR en Inde, nous enfermant toujours un peu plus dans la fuite en avant nucléaire. Alors que TVO vient d’annoncer que l’EPR finlandais ne serait mis en service qu’en 2013 et que l’autorité de sûreté nucléaire finlandaise (STUK) a ordonné l’arrêt des travaux de soudure sur le chantier, les Amis de la Terre, Greenpeace et le Réseau Sortir du Nucléaire demandent aux banques françaises (BNP Paribas, Société Générale, Crédit Agricole et Natixis) de cesser immédiatement leurs pourparlers avec l’Inde et de se mettre enfin à financer les réelles solutions aux crises climatiques et énergétiques : l’efficacité énergétique et les énergies renouvelables.

La presse indienne a évoqué hier pour la première fois les sources potentielles de financement des EPR envisagés dans ce pays. On y apprend ainsi que la Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) est en pourparlers avec quatre banques françaises : BNP Paribas, Société Générale, Crédit Agricole et Natixis, et une banque anglaise, HSBC, pour le financement de la construction de deux EPR (1). Yann Louvel, chargé de campagne Finance privée aux Amis de la Terre, commente cette information : « On retrouve là les mêmes ""usual suspects"" que pour la majorité des projets controversés dans lesquels des banques françaises sont impliquées. BNP Paribas s’était déjà brillamment illustré pour son implication dans le projet de centrale nucléaire en zone sismique de Belene, en Bulgarie, et la Société Générale et le Crédit Agricole dans celui de Mochovce, en Slovaquie, deux projets obsolètes toujours pas opérationnels après 20 ans de tergiversations ».
Cette nouvelle intervient alors que le premier projet de construction d’EPR, à Olkiluoto, en Finlande, se transforme chaque jour un peu plus en fiasco industriel et financier, comme le précise Stéphane Lhomme, du Réseau ""Sortir du nucléaire"" : « Le chantier du premier EPR a déjà pris quatre ans de retard. La centrale devait entrer en fonction en 2009 alors que les dernières prévisions ont été repoussées à 2013 ! De même, sur le plan financier, AREVA avait vendu le projet aux Finlandais pour 3 milliards d’euros, mais nous en sommes déjà rendus à 5,5 milliards d’euros, soit un surcoût de plus de 80% ! Tout cela est dû aux multiples problèmes rencontrés sur le site, ce qui prouve bien que cette nouvelle génération de réacteur n’est qu’un miroir aux alouettes, comme l’est le nucléaire en tant que solution aux crises climatiques et énergétiques ».
Laura Hameaux, de Greenpeace France, conclut : « Les banques françaises ont assez fait parler d’elles avec la crise financière et les multiples scandales, ainsi que par leur implication dans de nombreux projets controversés aux impacts environnementaux et sociaux désastreux. Elles doivent immédiatement stopper leurs discussions avec NPCIL et cesser de détourner des capitaux vers ce type de fausses solutions pour se mettre enfin à financer les réelles solutions aux changements climatiques : l’efficacité énergétique et les énergies renouvelables ».

London ",G20 takes welcome step to stop banks fuelling corruption,,,,,,"
 

The G20 has urged an international watchdog on anti-money laundering laws to prioritise the fight against corrupt funds, a move warmly welcomed by anti-corruption group Global Witness today.
Anti-money laundering laws, which should prevent banks accepting illegally-earned funds, are the key defence against the movement of state funds that have been looted by corrupt government officials. So they are vital in tackling poverty in developing countries.
The inter-governmental body that sets the standard for anti-money laundering laws, and evaluates each country to check if its laws are up to scratch, is the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Since 2001 it has been heavily focused on using the anti-money laundering laws as a bulwark against the movement of terrorist finance. This has largely been effective: banks are now checking to ensure their customers are not on terrorist watch lists. But until now there has been little comparable political will to ensure that banks avoid the proceeds of corruption.
""The G20's call for a focus on corruption provides some of the necessary political will that has been lacking. Our investigations have shown that banks do not always take this seriously enough, and one reason is that they are not hearing a strong message from governments that they must do so. The taskforce meets in Paris next month; that meeting will be a decisive next step in this process, as it will now have to decide how to make the anti-money laundering laws more effective,"" said Anthea Lawson, a campaigner for Global Witness.
""State looting has a devastating effect on developing countries. Efforts to lift people out of poverty and lessen dependence on aid are undermined by banks' keenness to do business with corrupt officials. Let's be clear: corruption could not occur without the help of the international financial system - the amounts being stolen are too big to keep under the mattress,"" Lawson added.
Notes to editors:
1. The G20's communiqué  from its Pittsburgh summit on Friday said: ""We ask the FATF to help detect and deter the proceeds of corruption by prioritizing work to strengthen standards on customer due diligence, beneficial ownership and transparency."" (Paragraph 42 of main text)
2. ‘Customer due diligence' is the process that banks must undertake to identify who they are dealing with and the source of their funds. ‘Beneficial ownership' refers to the need for banks to identify the ultimate owner of the funds, as opposed to the shell companies and/or trusts which may be used to obscure the owner's identity. ‘Transparency' refers to the need for more information to be made available about the beneficial ownership of such corporate vehicles, which are used to hide all forms of illicit money, whether they be corrupt, evading tax, or the proceeds of other forms of criminal activity.
3. Earlier this year a Global Witness report, Undue Diligence: How banks do business with corrupt regimes , detailed how major banks including Barclays, HSBC, Deutsche Bank and Citibank were facilitating corruption through doing business with dubious customers in corrupt, natural resource-rich states. It showed how the current laws are ambiguous about how far banks must go to identify the real person behind a series of front companies and trusts; fail to be explicit about how banks should handle natural resource revenues when they may be fuelling corruption; and may permit a bank to fulfil the letter of its legal obligations, yet still do business with dubious customers.

Washington DC ",Report warns of dangers in carbon markets,,,,,,"
As world leaders gather for the G20 economic summit in Pittsburgh
this week, Friends of the Earth U.S. released a report warning that the carbon
trading system envisioned by the United States is complex, volatile
and prone to gaming.
The report, 'Simpler, Smaller and More Stable' finds that
current proposals to regulate derivatives are necessary, but far from
sufficient to ensure the environmental and financial integrity of these new
markets. 
However, in its draft paper on carbon markets and private
finance prepared for the G20 Summit, the G20 Experts Group on Climate Change
Financing has come out strongly in favor of a global market in carbon.
""It is reckless to push for a global carbon derivatives
market when we don't have anything even close to a global system for regulating
conventional derivatives,"" said Michelle Chan, author of the Friends of the
Earth report. 
Moreover, the Friends of the Earth report points out that U.S.
policymakers have designed a carbon trading system that is inherently difficult
to regulate.  For example, the climate change bill which passed the U.S.
House of Representatives allows some 30% of carbon traded in the U.S. to be from
carbon offset credits.  The G20 climate paper likewise makes several
recommendations on how to expand the international market for carbon offsets.
""Most carbon offset credits will likely be traded as
over-the-counter derivatives. These derivatives played a significant role in
the financial crisis, and are some of the most difficult financial instruments
to govern,"" said Chan. ""Not only does this create regulatory risks, but it also
opens the door wide to subprime carbon: derivatives that promise to deliver
carbon emissions reductions, but may not materialize and could collapse in value.""

Anchorage, Alaska ",Poll finds Bristol Bay residents favor subsistence over Pebble Mine,,,Pebble gold-copper mine ,mining - non coal,United States,"
A new poll released today finds an overwhelming majority of Bristol Bay residents strongly prefer their subsistence lifestyle to the promise of jobs at the proposed Pebble Mine.
The poll, which is the most in-depth survey of local Alaska Natives’ opinion on the Pebble Mine, found that 79 percent of respondents believe the mine, located in the headwaters of two of the region’s largest salmon-spawning rivers, would damage Bristol Bay’s wild salmon fishery – a key resource that many residents depend on for income and food.
“What Anglo American’s CEO told us when we met in London earlier this year was that if local communities did not want Pebble mine, then Anglo American would not build it,” said Bobby Andrew, spokesperson for Nunamta Aulukestai, a coalition of eight village corporations that commissioned the survey. “A majority of local people know the mine will pollute and destroy subsistence, commercial and sport fishing and adamantly oppose it.
“We are asking Anglo American to honor its promise and withdraw from the Pebble project,” Andrew said. Andrew and the three other local Alaskans who met with Anglo American executives and shareholders earlier this year in London sent a letter today to the company’s CEO, Cynthia Carroll, along with the survey results. They asked her to adhere to promises she made in a private meeting that the company would abandon the Pebble project if local communities rejected it.
The letter dated September 22, 2009, stated: “Opposition to the mine is overwhelming and unwavering despite significant outreach efforts by Anglo American and Northern Dynasty over the years…. With that in mind, we ask you to keep your stated commitment to forego development of the Pebble mine given the ongoing community opposition.” “We are not going to risk our subsistence way of life, which has sustained our families for generations, on the Pebble Mine,” said Lydia Olympic, an Igiugig native who joined the group that met with top company officials in London in April. “Mining is not the answer.
“Sustainable development can only be based on our wild salmon, clean water, and renewable energy – not on a mine that will pollute our land and water with toxic waste,” Olympic said.
The poll released today was conducted by Anchorage-based Craciun Research, which sampled 411 Bristol Bay residents from six parts of the Bristol Bay region between May 18, 2009 and June 2, 2009. It was statistically drawn to get an accurate assessment of opinion in each of those areas: Alaska Peninsula, Lake Iliamna/Lake Clark, Nushagak Bay, Nushagak River, Togiak, and Kwichak Bay. The margin of error was plus or minus 4.8 percent.
Among the survey’s main findings:
• The vast majority of residents favored renewable energy development (94 percent), value-added fish packing (89 percent), and tourism that Alaska Native communities could be involved (82 percent) in over mining.
• Survey respondents agreed almost unanimously (97 percent) that maintaining subsistence lifestyle resources and their subsistence lifestyle is important.
• Seventy-two percent of those surveyed reported that a significant part of their diet came from fish, game, berries and other subsistence sources.
• Only 8 percent of survey respondents supported the Pebble mine project, less than the one-third the number that support oil and gas drilling.
• The strongest opposition to the mine was in the Nushagak Bay area, but even in Iliamna-Lake Clark area, where local businesses benefit more from current exploration activities, 73 percent of survey respondents oppose the mine.
• A majority (78 percent) thought Pebble mine would damage commercial, guided or subsistence fishing.
• A majority of respondents agreed that most jobs created by the mine would go to outsiders, not locals.
• Few respondents thought that mining could be done without harming the environment.

Zurich ",Last call for the meaniest companies of the year,,,,,,"
If you hadn't
time yet to propose this year's worst corporations and green washer, do it
now. Due to many requests we moved the deadline for submissions to 24 September.
So take this last chance to tip us off
- and maybe we'll meet in Davos.
Dear
Colleagues
It's that
time of the year again: Berne Declaration and Greenpeace Switzerland are looking
for companies whose social or ecological comportment stinks to high heaven. And
we need you to tip us off about instances of workplace exploitation,
environmental scandal, union busting, or other „worst practices"" in corporate responsibility. On the sidelines of
the World Economic Forum (WEF) in late January 2010, the nastiest companies and
their leaders will be pilloried on the brightly lit Public Eye stage.
Companies
that make our shortlist feel the pressure and participating NGOs get new energy
for their campaigns, because we make effective use of the worldwide media attention focused on Davos. Take Bernische
Kraftwerke AG, winner of the Public Eye Swiss Award 2009: the company has
reduced its share in the destructive coal power plant in Dörpen, northern
Germany, from 100 to 25 percent and no longer leads the project. And also after
Davos, last year's Global Award recipient Newmont Mining indefinitely postponed
its decision to set up a new and very controversial goldmine in Ghana.
We want
the „Public Eye Awards 2010"" to be as successful as the previous years' event
and invite you to give your campaign against corporate wrongdoing the publicity
it deserves. Again, we are looking for companies that are causing social and/or environmental damage in specific
and well-documented instances - companies that look like they have a good
chance of winning the
·        
„GLOBAL AWARD"" (including all 1000 WEF-member corporations)
·        
„SWISS AWARD"" (large to small-size
companies based in Switzerland)
In addition to these two geography-based categories,
we will also present the first ever
·        
„GREENWASH AWARD"" (most questionable
eco predicate or social award)
for private, public, or international institutions
that falsely certify or label environmental culprits and people exploiters as
„green"" or „valuable"". Potential candidates for this new award include rating
agencies, label organizations, industry associations as well as media
organizations that use especially weak or hokey criteria to evaluate the
„social responsibility"" of corporate actors.
Three awards, three
opportunities: tell us who you nominate and why that company or institution
deserves to win one of the Public Eye Awards. The easiest way to do this is by
answering the following questions (optional):
Name and
size of the company? Where is it legally based?
Which of its
activities do you consider socially and/or environmentally irresponsible? What
means and methods does the company use in the process?
What effects
do the company's activities have on humans and on the environment? What are the
actual environmental and/or social consequences of its behavior?
Describe the
current state of your campaign. What happens next?
How do you
want the nominated company to change, what actions are you expecting from third
parties?
Where on the
internet is more information available about your case?
Be sure: It pays to participate! Nominators of an
award winning company receive an exclusive
invitation to the renowned alternative event in Davos (and a whole lot of
publicity for their cause).
Send nominations by e-mail to info@publiceye.ch
The deadline for
nominations is September 17, 2009.
More infos at
www.publiceye.ch or from Oliver Classen,
phone  +41 (0)44 277 70 06.
Well then: on your marks, ready, set, go, Davos!
Thank you for participating and spreading the word.

do Trabalho (MPT) e Ministério do Trabalho e Emprego (MTE) em Rondônia, com 
apoio da Polícia Federal (PF), 38 pessoas arregimentadas no Estado do Maranhão 
(em Parnarama) para trabalharem para a Construtora BS, em Jacy Paraná foram resgatadas e 
tiveram seus contratos de trabalho rescindidos indiretamente.A 
fiscalização constatou que a arregimentação ocorreu de forma irregular e que a 
empresa mantinha os obreiros alojados em condições degradante, contrárias às 
normas de proteção à saúde e segurança do trabalho.A Construtora BS 
presta serviço ao consórcio que constrói a Usina Hidrelétrica de Jirau e executa 
obras de construção da nova Vila Mutum, para onde serão transferidos as famílias 
que residem no local onde será formado o lago da usina.Os trabalhadores 
foram recrutados pela empresa através de “gatos” (pessoas que intermediam as 
contratações mediante pagamento pelo trabalhador) com a promessa de receberem 
salários entre R$ 650 
a R$ 1.200,00, mas na carteira de trabalho foi anotado 
apenas um salário mínimo.  Muitos trabalhadores se endividaram ao fazer 
empréstimos com terceiros para pagar ao aliciador e custear as despesas com a

",Ribeirinhos dizem que peixes estão desaparecendo do rio Madeira por conta da construção das usinas,,,Rio Madeira dams: Jirau and Santo Antonio ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"

Membros da comunidade ribeirinha 
que vivem as margens do rio Madeira, entre as construções das Usinas de Santo 
Antônio e Jirau, em contato com a reportagem do Rondoniaovivo.com disseram que 
peixes tradicionais do rio Madeira, como Mandi, Pacu e Bico de Pato estão 
desaparecendo e prejudicando o modo de vida daquela 
comunidade.
O pescador Álvaro Pires Pinto, que 
não quis ter sua imagem divulgada, com medo de represálias, informou aos 
repórteres do Rondoniaovivo.com que pesca há muito tempo nas proximidades da 
antiga cachoeira de Santo Antônio e percebeu a mudança radical que tomou conta 
do habitat natural da localidade com a escassez de 
pescado.
“Quando não tinha essa construção 
das usinas muitos pescadores conseguiam bastante peixes e distribuíam para toda 
a comunidade daqui do ribeirinho.  Hoje, nem na boca da noite, quando o tempo 
está mais tranqüilo para pesca, a gente não consegue nada.  Afetou muito nossa 
vida, pois vivemos e comemos da pesca.  Sem peixe, não sabemos o que fazer”, 
disse Álvaro.
Para os pescadores da beira do rio 
Madeira a degradação ambiental que pode resultar no desaparecimento de várias 
espécies de pescado está ligada as explosões e implosões que ocorrem nos 
canteiros de obras das usinas, o que acaba afetando o 
ecossistema.
“O engraçado é que no início deste 
mês de setembro, o Ministério da Pesca lançou uma campanha, incentivando o 
consumo de pescado na mesa do brasileiro, mas mal sabe o Ministério sobre a 
escassez de peixe no rio Madeira”, disse um morador tradicional de Porto Velho, 
o policial civil federal aposentado Luiz Gonzaga.
PROSTITUIÇÃO
Outros ribeirinhos e pescadores das 
localidades de Santo Antônio e Jirau, denunciaram um segundo problema, sendo 
este, sobre a violência e prostituição que vem ocorrendo em ambas as construções 
das usinas que está trazendo medo para as comunidades que viviam tranqüilas em 
meio a natureza.
“Ninguém fala nada e nem comenta, 
mas são coisas como essas que estão acontecendo por causa das construções.  A 
prostituição toma conta em alguns pontos, pois criou-se um comércio de sexo para 
atender gente que trabalha nessas obras.  Não tô falando nenhuma novidade, pode 
mandar as autoridades visitar as comunidades”, disse um morador, que pediu para 
não ser identificado.
MAPEAMENTO
Em contato com a Coordenadoria de 
Educação Ambiental do Estado de Rondônia, a reportagem foi informada que na 
quarta-feira (09) técnicos da Caerd (Companhia de Águas e Esgotos de Rondônia) e 
da SEDAM (Secretaria de Desenvolvimento Ambiental de Rondônia) realizaram uma 
reunião para discutir com os ribeirinhos sobre a pesca predatória.  No entanto, 
na manhã desta quinta-feira (10) os Coordenadores de Educação Ambiental se 
reuniram com a comunidade do Bate-Estaca,onde pretendem fazer um levantamento 
ambiental na área e depois será elaborado um plano de ação para comunidade, com 
um mapeamento.

São Paulo ",Malária aumenta 63% em distrito de Porto Velho por causa de construção de usinas,,,Rio Madeira dams: Jirau and Santo Antonio ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"

A construção da Usina Hidrelétrica de Jirau, no Rio Madeira (RO), fez com que o 
número de casos de malária no distrito de Jaci-Paraná aumentasse 63,6%. De 
acordo com o Departamento de Vigilância Epidemiológica e Ambiental de Porto 
Velho, de janeiro a julho de 2008 foram registrados 931 casos de malária na 
localidade e, no mesmo período deste ano, o número subiu para 1.524. 
Segundo a diretora do departamento, 
Rute Bessa, os números podem ser explicados pelo aumento da população do 
distrito, que praticamente triplicou desde o início das obras da hidrelétrica. 
""As pessoas que trabalham na Hidrelétrica de Santo Antônio , devido à proximidade, moram na cidade. Em Jaci Paraná, os trabalhadores da 
hidrelétrica de Jirau ficam num alojamento no local das obras, então acabou 
aumentando muito a população do distrito"", explicou. Jaci-Paraná fica a cerca de 
60 
quilômetros de Porto Velho. 
A diretora ressaltou ainda que, 
apesar da expansão da doença no distrito, em todo o município de Porto Velho 
houve uma redução de cerca de 9% nos casos de malária, se comparados os 
primeiros sete meses do ano passado com o mesmo período deste ano. De janeiro a 
julho de 2008 foram registrados 12,8 mil casos, e neste ano foram 11,6 mil 
registros da doença. 
A Energia Sustentável, 
concessionária responsável pela Usina de Jirau, informou que realiza 
sistematicamente ações de educação em saúde e mobilização social para informar 
os trabalhadores e a população sobre a doença. Também são desenvolvidas ações 
preventivas como treinamento da equipe de controle vetorial, levantamento dos 
criadouros, pesquisa de larvárias, triagem com os trabalhadores, e borrificações 
nos alojamentos. 
A empresa garante que tem um 
rigoroso controle de saúde dos trabalhadores, e que todas as pessoas que têm 
acesso ao canteiro de obras devem usar botas, capacete e camisas de manga 
comprida. Além disso, dos R$ 17 milhões que estão sendo investidos na saúde, 
mais de R$ 5 milhões são destinados exclusivamente ao Plano de Ação para o 
Controle da Malária. 
Rute Bessa lembra que o plano, que 
prevê ações para os cinco anos de construção das usinas, ainda está no início do 
desenvolvimento, e o município está trabalhando com os próprios recursos. ""Temos 
uma relação harmônica, de trabalho conjunto, mas sabemos que precisa fazer muito 
mais para barrar o crescimento da malária no município"", afirmou. 
O aumento de casos de malária 
em Porto 
Velho foi uma preocupação desde o início dos debates sobre a 
construção das hidrelétricas do Rio Madeira. A região registra números 
expressivos da doença, devido às suas condições climáticas e geográficas, e a 
migração de pessoas para trabalhar nas obras, aliada à inundação causada pelos 
reservatórios, que pode agravar ainda mais a situação.

São Paulo ",Funcef e Petros cobiçam 10% da Camargo em Jirau,,,Rio Madeira dams: Jirau and Santo Antonio ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"

Cláudia Schuffner e Ivo Ribeiro 
Os fundos de pensão dos 
funcionários da Petrobras e da Caixa Econômica Federal (CEF) fazem uma nova 
ofensiva para participar dos projetos hidrelétricos do Rio Madeira, 
em Rondônia.  
Petros e Funcef, depois de uma tentativa frustrada de entrar no 
grupo controlador da usina Santo Antônio, agora estão avaliando a compra dos 
9,99% do grupo Camargo Corrêa na hidrelétrica de 
Jirau.
O grupo construtor e industrial 
paulista está presente no empreendimento por meio da Energia Sustentável do 
Brasil, que controla e vai operar a hidrelétrica.  O grupo franco-belga GDF Suez 
é o principal acionista, com 50,1% do capital.  Os demais 40% estão em divididos 
meio a meio pelas estatais Eletrosul e Chesf, subsidiárias da 
Eletrobrás.
Na época da formação do consórcio 
para disputar Jirau, foi firmado um acordo entre GDF Suez, Camargo e seus sócios 
estatais que previa uma permanência temporária do grupo na concessionária.  O 
grupo, que ficou responsável pela obra, entretanto tinha o direto de preferência 
de transferir a parcela à CPFL Energia, sua controlada.  A distribuidora de 
energia, por se tratar de participação minoritária e devido a seus padrões de 
retorno, não teve interesse no ativo.
A saída da construtora tem prazo 
definido: 180 dias desde 3 de junho, quando a usina obteve a licença de 
instalação.
O presidente da Funcef, Guilherme 
Lacerda, confirmou que está analisando o investimento junto com Petros, mas 
disse que ainda não tem definido quanto valeria o ativo.  O fundo contratou a 
LCA Consultoria para assessorá-lo na avaliação.  A obra de Jirau foi iniciada 
este ano e há intenção de ficar pronta início de 
2012.
Com investimento total de R$ 10 
bilhões a R$ 12 bilhões, o projeto obteve recentemente o maior financiamento a 
uma única obra da história do BNDES, no valor de R$ 7,2 bilhões - 60% a 72% do 
desembolso total.  A usina terá capacidade de 3.450 MW, com 46 turbinas, informa 
a empresa.
Segundo fontes do setor, o valor do 
negócio poderia ficar em 
torno de R$ 300 milhões.  Mas como a usina está em fase inicial 
de instalação, a grande parte do dinheiro seria na forma de aporte na obra da 
hidrelétrica.  A construtora receberia o correspondente ao seu gasto até a 
venda.
Segundo Lacerda, a avaliação da LCA 
levará em conta o fluxo de caixa futuro da Energia Sustentável, outros dados 
financeiros e padrão de governança.  ""Temos prazo"", diz.  Segundo ele, já faz um 
bom tempo que o fundo se interessou pelo ativo e quer resolver o negócio o mais 
breve possível.
O presidente da Petros, 
Wagner 
Pinheiro, disse ao Valor que provavelmente a parte da Camargo 
deve ser dividida os dois fundos.  Isso daria participação de 4,99% a cada um.  
Por fatia semelhante, segundo apurou o Valor, o fundo FI-FGTS pagou cerca de R$ 
150 milhões ao banco Santander, que se desfez de 50% de sua parte na Santo 
Antônio Energia, que constrói Santo Antônio.
Pinheiro, da Petros, frisou que o 
investimento ainda está em fase de análise.  Procurada, a Camargo Corrêa não 
quis se pronunciar sobre a operação de venda.
Os fundos são investidores 
estratégicos de longo prazo, com folga para aplicar em renda variável.  As 
primeiras tentativas de participarem das usinas do Madeira ocorreram antes do 
leilão de Santo Antonio, em dezembro de 2007.  Na ocasião, procuraram os três 
consórcios credenciados na disputa.  O plano era ter o correspondente a 10% cada 
um.  Depois, tentaram de novo, mas sem sucesso.  Jirau foi leiloada em maio de 
2008.  (Colaborou Josette Goulart, de São Paulo)

Beijing ",Chinese NGOs announce the second Green Banking Innovation Award,Bank of  ,China,,,,"
 
On behalf of nine Chinese environmental NGOs, Ms. Jin Jiaman, Director of Global Environmental Institute, announced the Green Banking Innovation Award on August 1st. China Industrial Bank Co. Ltd. received Green Banking Innovation Award for the second time at the Best China Banks Ceremony organized by the Economic Observer weekly.
This award was nominated and voted by nine renowned NGOs: Green Watershed, Friends of Nature, Institute of Public & Environmental Affairs, Green Earth Volunteer, Global Environmental Institute, Civil Society Watch, China Development Brief, Green Volunteer League of Chongqing and Hengduan Mountains Research Society. SynTao Co. Ltd., a leading consulting firm in China on corporate social responsibility, acted as an advisor to this award.
Integrating environmental standards and social responsible standards into core business strategies is a global trend for banks to develop sustainability. Responding to such trend, some banks in China established environmental policies and made remarkable achievement. For instance, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China dedicates itself to green credit policies; China Merchants Bank applies green credit policy to overseas investments. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and China Construction Bank invited a third party to audit their Social Responsibility Reports. In addition, on October 31, 2008, China Industrial Bank became the first bank in China to adopt the Equator Principles.
According to selection criteria made by the nine environmental NGOs, China Industrial Bank got the highest score and won the Green Banking Innovation Award. Since the adoption of the Equator Principles, China Industrial Bank has integrated sustainability issues into its strategy, and made progress, such as the establishment of the ""Environmental and Social Risk Management"" policy and the Center for Sustainable Finance. In addition, China Industrial Bank was a signatory of Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and participated in CDP survey.
On the ceremony, Ms. Jin Jiaman said, ""We expect China Industrial Bank can continue its innovation and build up a model green bank in China."" Representatives from China Industrial Bank called for more banks in China to contribute to sustainable finance.
Established in July 2008, the Green Banking Innovation Award is the first-ever award in China specifically about green banking, which promotes banks and other financial institutions to consider their roles in environmental protection. This not only indicates Chinese NGOs are using more diversified approaches to advocate sustainable development, but highlights the efforts of Chinese banking sector on environment. Mr. Yu Xiaogang, Director of Green Watershed, pointed out, ""Various interactions between environmental NGOs and financial institutions will be developed like dialoguing, monitoring, advocating, praising outstanding banks and criticizing problematic banks."" It was reported that the nine organizations will compile an Environmental Report on Chinese Banks based on this award evaluation, and publish it at the end of 2009.

中国 北京 ",民间环保团体评出第二届绿色银行创新奖,Bank of  ,China,,,,"
 
8月1日下午，在《经济观察报》举办的2008年度中国最佳银行评选颁奖仪式上，全球环境研究所负责人金嘉满代表绿色流域、自然之友、公众与环境研究中心、绿家园、全球环境研究所、守望家园、中国发展简报、重庆市绿色志愿者联合会、横断山研究会等九家民间环保团体宣布2008年度绿色银行创新奖评选结果。兴业银行再次脱颖而出，第二次获得 ""绿色银行创新奖""。商道纵横咨询公司作为企业社会责任专业咨询服务机构为此次评选提供了技术支持。
环境标准和社会责任标准进入银行决策的核心是全球银行业可持续发展的必然选择。在国际信贷和投资中，体现银行的社会和环境责任，降低银行的信贷风险，以增加国际竞争力。在这一环境背景下，我国金融界逐步建立了相应的环境政策，并取得了实质性的成果，如工商银行努力打造""绿色信贷""银行，最早实行""一票否决制""，建立信贷支持节能环保的长效机制。招商银行也提出了在2009年的信贷中提出环保为先的原则，首次制定了《绿色金融信贷政策》，并适用于海外投资。工商银行和建设银行等聘请第三方审验社会责任报告。兴业银行已于2008年10月31日承诺采纳赤道原则，成为中国第一家""赤道银行""。
此次""绿色银行创新奖""评选严格按照一定的技术路线和量化标准对参选的银行进行了信息采集、筛选和评判。主要评判指标包括：是否发布了企业社会责任报告以及第三方机构的独立鉴证；是否对投融资项目制定了环保政策；是否有专门的部门和人员负责社会与环境相关的事务；执行国家""绿色信贷""政策的情况；是否加入国际有关环保协议或与环保机构合作；公众、媒体在过去三年对其环境绩效表现的评价；是否对银行职员进行环境和社会责任的培训等13项指标。依据这些指标，九家民间环保团体从参选的九家银行：中国工商银行、中国银行、兴业银行、中国招商银行、中国建设银行、渣打银行、交通银行、北京银行、中信银行中评选出2008年度""绿色银行创新奖""的获奖银行--兴业银行。
兴业银行于2008年承诺采纳赤道原则，并将社会责任、环境责任和可持续金融引入银行发展战略、经营理念和营运模式；制订了《环境和社会风险管理政策》、严格的《信用业务准入标准》及信用审批制度；并设立兴业银行可持续金融中心，专人负责环境和社会风险的管理；2008年、2009年，兴业银行连续两年参与和支持碳信息披露项目（CDP），积极应对气候变化。
金嘉满主任在向兴业银行颁奖时，鼓励其""在创建绿色银行的过程中获得更大的成绩""，并表示""希望所有参选银行再接再厉，向绿色银行迈进""。兴业银行的代表则呼吁更多金融机构致力于节能减排、推动中国可持续金融的发展。
""绿色银行创新奖""是国内首个关于绿色银行的奖项，创设于2008年7月，对推动银行等金融机构参与环境保护具有开拓性的意义。该奖项的最大特色是完全由民间环保团体独立评选。国际绿色银行发展的经验表明，银行和金融机构环境责任制度的建立和完善，离不开社会参与和监督，特别是代表社会上的环境需求的民间环保组织的参与。由民间环保团体独立参与评选的""最佳绿色银行创新奖""，无疑是对银行参与环境保护新途径的探索，同时也是审视银行业更高社会价值和未来道路尝试，更是民间团体推动公众参与银行和金融机构在环境责任制度上的建立、完善的行动力体现。对此，民间社会能够也应当做出重要而积极的贡献。绿色流域负责人于晓刚指出，民间环保团体与金融机构的互动将会是形式多样的，包括对话、监督和倡导，既褒奖有杰出成绩的银行，也会批评问题严重的银行。据悉，九家民间环保团体将会在此次评选的基础上深入研究，编写中国银行业的环境报告，并计划在2009年底发布。

Toronto ","Unlikely appeal to RBC first lady, Mrs. Janet Nixon, highlights bank’s involvement in tar sands",Royal Bank of  (RBC) ,Canada,Canadian tar sands ,oil and gas,Canada,"
A
weeklong buzz around mysterious ""please help us Mrs. Nixon"" posters
in downtown Toronto culminated today at the Royal Bank of Canada's (RBC)
headquarters, where Rainforest Action Network (RAN) dropped a 15' x 30' banner
appealing to Janet Nixon, the wife of CEO Gordon Nixon. Protestors scaled the
50' flagpole at the main entrance to the RBC headquarters on Bay and
Wellington, replacing the flags with the 15' banner, which hung for 2.5 hours
as employees, including Gordon Nixon, arrived for work at the bank. The banner
and the posters asked for Mrs. Nixon's help to end the company's involvement
with destructive tar sands financing. RBC is the largest financier of the tar
sands expansion in Alberta, Canada's fastest growing source of water pollution
and global warming emissions. Two Indigenous Canadian women climbers were
ticketed by the Toronto Police for hanging the banner. 
Today's
banner and posters are linked to the launch of an Internet video featuring
Michael Brune, executive director of RAN. In the one-minute video, available
at pleasehelpusmrsnixon.com, Brune appeals to Mrs. Nixon, asking for her
help in pushing RBC to end investments in tar sands and to take a leadership
role in funding a clean energy future.  The video has been sent to more
than 70,000 people who have been asked to send the message to RBC's corporate
social responsibility department. 
Rainforest
Action Network is appealing to Mrs. Nixon, a committed environmentalist and the
first lady of RBC, to lend her strong and influential voice to those fighting
to protect Canada's clean water and ensure Canada meets its climate
commitments, which are threatened by the tar sands,"" said Michael Brune,
executive director of RAN. ""RBC has a critical role to play in investing
in Canada's clean energy future. The health of Canada's Indigenous peoples,
vital water resources and air quality need Mr. and Mrs. Nixon's help.""
   
Today's
protest highlights the stark contrast between RBC's status as the top financier
of the Alberta tar sands, and the company's PR promises to promote clean water.
Last year, RBC launched their Blue Water Project, an initiative ""committed
to donating $50 million toward global fresh water initiatives over the next ten
years."" In contrast to the $3 million dollars actually released in water
quality improvement donations under the program in the first year, RBC made
$2.2 billion in loans in 2007 alone to oil and gas companies operating in the
Alberta tar sands, one of Canada's largest sources of water pollution.  
""As
a member of the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation, the Tar Sands are destroying
our traditional ways of life and the future of our community,"" said Eriel
Deranger, an Indigenous Canadian and a RAN campaigner who is one of the
climbers in today's protest.  ""RBC touts its commitment to clean
water, but is a leading financier of Canada's most polluting industries. It's
time for RBC to be a true leader and stop bankrolling the tar
sands."" 
Extraction
of oil from the Alberta tar sands is a major threat to climate change, resulting
in three times more global warming-causing greenhouse gas emissions than
conventional oil. Tar sands development is turning once-pristine stretches of
forest into desolate, post-apocalyptic landscapes and producing toxic pollution
that is harmful to the health and quality of life of the region's First
Nations.

Nijmegen ",European banks withdraw from Ilisu dam project in Turkey,DekaBank ,Germany,Ilisu dam ,energy plants - dams,Turkey,"

BankTrack and its member organisations welcome yesterdays' decision of three leading European banks - Société Générale, UniCredit/Bank Austria and DekaBank - to withdraw from the highly contested Ilisu dam project in Turkey. With this unprecedented step the banks responded to the withdrawal of cover by the German, Austrian and Swiss export credit guarantees on July 7th.
In a joint press release issued on July 8, the banks stated that: ""In line with the decision of the Export Credit Agencies, the three banks will apply the mechanism foreseen in case the contractually agreed measures ensuring the World Bank guidelines on environment, resettlement and cultural heritage are not fully implemented. The export credit granted by Bank Austria, DekaBank and Société Générale for the construction of the Ilisu dam is therefore no longer available.""
Société Générale, UniCredit and DekaBank had signed loan contracts of approximately 450m Euro for the project, after Germany, Austria and Switzerland awarded export credit guarantees in March 2007. In recognition of huge deficits in the project planning, the Export Credit Agencies attached no less than 153 conditions to their cover. Ever since, the experts commissioned by the Swiss, German and Austrian governments to monitor the project, identified gross violations of these conditions by the Turkish authorities.
As a consequence, the three governments withdrew the guarantees and thus rendered the bank loans void. The three banks then had no choice but to follow suit.
In contrast to the banks, the consortium involved in the construction of the project including Andritz AG, Alstom and Strabag/Zueblin is still pondering whether to stay involved in the project. In a response it voiced its regret over the withdrawal of the export credit guarantees.
When completed, the Ilisu dam project would displace over 55,000 people of mostly Kurdish origin and destroy precious environmental habitat and invaluable cultural heritage, including the 15,000 year old town of Hasankeyf. The impact of the dam would be felt far downstream in Iraq, which in violation of international law was not consulted in the project planning and repeatedly protested the project. After years of planning and preparation, there still exists no solution for the resettlement of the affected population and the protection of the cultural heritage.
""The Ilisu project never met international standards. While the banks should never have gotten involved in the first place, we greatly welcome that they now draw the consequence from this and step out"", states Heike Drillisch from CounterCurrent, leading the Ilisu Campaign in Germany.
""Ilisu became the symbol of failed export politics. Its reputation now equals zero"", states Yann Louvel from Friends of the Earth France. ""So much of this trouble could have been avoided if the ECAs and banks involved had focused on assessing the projects' numerous failures rather than bow for political pressure ""
""The developments with Ilisu are almost without precedent, but it is an encouraging sign that leading banks are ready to retreat when faced with massive violations of conditions"", says Johan Frijns, coordinator of BankTrack. ""The proliferation of social and environmental policies adopted by banks in recent years slowly seems to raise the bar for obtaining project finance and export credits""
""The European non-governmental organisations which have campaigned against the Ilisu dam for years will continue to monitor the project. Any bank or company getting involved in Ilisu again will be faced with great protest and risk huge reputational damage"", says Ulrich Eichelmann from ECA Watch Austria.
""In order to avoid these blatant mistakes in the future, private banks should learn lessons from the Ilisu case and immediately include all recommendations of the World Commission on Dams in their credit policies"", says Antonio Tricarico of CRBM Italy.

Paris ",Victoire historique : la Société Générale se retire d’Ilisu !,Société Générale ,France,Ilisu dam ,energy plants - dams,Turkey,"
La Société Générale a annoncé officiellement son retrait du projet controversé de barrage d’Ilisu en Turquie. Les Amis de la Terre se félicitent de ce retrait demandé depuis 2007 : la Turquie violait systématiquement ses obligations dans le projet en laissant entiers les problèmes environnementaux, sociaux, culturels et politiques qu’il posait. La Société Générale doit désormais en tirer les conséquences et adopter dans les plus brefs délais des politiques sectorielles exigeantes si elle veut éviter ce genre de claque pour sa réputation à l’avenir.



C’est officiel ! La Société Générale vient d’annoncer le retrait de son soutien au financement export du projet de barrage d’Ilisu (1) . « C’est une victoire historique pour les ONG, dont les Amis de la Terre, et la campagne internationale « Stop Ilisu » qui s’opposent à ce projet depuis des années et n’ont eu de cesse de démontrer que la Turquie violait les obligations liées à ce projet et que les problèmes environnementaux, sociaux, culturels et géopolitiques restaient non résolus » déclare Yann Louvel, chargé de campagne Finance privée aux Amis de la Terre.
La décision de la Société Générale intervient dans la foulée de celle des gouvernements allemand, autrichien et suisse qui viennent de retirer leur garantie contre les risques à l’exportation pour ce projet. Ils ont définitivement reconnu, après six mois de tergiversations, que la Turquie ne respecterait pas les standards environnementaux et sociaux de la Banque Mondiale, particulièrement concernant le déplacement de plus de 55 000 personnes en majorité kurdes et la protection du patrimoine culturel de la ville de Hasankeyf. « La protection des personnes, des biens culturels et de l’environnement obtient la priorité face aux intérêts économiques à court terme : c’est une évolution importante », se réjouit Sébastien Godinot, coordinateur des campagnes aux Amis de la Terre.
Ces décisions devraient permettre d’empêcher, au moins à court terme, le financement du barrage controversé. En outre, cette décision empêchera la Turquie d’accéder à de l’argent public européen destiné à la construction d’autres barrages. « Ce retrait met en évidence la nécessité pour la Société Générale de se doter dans les plus brefs délais de politiques sectorielles de réduction des risques afin de ne plus être impliquée à l’avenir dans de tels projets. Le besoin est énorme puisqu’on retrouve par exemple la Société Générale dans 12 des 14 projets controversés mis en exergue sur le site Internet www.secretsbancaires.fr lancé le 25 juin dernier. La crédibilité de la banque, déjà ridiculisée dans l’affaire Kerviel et rattrapée par le scandale des subprimes, pâtit encore de son soutien à de nombreux projets et entreprises irresponsables » conclut Yann Louvel.

Berlin ",Ilisu Dam Project: European Governments Officially Announce Withdrawal,DekaBank ,Germany,Ilisu dam ,energy plants - dams,Turkey,"
The governments of Germany, Austria
and Switzerland
today officially
announced their withdrawal from the Ilisu project on the Tigris river
in Turkey.
Turkey's
efforts to build the controversial dam have thus failed for the second
time.
Environmental and human rights organisations have welcomed the decision
as a breakthrough
in their campaign to stop the project and to push for higher standards
for export
guarantees.
""The
withdrawal of the guarantees is a huge success for all groups who have
been
tirelessly campaigning against the project in the involved countries"",
says Heike
Drillisch of the German Ilisu Campaign CounterCurrent. For more than
ten years
non-governmental organisations continously provided conclusive evidence
that
the Ilisu project fails to meet international standards, eventually
leading up
to today's backing out by the European governments. ""Ilisu has become a
symbol
of failed export politics. With Ilisu, governments, banks and companies
have
learned their lesson the hard way. After insisting for years that the
project
would fulfil World Bank standards, they have finally accepted that the
project
cannot be brought in line with international standards and has huge
negative impacts
on the cultural heritage, ecosystems and people in the region. After
Ilisu,
governments will hopefully stay away from even considering the funding
of
similar projects in the future.""
The loss of
public guarantees renders the loans void which had been provided by
European
banks. The Turkish government now lacks both an essential part of the
financing
as well as the European technology needed for the construction of the
dam. In the
wake of the financial crisis, both losses will be hard to compensate. Turkey's
economic output recently dropped a record 13.8 %. In addition, the
non-governmental organisations already announced their intent to
continue to
monitor the project, so that potential lenders will face great
resistance.
For the
campaigns in Turkey
that demand the stop of the project, the withdrawal of the Europeans
means new
hope. ""Our efforts to save the cultural heritage and the means of
existence of
the people in the Tigris valley will
continue
in an even larger alliance"", said Ercan Ayboga from the Initiative To
Keep Hasankeyf
Alive. ""The government has lost all legitimacy to carry the project
out. For
the first time, we have the chance to actually stop the project.""
Since 1998,
the Turkish government has tried to implement the project with
international participation.
After a first attempt failed in 2002 due to unresolved environmental
and social
problems, the governments of Germany,
Austria and Switzerland
granted export credit guarantees in March 2007. As the project did not
meet
international standards, they attached approx. 150 conditions on
resettlement,
environment, cultural heritage and transboundary issues to the
guarantees.
Non-governmental organisations criticized the conditions as not
sufficient.
They specifically pointed out that all conditions including a full
environmental
impact assessment, realistic plans for the resettlement and the
protection of
the cultural heritage, the participation of the affected population and
an
agreement with the neighbouring countries need to be fulfilled before a
decision on the guarantees is taken. However, as not even these
conditions were
fulfilled by the Turkish authorities, the guarantees were now
terminated retroactively.

Vienna, Austria ",Austria's ECA officially declares pull-out of Ilisu dam project,DekaBank ,Germany,Ilisu dam ,energy plants - dams,Turkey,"
Finally it is official: Rudolf Scholten, the head of the Austrian export
credit agency Oesterreichische Kontrollbank (OeKB), declared this evening that
the OeKB will disengage from the Ilisu dam project in eastern Turkey. Never
before has a contract with an export credit agency been cancelled for social,
cultural or ecological reasons. ""This is one of the biggest successes by
NGOs in Europe in recent years, and marks an
important victory on the path to the final end of the Ilisu project"", said
Ulrich Eichelmann of the Stop Ilisu Campaign. ""This decision turns ,Ilisu'
into an internationally known symbol for wrong and reckless economic
policy"", continued Mr. Eichelmann.
Turkey's declaration
that they will build the dam by themselves and begin construction shortly seems
unrealistic. The loss of European funding will cause a significant delay in the
construction schedule at the very least. The project's negative international
reputation as well as ongoing opposition will discourage new companies and
investors. In the meantime the already enormous public opposition in Turkey
will increase.
Austria, Germany and Switzerland's
pull-out is the result of years of struggle and intense campaining, in Europe
as well as in Turkey.
In March 2007 the three countries signed a contract with Turkey,
strongly committing themselves to carrying out the project together with construction
firms and banks. No other dam project has stirred so much excitement and
attention in recent years. Hundreds of protest actions, press activities and
events lead to this turn-around. ""The chances that the Ilisu project will
effectively be impeded have never been as high as today. We will continue our
work and do our utmost to stop the project and have the region declared UNESCO
world heritage instead"", says Thomas Wenidoppler of ECA Watch Austria.
What are the implications of the European retreat?Germany, Austria and Switzerland will not issue
guarantees with tax money for the Ilisu project. As a consequence the European
banks involved (UniCredit/Bank Austria, Deka Bank and Sociéte Général) will not
submit their loans amounting to at least 450 million Euro. Without the official
export guarantees it is most likely that the European construction firms will
pull out of the project as well. Turkey will be lacking money and know-how.
According to the project schedule the German-Austrian company Züblin was
supposed to begin with a deviation tunnel for the Tigris
river, in order to build the dam in a dry river bed. This has become impossible
now. Even more important is the project's bad reputation. Every company and
financer who wants to engage in this project will be confronted with international
resistance and ostracism.

Brussels ",Belgium bans investments in depleted uranium weapons,,,,,,"
Yesterday
the Belgian Parliament unanimously approved a law forbidding investments in
depleted uranium weapons. Belgium is now the first country to prevent the flow
of money to producers of uranium weapons. This law complements the country's
ban on their manufacture, testing, use, sale and stockpiling which came into
force on June 21st last. The use of depleted uranium armour piercing munitions
during combat causes the release of chemically toxic and radioactive particles
which represent a long term hazard for the environment as well as for human
health.
No
Belgian money for depleted uranium weaponsSenator
Philippe Mahoux submitted the law proposal in the Belgian Senate, where it was
unanimously approved on the 2nd of April 2009. Approval in the Chamber of
Representatives followed on the 2nd of July. The law forbids banks and
investment funds operating on the Belgian market from offering credit to
producers of armour and munitions that contain depleted uranium. The purchase
of shares and bonds issued by these companies is also prohibited. This law
implies that financial institutions in Belgium must bring their investments in
large weapon producers such as Alliant Techsystems (US), BAE Systems (UK) and
General Dynamics (US) to an end. Only investments made via index funds, and the
financing of projects of these companies that are clearly unrelated to uranium
munitions will be allowed. The law also obliges the government to draw up a
""black list"" of uranium weapon producers.
Pioneers
- and those left behindFor
years, Netwerk Vlaanderen has been running a campaign that opposes investment
in controversial weapons, such as depleted uranium weapons. Some banks, such as
Triodos Bank and KBC, have taken their responsibility seriously and have
decided to end their investment in depleted uranium weapons completely. Banks
such as ING have partially excluded producers of uranium weapons. Other bank
groups, such as Deutsche Bank still allow investments in these controversial
weapons. The passing of this law ensures that the money of Belgian bank
clients, no matter where they bank, is prevented from ending up in the hands of
uranium weapons manufacturers.
The need
for an international approachBelgium
is taking initiative at an international level by pushing this new law through.
Worldwide awareness on long term harm causing effects of these weapons is
growing. The resolution taken by the European Parliament in 2008 for example
was supported by 94 percent of the EU members and calls for an immediate
moratorium on the use of uranium weapons. A next step should be to halt
investments in these kind of weapons. The report of  2007 ‘Too risky for
business', published by Netwerk Vlaanderen in cooperation with the
International Coalition to Ban Uranium Weapons, already made clear that there
is a strong need for an international investment ban. It reported the
investments of 47 international financial institutions in 3 major uranium
weapons manufacturers.

undergoing a permanent structural shift.The authors assert that
previous oil demand growth forecasts have seriously underestimated the
potential impacts of government policies aimed at securing energy
supplies, reducing price volatility and tackling climate change. This
‘triple crunch’ of political imperatives has led to a widespread
dampening of expectation among the world’s leading energy analysts.Shifting Sands is the second update to the Rising Risks report. "

London ",UK Government faces environmental legal challenge over RBS,Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS)  ,United Kingdom,,,,"
The World Development Movement, PLATFORM and People & Planet have
today launched legal action against the Treasury for allowing public money,
poured into the Royal Bank of Scotland
to be invested in energy companies, and projects linked to climate change and
human rights violations.
Since RBS was bailed out in October 2008, it has contributed to loans
worth an estimated £10 billion in coal, oil and gas companies. Coal is the
biggest source of carbon emissions globally, which contributes to dangerous
climate change. The campaigners believe that by investing in RBS, the Treasury
is in direct conflict with the government's legislation and policies to reduce
carbon emissions and prevent dangerous climate change.
 Julian Oram, from the World Development Movement said:""The government
has spent billions on a bank with a track record of financing energy companies'
dirty and destructive projects. We're launching this action because the
Treasury has displayed a blatant disregard to the government's own commitments
to tackling climate change, and its rules for spending public money. The
taxpayers' interests would be vastly better served by RBS investing in a low
carbon future than in undemocratic regimes and environmentally devastating
projects around the world.""
Kevin Smith, from PLATFORM said:""The government
can't pretend to be a global leader on dealing with climate change while at the
same time refusing to rein in a public body that is financing new coal, oil and
gas projects all over the world.""
Ian Leggett, from People & Planet said:""The government
now controls RBS and has an exceptional opportunity to drive investments in low
carbon jobs and infrastructure - not to repeat the recklessness of the past. If
we are to stand a chance of stopping catastrophic climate change, the first
priority is to make a clear and irreversible commitment to stop investing in
high carbon companies and projects, but to prioritise investments in renewable
energies.""
Rosa Curling, solicitor from Leigh Day said:""The government has
the power and control to ensure public money provided to UK banks is not
invested in or lent to projects that harm the climate or individual human
rights. The refusal by the Treasury to even consider whether an investment
could contribute to climate change or result in human rights abuses is clearly
unlawful and completely out of line with the government's own guidance,
policies and targets on these issues.""
Since its bail out, RBS has taken part in an estimated £10 billion in
loans to coal, oil and gas companies including:
- £6 billion to
controversial energy giant E.ON, which is aiming to build the first new coal
power station in the UK
for over 20 years.
- In January 2009, RBS
helped raise £400 million for the Irish company Tullow Oil, and in March 2009
RBS was part of a consortium of 14 banks that lent £1.4 billion to Tullow Oil. Tullow
Oil is involved in the exploration and extraction of oil on the border between Uganda and the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This area has seen some of the fiercest
fighting in an extractive resource-driven civil war as rival armies and
militias have struggled for control of the land, leading to thousands of
civilian deaths and refugees.
- RBS has helped to
raise £116 million for Cairn Energy, a Scottish oil company, to be used for
'accelerated drilling' in arctic Greenland.
- RBS has previously promoted itself as ‘the oil and gas bank', financing
fossil fuel projects and companies around the world. Between May 2006 and April
2008, RBS took part in loans to the coal industry worth nearly $100 billion.
- The campaigners believe that the evidence submitted to the High Court
today provides convincing grounds to order the government to ensure that
taxpayers' money in RBS supports investments in the wider public interest, by
promoting a low carbon, sustainable and ethical future.
 
Notes to editors:
- RBS was first
recapitalised by the UK
government in October 2008, the government's voting stake is currently capped
at 75 per cent.
- On March 2, 2008, the
Treasury established the framework for the management of public investment in
recapitalised banks via UK Financial Investments. The framework sets out the
basis for how the board of UKFI should manage government shares in the banks,
but makes no reference to the need to consider social and environmental
criteria, nor indeed supporting or even being consistent with other public
policy objectives.
- The Green Book:
Appraisal and Evaluation in Central Government requires central government to
undertake a comprehensive and proportionate assessment of all new policies,
programme and projects so as to best promote the public interest when using
government resources (GB:1, para 1.1). One of the stages of this appraisal is
the ‘option appraisal: that is, an appraisal of a range of different options
against key variables such as costs, benefits and distributional, unvalued and
non-market impacts .
- In a letter dated 21
April 2009 from the Treasury to legal council instructed by PLATFORM, the
Treasury states that ""The environmental and human rights records of the
individual banks were of no relevance to the decision and therefore the
appraisal of the decision that was carried out did not consider the
environmental or human rights records or policies of the individual banks.""
- In a report published
on 16 March 2009, Pre-Budget Report 2008: Green fiscal policy in a recession,
the Environmental Audit Committee made the following recommendation to the
Treasury on green finance. ""The Committee also calls on the Treasury to look at
the benefits and practicalities of imposing some form of environmental criteria
on the investment strategies of those banks in which the state had a
controlling stake.""

Brussels ",BankTrack members unveil bank secrets,Banco Santander ,Spain,,,,"
Campagna per la Riforma della Banca Mundiale (Italy), Friends of the Earth (France), Netwerk Vlaanderen (Belgium), Platform (UK), SETEM (Spain) and Urgewald (Germany) expose investments in harmful practices and companies of thirteen large European banks in this new website.  Despite of the banking crisis, financial institutions continue to do harmful investments in a sphere of secrecy. To expose banks´ secrets, activists ‘undressed the banks' by staging parallel theatrical activities in the main European capitals. 
Recent research done by these members of the BankTrack network uncovers the links between banks and blacklisted companies supporting dictators, causing irreversible environmental damage or producing indiscriminate weaponry, such as cluster munitions, The thirteen researched banks together invest 39.6 billion euros in 14 such companies and projects.
From  2005 to 2009, Banco Santander, Barclays, BBVA, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Credit Agricole, Deutsche Bank, ING, Intesa Sanpaolo, HSBC, RBS, Société générale and Unicredit, invested massively in 14 blacklisted companies such as the cluster munition producer Textron, the Chinese oil company Petrochina and the Indian mining company Vedanta Resources.
The thirteen banks have financed 11,4 billion euros in loans to the 14 blacklisted companies as well as arranged and underwritten bond and share issues for a total value of 10,5 billion euros. In addition, the thirteen banks own or manage 17,7 billion euros of shares in the researched companies.
""These kind of harmful investments can no longer be tolerated. We think that financial institutions should take important environmental and human rights norms into consideration in their investment decisions. We ask for an ethical bottom line: no money for dictators, serious environmental destruction, controversial arms or violations of human rights.""
""Investors should not wait until they are found legally responsible for the violations of human rights and serious environmental damage. They should make sure they don't generate profit from such controversial practices. Financial institutions have a huge leverage power and can contribute to positive change"", said Mathias Bienstman from Netwerk Vlaanderen.
The website offers a world map illustrating the harmful investments of European banks, bank profiles and information on the financial links between the companies and the banks.  The site also offers the possibility to send an e-card to the bank CEO and learn more about Ethical Banking as a sustainable option.

Berlin, Vienna, Zurich ","Germany, Austria and Switzerland backing out of Ilisu Dam Project in Turkey",DekaBank ,Germany,Ilisu dam ,energy plants - dams,Turkey,"
Germany, Austria and Switzerland will
withdraw their export credit guarantees for the highly controversial
Ilisu dam project in Turkey by July 6th, as the German daily
Frankfurter Rundschau Online reported on Friday. This is an
unprecedented step in the history of export finance. Environmental and
human rights organisations had repeatedly pointed out that Turkey
violated conditions tied to the guarantees and the environmental,
social, cultural and geopolitical problems remained unsolved.   ""We
greatly welcome that the European governments finally take
international standards for this project seriously"", comments Heike
Drillisch from the German Ilisu Campaign CounterCurrent. ""This is a
great step forward for the protection of human rights, the environment
and cultural heritage.""
CounterCurrent and the Swiss organisation Berne Declaration had only
recently been to the Ilisu region on the Tigris river to analyse if
Turkey was fulfilling the European conditions. „Our research showed
that there is still no solution for the 60,000 people losing their
means of existence nor for the salvage of the invaluable cultural
heritage doomed by flooding"", declares Berne Declaration's Christine
Eberlein. ""On the contrary, Turkey has continued to expropriate farmers
even during the ultimatum.""
Due to repeated violations of the conditions by the Turkish
authorities, the governments of Germany, Austria and Switzerland had
put the contracts on hold for 180 days at the end of 2008. The deadline
to decide on the final withdrawal ends on July 6th, but the German
government obviously already made up its mind. As the three countries
decide unanimously, this means that Austria and Switzerland will also
back out.
The withdrawal is a huge victory for environmentalists and human
rights advocates who have campaigned for years for the stop of the mega
dam. It increases the likelihood that project will be cancelled
completely, as Turkey now lacks 450 m Euro and technical know how. The
political impacts of the withdrawal weigh even stronger: for the first
time export credit contracts are cancelled on grounds of humanitarian,
cultural and environmental concerns. The reputation of the project thus
equals to zero. Therefore it will be difficult for Turkey to find new
sponsors, as the European banks providing finance for the project are
expected to also withdraw.
""This is an important stage win for us. We will now increase our
efforts to have the project revoked in Turkey as well"", says Ulrich
Eichelmann from the Stop Ilisu Campaign in Austria. Prominent artists
like nobel prize writer Orhan Pamuk and pop singer Tarkan have already
embarked the campaign to stop the Ilisu dam and make the antique town
of Hasankeyf and the surrounding Tigris river a UNESCO World Heritage
Site. "

São Paulo ",Santander é alvo de campanha internacional contra impactos ao meio ambiente,,,Rio Madeira dams: Jirau and Santo Antonio ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"

Nesta sexta-feira (19), a 
organização da sociedade civil espanhola Setem fez uma intervenção na assembléia 
de acionistas do Banco Santander para pedir que o banco cumpra compromissos 
socioambientais feitos em 2008.
O manifesto acontece após um ano de 
realizada a ação “Não com o meu dinheiro”, quando a entidade conversou com o 
presidente do Santander, Emílio Botín, e os acionistas do banco para 
pressioná-los a não investir no Complexo de usinas do rio Madeira (RO).  Na 
ocasião, o presidente se comprometeu a apoiar a causa ou pelo menos a 
estudá-la.  ""Senhores ecologistas, suas palavras são acolhidas com muito 
interesse, nossa equipe no Brasil se reunirá em breve com os senhores, eu me 
responsabilizarei pessoalmente disso"", enfatizou ao responder às perguntas dos 
ambientalistas.
Após um ano, o banco continua sendo 
um dos financiadores do complexo e a Setem volta a fazer o lobby durante a 
assembléia de acionistas.  “Nessa intervenção, quero mostrar novamente a vocês 
(acionistas) que o financiamento por parte do Banco Santander do Complexo 
Hidrelétrico do Rio Madeira, situado no Brasil, não é compatível com a política 
que se quer desenvolver nem com os Princípios do Equador, cujo banco é 
signatário.  Recordo ainda que o ‘Complexo Hidrelétrico do Rio Madeira’ consiste 
na construção de quatro usinas no rio citado, o afluente mais caudaloso do  
Amazonas.  A execução da primeira represa, Santo Antonio, já está tendo graves 
consequências para a população local e o entorno natual”, afirmou 
Annie Yumi 
Joh, responsável pela área de Finanças Éticas da Setem, em 
carta apresentada aos acionistas.
Em resposta, o presidente o 
Santander afirmou que a instituição está preocupada com a questão ambiental.  
“Com relação à operação do Rio Madeira, no Brasil, posso dizer que o nosso plano 
de ação se desenvolveu para a gestão do meio ambiente.  Já foram feitas as 
revisões implantadas dentro do plano anual de sustentabilidade e estamos nos 
ocupando deste tema concretamente”, afirmo ele.
Segundo Yumi Joh, o ideal seria que 
o banco retirasse o investimento, mas se não for possível, “esperamos que o 
Santander tenha consciência do impacto desta atividade e pediremos que cumpra 
sua própria política de responsabilidade social”, 
disse.
Para ela, o banco deu passos 
positivos durante 2008 ao adotar, por exemplo, uma nova política social e 
ambiental em todo o mundo e ao assinar os Princípios do Equador, algo 
“incompatível com o projeto do rio Madeira”, disse.
Roland 
Widmer, coordenador do Eco Finanças, da 
organização Amigos da Terra – Amazônia Brasileira, que também pressiona os 
bancos a não investirem em projetos com excessivos impactos socioambientais 
negativos, como é o caso do complexo, acredita que o Banco não realizou o acordo 
prometido em 2008.  “Consideramos que Santander não cumpriu a promessa feita na 
última reunião.  Especificamente, Botin disse em 2008 que sua equipe no Brasil 
se reuniria em breve com organizações brasileiras, porém, não teve engajamento 
com a população afetada ou com a sociedade civil organizada.  Vamos continuar 
exigindo e cobrando o respeito dos aspectos socioambientais do projeto”, 
declara.
Campanha A participação da Setem na 
Assembléia do Santander faz parte da estratégia da entidade de “ativismo 
acionário” e da campanha “Exija responsabilidade do BBVA e Santander"", lançada 
em março de 2008 pela organização, que denuncia o Banco Bilbao Vizcaya 
Argentaria (BBVA) e o Santander por investirem em projetos que impactam 
negativamente a região amazônica.
Rio Madeira O plano 
do complexo prevê a construção das hidrelétricas de Santo Antônio, Jirau, 
Guajará e Cachoeira Esperança; a construção de eclusas, hidrovias e de uma 
grande linha de transmissão de energia que vai de Porto Velho até São 
Paulo.

Berlin, Vienna, Zurich ",Ilisu dam-affected people expropriated amidst ultimatum,Société Générale ,France,Ilisu dam ,energy plants - dams,Turkey,"
 
The Stop Ilisu Campaign learned today that the
Government of Turkey continues to expropriate people near the Ilisu Dam Site on
the Tigris River. This is a clear breach of the
export conditions from Austria,
Germany and Switzerland. On
May 6, courts in Turkey
have withdrawn the land rights of 30 families near Hasankeyf, and have paid
them a meagre compensation in return. This proves yet again that the Government
of Turkey is not in a position, or not inclined, to fulfil international
standards for dam building.
„The
constant disregard for the conditions from the European governments as well as
the ignorance of the Turkish authorities vis-à-vis the European partners has to
have consequences. The Europeans need to permanently withdraw from the
project"", says Ulrich Eichelmann, a spokesperson of the Stop Ilisu Campaign.
Ludwig
Fliesser, a student of the University
of Vienna, has uncovered the scandal
concerning the unlawful expropriations while working on his diploma near the
Ilisu Dam Site in Turkey.
He did research in Ankara and in the hamlets
near the dam site on the shores of the Tigris River.
While in Turkey,
the inhabitants of Kesmeköprü III, a small village opposite of Hasankeyf,
showed him the court orders ordering the expropriation of 30 families. The
court order was dated May 6, which is during the time when the Ilisu Dam
contracts between Turkey
and the European countries were suspended.
The
Turkish authorities wanted to purchase land for ""New-Hasankeyf"" opposite of the
antique town doomed to be flooded by the Ilisu reservoir. However, instead of
compensating the affected people with a sum representing the replacement value
of their land, and according to international standards, the authorities tried
to compensate the people with a ridiculous amount. The farmers felt cheated and
refused the compensation deal. The Government of Turkey, in response, went to
the district courts in Batman in January 2009, to make the expropriation
effective, notwithstanding the refusal of the affected people. In June, the
affected people learned from the district court that the meagre compensation
amount had been further cut by 40% and the land transferred to the government.
The affected people are now faced with ruin.
„The
decision of the court in Batman is a scandal. The water authority of Turkey once
again plays with the Europeans and blatantly ignores the suspension of the
contracts"", says Christine Eberlein of the Swiss NGO Berne Declaration.
The
Turkish water authorities had already expropriated villages near the Ilisu Dam
Site in 2007, paying them a meagre compensation amount. After pressure from the
Stop Ilisu Campaign, the three European governments had stopped the process and
Turkey
had vowed to improve on the management of compensation. ""With the latest
expropriations, the Turkish government demonstrates that it has no interest in
cooperating with Europe. It is high time to
withdraw from this disastrous project"", states Heike Drillisch, the coordinator
of the German Ilisu Campaign.
Experts
and representatives of the Export Credit Agencies are near the Ilisu Dam Site
this week to verify whether Turkey
has fulfilled the conditions. Germany,
Austria and Switzerland are
likely to decide afterwards whether to remain in the project or to withdraw
from it. This will impact the loans for the Ilisu project provided Société Générale,
UniCredit/Bank Austria, and the German DekaBank who have been under heavy
criticism from civil society organisations for their engagement in the project.

Berlin ",Nomination Deutsche Bank makes mockery of Sustainable Banking Awards,Allianz ,Germany,,,,"
Today, the Financial Times and IFC, a member of the
World Bank group, will announce the winners of the 2009 FT Sustainable Banking
Awards. This year, Deutsche Bank is on the five bank shortlist for the category
„Sustainable Bank of the Year"".
„Already the application of Deutsche Bank for this
award is a scandal. The awards were created to recognise banks that have shown
leadership and innovation in integrating social and environmental
considerations into their operations. 
Deutsche Bank is not playing a leading role in this field. It´s poor
environmental guidelines as well as its distinctly underwhelming track record
have already proved that Deutsche Bank is a late-comer and not a pioneer in
this context"", says Barbara Happe from the German NGO Urgewald.
In public, Deutsche Bank presents itself as a pioneer
in sustainability issues. Studies which compare the performance of large banks
deliver a damning indictment of Deutsche bank´s performance. For example „Mind
the Gap"", a report of the international NGO network BankTrack has analysed the
sustainability efforts of 45 large banks worldwide. Deutsche Bank scores
amongst are lowest in 16 of the 18 categories of policies examined.
The absence of a robust set of social and
environmental policies to guide investment decisions in high impact sectors
also reflects in its financial practices. „Deutsche Bank doesn´t stop investing
in companies notoriously damaging the environment and abusing human rights. The
bank is financing companies like Vedanta and Freeport which are well-known for polluting
water systems and systematically breaching the laws of host countries..
Therefore, other financial institutions have already blacklisted these
companies "", explains Esther Vandenbroucke from the Belgian NGO Netwerk
Vlaanderen who published a study „Banksecrets"" on harmful investments last
year.
Deutsche Banks „green"" image is also increasingly
being questioned in Germany.
The inhabitants of Mainz and Wiesbaden are increasingly opposing the
construction of a new coal power plant in their region, a plant that Deutsche
Banks stands ready to finance. „With the eco-renovation of its Frankfurt
Headquarters Deutsche Bank presents itself as a environmentally advanced. But
the emissions of the planned coal power plant will surpass the reduction
achieved with this renovation 750 times. Credible climate policies looks
different and do not stop at the entrance of the company headquarters"" comments
Elias Perabo of Klima-Allianz.
Due to the weak environmental and social record of
Deutsche Bank, the environmental and human rights organisations inform the jury
members of the award: „If this award wants to be a true performance benchmark
on exemplary behavior, Deutsche Bank should not receive the award. If it does,
this would mean a disaster for the credibility of the award"". "

Zur Hauptversammlung am 26. Mai erhält die Deutsche Bank weit gereisten Besuch: Almoustapha Alhacen, stellvertretender Bürgermeister der nigrischen
Stadt Arlit und langjähriger Areva-Mitarbeiter nutzt die Gelegenheit,
um Deutsche Bank-Vorstandschef Ackermann persönlich mit den negativen
Konsequenzen des Uranabbaus in seiner Heimat zu konfrontieren. Er
fordert bessere Sicherheitsstandards für die radioaktiven Abfälle und
eine unabhängige Untersuchung der Umweltauswirkungen des Uranabbaus.
Dabei richtet er sich direkt an die Deutsche Bank, denn: „Die Deutsche
Bank unterstützt kontinuierlich die Pläne des Atomkonzerns Areva, den
Uranbergbau in Afrika voranzutreiben und verdient daran gut. Deshalb
muss sie auch die Verantwortung für die hohen gesundheitlichen und
ökologischen Kosten mit übernehmen“, so Alhacen.  Der Umweltaktivist und Filmemacher Samarendra Das kommt aus dem
indischen Orissa, um die Geschäfte der Deutschen Bank mit dem
Bergbau-Unternehmen Vedanta zu kritisieren. „Andere Finanzdienstleister
wie der Staatliche Norwegische Pensionsfonds haben Vedanta längst aus
ihrem Portfolio gestrichen wegen systematischer Verletzungen von
Umwelt- und Menschenrechten bei unterschiedlichen Unternehmungen -
sowohl hier in Indien als auch anderswo. Es ist unbegreiflich, warum
die Deutsche Bank weiterhin an diesem Skandalkunden festhält“, erklärt
Das. In Orissa plant die Vedanta-Tochter Sterlite Industries derzeit -
trotz massiver Proteste und Blockaden - die Errichtung einer
Bauxitmine, für die indigene Heiligtümer der Dongria Kondh zerstört
werden müssten.  „Die Liste skandalöser Finanzierungen der Deutschen Bank ist lang“,
urteilt Dr. Barbara Happe von der Umwelt- und
Menschenrechtsorganisation urgewald. „Beispiele wie Areva und Vedanta
zeigen, dass das Risikomanagement bei der Deutschen Bank in Sachen
Umwelt- und Menschenrechtsschutz mangelhaft ist.“  Die Deutschen Bank selbst versucht, sich in der Öffentlichkeit als
Vorreiterin in Sachen Nachhaltigkeit zu präsentieren. Keine andere
deutsche Bank hat mehr Selbstverpflichtungen zum Thema Nachhaltigkeit
unterzeichnet als sie - es sind mittlerweile etwa 20. Urgewald
kritisiert jedoch, dass sie bisher darauf verzichtet, diese
Selbstverpflichtungen mit Leben zu füllen und verbindliche Umwelt- und
Sozialstandards für ihr Finanzierungsgeschäft zu verabschieden und zu
veröffentlichen. Damit hinkt sie anderen internationalen Großbanken
hinterher. die bereits vor Jahren Standards entwickelt haben, um sich
wirkungsvoller vor ökologischen und sozialen Fehlinvestitionen zu
schützen.  „Wer sich die Nachhaltigkeitspolitik der Deutschen Bank anschaut,
gelangt unweigerlich zu dem Schluss, dass es dabei primär um
Imagepolitur geht. Mit Hochglanzbroschüren und einzelnen grünen
Vorzeigeprojekten wie jetzt die ökologische Modernisierung der
Zwillingstürme will die Deutsche Bank von fehlenden Umwelt- und
Menschenrechtsstandards sowie Skandalfinanzierungen ablenken“, urteilt
Dr. Happe. „Bei diesem Thema ist die Deutsche Bank noch Lichtjahre
davon entfernt, um den Banken-Weltmeistertitel mitspielen zu können,
den Herr Ackermann so gern erringen will“.
 Hintergrund Das urgewald-Dossier “Deutsche Bank: ein fragwürdiges Markenzeichen"" stellt acht besonders umstrittene Finanzdienstleistungen der Deutschen
Bank aus den letzten Jahren vor. Der deutsche Bankenprimus gibt Kredite
an Firmen, die Bürgerkriege anheizen wie das Goldunternehmen AngloGold
Ashanti in der DR Kongo oder das Ölkonglomerat CNPC/PetroChina im Sudan
und stellt sich als Hausbank für die korrupte Regierung Turkmenistans
zur Verfügung. Sie ist Partner für Umweltsünder und Wasservergifter in

Washington DC ","Leading banks facilitating corruption, fuelling poverty",Barclays ,United Kingdom,,,,"
Some of
the world's major banks, including Barclays and Citibank, have been
facilitating corruption and undermining development in some of the
worst-governed countries in the world, campaigning organisation Global Witness
will testify to the U.S. House of Representatives' Financial Services Committee
today (May 19).
Global
Witness lead investigator, Anthea Lawson, will tell Committee members,
including Chairman Barney Frank, that a catalogue of failures in the design and
enforcement of anti-money laundering laws has enabled banks to help politicians
from some of the world's most corrupt regimes to use government money to fund
lavish lifestyles, while their populations live in poverty.
""The
key factors allowing banks to do business with corrupt regimes are precisely
those which allowed banks to destabilize the U.S. and other major economies 
People now agree that we need to reassess the way we regulate banks. We must
also take this opportunity to tackle the way banks facilitate corruption, and
thus help fuel poverty,"" said Ms Lawson.   
Global
Witness will tell the Committee how during the conflict in Sierra Leone and
Liberia, Citibank facilitated banking activities that allowed Charles Taylor
corruptly to divert timber revenues for his own personal use, and to fund the
conflict. Many innocent people were killed in the war and Taylor is now on
trial for war crimes.
Global
Witness will also show how Barclays continued to hold an account for the son of
the president of Equatorial Guinea long after a U.S. bank, Riggs, was hit with
civil and criminal penalties following an investigation into its banking for
Equatorial Guinea's corrupt regime.
Liberia
and Equatorial Guinea are just two examples of countries where natural resource
wealth has been captured by a small minority for their own benefit, with the
help of international banks. The human costs are high - not only are the
citizens of these countries denied the potential benefits of well-managed
resources but the corruption often fuels conflict, suffering and ultimately
failed states 
Banks
are required by anti-money laundering laws in most countries to identify their
customers and their source of funds, in order to avoid taking the proceeds of
corruption. Yet in each of the cases Global Witness has examined, banks have
done business with customers about whom there is significant evidence of
corruption in the public domain. Banks' willingness to do business with these
corrupt regimes is helping to deny poor countries the crucial resources needed
for development and poverty alleviation.
Ms
Lawson will say: ""The U.S. government has an opportunity to help lift millions
of people out of poverty in the developing world, in a way that aid flows will
never achieve  If this opportunity is not taken, the global financial system
will be left open not just to the proceeds of corruption but to the opaque
financial flows that have contributed to the immediate crisis, as well as to
terrorist and proliferation finance.""
Global
Witness is calling on the U.S. government to:
* Amend
its regulations to explicitly require banks not only to identify the beneficial
owner of the funds, but to have strong evidence that they are not the proceeds
of corruption before accepting them, and to ensure that this requirement is
enforced.
* To use its influence in the Financial Action Task Force, the
inter-governmental body that sets the standards for anti-money laundering laws,
to focus global attention on the proceeds of corruption as well as on terrorist
finance; ensure that the U.S.'s standards are not undermined by weaker
standards elsewhere; and amend the standards to require open registries of
beneficial ownership and control of companies and trusts in every country.

Washington, D.C. ",Spain’s Banco Santander Criticized for Hypocrisy,Banco Santander ,Spain,Rio Madeira dams: Jirau and Santo Antonio ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"
Spain’s Banco Santander, which has been facing growing criticism for being a lead financier in a highly controversial dam project in the Brazilian Amazon, recently signed on to the “Equator Principles,” a set of socially and environmentally responsible financing guidelines adopted by a growing number of private banks.  At an annual meeting of the Equator banks this week in Washington, D.C., environmental organizations are challenging Banco Santander to demonstrate its commitment to the Equator Principles by pulling out of all aspects of the controversial Madeira Dam Complex.
The Santo Antônio and Jirau hydroelectric dams being built on Brazil’s Madeira River, the principal tributary to the Amazon River, have generated enormous controversy in Brazil due to the drastic environmental and social threats the projects pose to the region’s complex and fragile ecosystems as well as to the indigenous and traditional communities that rely on the waterway for their survival. In addition to adverse social and environmental impacts, the financing of the dams is also risky from a financial viewpoint, as several legal actions against the projects illustrate. 
Banco Santander has a leading role in financing the dam building despite clear non-conformities with the Principles.
The bank adopted the Principles joining other Equator Principles Financial Institutions (EPFIs), in order to “ensure that the projects they finance are developed in a manner that is socially responsible and reflect sound environmental management practices.” In doing so, EPFIs commit to “avoiding negative impacts on project-affected ecosystems and communities.” Moreover, EPFIs commit to not providing “loans to projects where the borrower will not or is unable to comply with our respective social and environmental policies.” 
“Banco Santander’s financing to the Santo Antônio dam is enabling drastic environmental impacts to unfold in the Amazon,” says Roland Widmer, the manager of the Eco-Finance Program at the Friends of the Earth of the Brazilian Amazon. “There are serious irregularities in the dams’ environmental licensing process.  Also dam construction has already caused an environmental disaster, including the killing of over 11 tons of fish, which has led to fines of over R$ 9 million (US$ 4.26 million).  The region’s indigenous peoples say they have not been adequately consulted about the dams and have demanded that the licenses be revoked.”
Banco Santander has played a leading role in advising and coordinating the financial structure of Santo Antonio dam and holds a 5% equity stake in the project. In an April 30 press release, Santander claims that “social and environmental criteria will be applied globally to all new project finance lending and advisory activities across all industry sectors, in accordance with the Equator Principles declaration” confirming “the bank’s commitment to sustainable development worldwide.” However, with their intrinsic support for the Santo Antonio dam Santander is abandoning its adherence to social and environmental criteria as well as to sustainability.
The actual – and probable – environmental damages caused by the dams are in direct violation of Brazil’s constitution while the lack of the free, prior, and informed consent of the impacted indigenous communities breaches Convention 169 of the International Labor Organization, which was ratified by Brazil, as well as the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.
Glenn Switkes, the Director of the Amazon Program at International Rivers, commented, “Banco Santander’s support of the Santo Antonio dam is a clear contradiction to its stated aspirations for sustainability and social and environmental responsibility. There is no question that the Madeira dams violate the Equator Principles. Banco Santander should pull out of the Madeira complex.”

Tasmania, Australia ",World's major banks rule out financing Gunns' Pulp Mill,Barclays ,United Kingdom,Tamar Valley Pulp Mill Tasmania (formerly Gunns Pulp Mill) ,forestry - pulp and paper,Australia,"
In a
major development of the pulp mill campaign The Wilderness Society has released
a list of the world’s leading banks which have committed to not finance Gunns’
environmentally destructive pulp mill. The Wilderness Society, in conjunction
with GetUp and BankTrack, has ran a full page advertisement in the European
edition of the Financial Times pointing out why other banks should follow their
lead and commit to not financing the pulp mill.
 “Leading
international banks have committed to not finance Gunns’ socially and
environmentally destructive pulp mill. This is a major step forward towards
protecting Tasmania’s irreplaceable native forests and the livelihoods of
Tasmanians,” said Paul Oosting, pulp mill campaigner for The Wilderness
Society.
 “Banks
which were previously rumoured to be involved in financing the pulp mill, such
as Deutsche Bank, the Royal Bank of Scotland, and the Bank of China, are among
the banks which have committed to not finance the project,” said Mr Oosting.
 “It is
encouraging to see the finance sector recognising the risks associated with a
project like this, which would lock in the destruction of Tasmania’s forests
which contain massive amounts of carbon,” said Mr. Oosting.
 “No bank
that adheres to environmental and social guidelines would finance a project
that would be a major driver of climate change, wildlife loss and toxic
pollution,” said Mr Oosting.
 On April
29 a full-page advertisement has ran in the European Financial Times. The
following banks have not yet ruled out financing the pulp mill and will be
named in the advertisement:
* Nordea *
Barclays Bank*
Macquarie * JP
Morgan Chase
 “Gunns’
pulp mill does not have Federal Government approval to operate, is strongly
opposed by the public and still faces possible legal challenges. We want all
major banks to rule out financing the pulp mill,” said Mr Oosting.
 “The
Australian public is opposed to Gunns’ mill and running this advert in the
Financial Times will ensure that potential investors know why they should not
get involved with the most strongly opposed project in the country,” concluded
Mr Oosting.
The
following banks have committed not to finance Gunns’ pulp mill:
* Bank
of China *
Deutsche Bank* Royal
Bank of Scotland * HypoVereinsbank* Bank Austria * UBS* Erste Bank* Calyon* Banco

Geneva, Switzerland ",Oil and gas consortium will suspend seismic activities to protect gray whales,,,Sakhalin II oil and gas project ,oil and gas,Russian Federation,"
A major oil and gas consortium has agreed to suspend planned
seismic testing off Sakhalin Island in the Russian Far East, a crucial feeding
area for the critically endangered Western Gray whale.
The
decision followed a recommendation today by a major international scientific
panel to halt further oil and gas development in and around the feeding area of
the Western Gray Whale.
During a
meeting of the Western Gray Whale Advisory Panel (WGWAP), Sakhalin Energy - a
partnership between Shell, Gasprom and other shareholders - agreed to cancel
its proposed 2009 seismic activities, despite having already put plans in place
for the work. 
The
WGWAP, convened by the IUCN and comprising 11 eminent scientists, met this week
with representatives of Shell, Sakhalin Energy, Russian government officials,
project lenders and environmental NGOs to review the most recent science on the
whales. 
The
Western Gray Whale is one of the world’s most endangered whales, with only
about 25 breeding females remaining.  The
whale feeds only in the summer, and its crucial primary feeding area is
offshore Piltun Bay at the north eastern part of Sakhalin shelf.
New
science presented during this week’s meeting revealed a significant decline in
sightings and behaviour changes of the whales in their primary feeding area
near Piltun Bay. Oil and gas exploration activities in the area appear to have
displaced the whales to deeper areas offshore, making it more difficult for
whale calves to feed. 
Since
the Western Gray Whale only feeds in the summertime, such displacement could be
devastating.
However,
BP, Exxon, Rosneft have ignored repeated calls to cooperate with the panel,
which again today called on those companies to urgently follow the example of
Sakhalin Energy.
 “WWF lauds the responsible and forward looking
approach taken by Sakhalin Energy in heeding this call from the panel,” said
Aleksey Knizhnikov from WWF-Russia. “The results seen today demonstrate that
collaborative science based initiatives like this panel process can succeed –
even on issues as complex as oil and gas development”.  
“However
other major operators in the area – including major international giants BP and
Exxon - have completely ignored pleas to join the panel, disregarded advice on
how to mitigate the impacts of their activities, and refused to provide even
basic information on what their activities are in the region.” 
“Today’s
decision is a victory for the Western Gray Whales, but the struggle
continues.  BP, Exxon and Rosneft must
abandon their reckless plans that threaten the western gray whales with
extinction” said Doug Norlen, from Pacific Environment, an international NGO
that has monitored Sakhalin oil and gas projects for over a decade. 
Pacific
Environment and WWF are both members of BankTrack. "

London ",Campaigners demand RBS stop using tax money to destroy climate,Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS)  ,United Kingdom,,,,"
A coalition of environmental and development groups  are today calling on the Treasury, UKFI  and RBS to stop pouring public money into climate damaging fossil fuel projects around the world.  The groups have also instructed their lawyers to write to the Treasury to reveal what environmental assessment impact was made at the time of the recapitalisation, and to call for proper assessment and evaluation of the climate risks associated with the RBS loan portfolio.  RBS will be holding their AGM in Edinburgh this afternoon. A broad coalition of groups, including Friends of the Earth Scotland and the World Development Movement, are calling on the Treasury, UKFI and RBS to respond to recent criticisms in the media  and in Parliament  that public money is being used to finance new fossil fuel projects around the world without taking into account the impact on climate change. RBS has been the subject of climate controversy for being the UK high street bank most associated with fossil fuel financing. Since the initial recapitalisation took place in October 2008, research shows that the bank has taken part in loans worth almost £10 billion to companies involved in the oil, coal and gas industry. The loans included ones to controversial companies such as energy giant E.ON and a company building a gas pipe line as part of tar sands extraction in Canada. Duncan McLaren, Chief Executive of Friends of the Earth Scotland said, With the urgent threat of climate change looming so large, its nonsensical that tax-payers money is now being used to finance coal, oil and gas exploitation around the world. These state-owned banks should be required to invest in low-carbon infrastructure like renewable energy and public transport, instead of fossil fuels.Bronwen Smith-Thomas, of student campaign group People & Planet said, There have been literally hundreds of protests across the UK against RBS over its involvement in fossil fuel finance. The Treasury needs to step in and ensure that it adopts some sort of binding policy with regards to the devastating impact the bank's lending portfolio is having on climate change.  In March 2009, the Parliamentary Environmental Audit Committee issued a report that made the recommendation: The Government now has a controlling interest in a number of banks. We recommend that the Treasury examine and report on how some form of environmental criteria for the investment strategies pursued by these banks might be imposed, and what impacts this might have on UK sustainable development objectives. In light of this recommendation groups are calling on RBS to fully disclose its involvement in supporting fossil fuel companies and developments, through both corporate and project finance, and to cap and reduce the level of their involvement in successive years. The protest group People & Planet are also planning demonstrations outside the AGM in Edinburgh and the bank?s headquarters in Bishopsgate, London on the day. NOTES TO THE EDITOR  The groups involved include PLATFORM, Friends of the Earth Scotland, People & Planet, World Development Movement, BankTrack, London Mining Network, Indigenous Peoples Links and Scottish Education and Action for Development  UKFI UK Financial Investments ? the company set up by the Treasury to manage the public investment in the recapitalised banks  see  http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/mar/02/rbs-environmental-regulations   In February 2009, Martin Horwood, Lib Dem MP tabled an Early Day Motion that ?calls on the Government to use its majority share in RBS to prioritise climate change as a principal concern in RBS's lending decisions. http://edmi.parliament.uk/EDMi/EDMDetails.aspx?EDMID=37959&SESSION=899  A report published in August 2008 detailing the involvement of UK banks in the global coal industry, found that RBS, Barclays and HSBC were all heavily implicated in providing funding to coal projects and companies.  Of these three banks, RBS had the highest involvement with the coal industry.  Between May 2006 and April 2008, HSBC was involved three times in coal loans, Barclays 17 times and RBS 27 times.  The total value of the loans was $38 billion for Barclays, $71 billion for HSBC and $96 billion for RBS.  http://www.carbonweb.org/showitem.asp?article=338&parent=39  see http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/mar/02/rbs-environmental-regulations  see point 33 of   http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmenvaud/202/202.pdf "

Bonn, Nijmegen ",Carbon Principles and Climate Principles will not stop melting of the ice,Bank of America ,United States,,,,"
 
A new report by
BankTrack, ‘Meek Principles for a Tough Climate’,
launched today at the start of climate convention negotiations in Bonn
concludes that commercial banks must collectively commit to bolder action to
avoid financing catastrophic climate change.
The
‘Carbon Principles’ and the ‘Climate Principles’, the only two collective
climate initiatives taken so far by banks, are considered to be too focused on
accommodating business as usual and therefore inadequate as a response to the
urgent challenge posed by accelerating climate change.
The
new report analyses in detail what strengths and weaknesses are contained in
the two sets of Principles, which were both launched last year.
“BankTrack
welcomes the fact that the signatories to the Carbon Principles and the Climate
Principles acknowledge that they must do their part in combating climate
change. Given the large climate impacts of the finance sector's role in
mobilizing and allocating capital and investment for high carbon activities,
there is a compelling need for a robust sector-wide climate safeguard standards
and code of conduct for the banking sector.
However,
both the Climate Principles and the Carbon Principles are deeply disappointing.
While they both contain elements that are useful, neither addresses climate
change risks of bank financing with the rigor, urgency or ambition that the
challenge at hand plainly requires.
To
appropriately respond to this challenge, financial institutions must adopt
strong climate protection performance policies and strategic objectives,
combined with climate management tools and oversight mechanisms that are at
least as comprehensive and rigorous as those that they already use to ensure
compliance with other corporate policies and strategic objectives, such as
their credit rating and risk management frameworks or their human resources
policies”
Neither
the Carbon Principles nor the Climate Principles actually set performance
standards to reduce the risks to the climate from their financing. Rather, they
focus on reducing the risks to the banks from climate change and/or the
uncertainty around anticipated regulatory responses to climate change”, said
Bill Barclay, global energy and finance campaigner with the Rainforest Action
Network, present in Bonn.
“Much stronger leadership on climate is required”.
Johan Frijns, BankTrack coordinator said; “We do not expect banks to take
full responsibility for solving the climate crisis, but it is an undeniable
fact that the way banks choose to invest will make a huge difference to the
climate. Serious climate policies must lead to serious shifts in their
portfolios, away from fossil fuel extraction, towards investments that will
stimulate the emergence of a global low carbon economy.”

Citi, Credit Suisse, Wells Fargo, JPMorganChase, Morgan Stanley
The Climate Principles can be

Washington D.C. ",New report sounds alarm on subprime carbon and the need to regulate carbon markets,,,,,,"
If it is not structured properly, global warming
legislation could lead to the creation of an enormous, poorly regulated
derivatives market with failures mirroring those that led to the current
financial crisis, according to a report released today by Friends of the Earth
U.S.
The report, Subprime Carbon? Re-thinking the World’s
Largest New Derivatives Market, finds that existing financial regulations, as
well as those in major cap-and-trade bills, are inadequate to govern carbon
trading, creating a potentially huge regulatory gap.
“Global warming has reached a crisis point, and it’s
imperative that Congress move quickly to put solutions in place, but it’s also
important to be careful and do this the right way from the start,” said
Michelle Chan, a senior policy analyst at Friends of the Earth and the author
of the report. “If we aren’t careful, we could end up creating a massive,
poorly regulated derivatives market that not only poses risks to the broader
financial markets, but also undermines efforts to save the climate.”
The report outlines how lessons from the current
financial crisis apply to carbon markets, which could become the largest
derivatives markets in the world. In particular, it raises concerns about
“subprime carbon,” risky carbon credits based on uncompleted offset projects (projects
designed to sequester or reduce greenhouse gases). Subprime carbon credits may
ultimately fail to reduce greenhouse gases and, like subprime mortgages, could
collapse in value, yet they are already being securitized and resold in
secondary markets. The report recommends that lawmakers include carbon trading
in current debates about financial reform, and warns against hastily creating
carbon markets without proper oversight.
“Fortunately, there are ways to minimize the
environmental and financial risks of carbon trading, including prohibiting
offsets and creating a stable price path for carbon,” Chan said. “We should
also avoid putting all our eggs in one basket. Although many lawmakers are
talking about carbon trading as if it’s the only way to reduce greenhouse
gases, no single approach will solve climate change—a diverse set of
complementary strategies is needed.” "

Brussels ",BNP Paribas: very high risk of harmful investments,Belfius ,Belgium,,,,"
Customers of BNP Paribas run a very high risk of harmful
investments. This is revealed in new research that forms part of the
""Banking Secrets"" campaign of Netwerk Vlaanderen. The French bank
owns or manages 657 million dollars in shares of ten companies that harm people
and the environment, such as mining company Barrick Gold and Freeport McMoran.
Netwerk Vlaanderen conducted research into the harmful investments made by AXA,
Citibank, Dexia, Deutsche Bank, ING, KBC and Triodos Bank regarding
environment, peace, freedom & democracy and decent working conditions. The
results are disappointing.
 “The government
must urgently put conditions in place for support for banks. Only the
banks  that put a stop to harmful
investments should be eligible for government support"", according to
Mathias Bienstman, campaigner with Netwerk Vlaanderen.
BNP Paribas scores badly in ethical ranking of banks.
The Banking Secrets research conducted by Netwerk
Vlaanderen includes a ranking of the banks and their harmful investments. BNP
Paribas makes an entry to this ranking in a very bad  position. Customers of the French bank run a
very high risk of harmful investments. BNP Paribas is active in the financing
of the most damaging mining projects, such as the projects undertaken by
Barrick Gold, Freeport McMoran and Vedanta. BNP Paribas has extended credit to
all of these companies, and also issued bonds in Barrick Gold. Furthermore, BNP
Paribas owns or manages 657 million dollar worth of shares in these three
companies and seven other controversial companies: Anglogold Ashanti, EADS,
GAIL, Goldcorp, Newmont Mining, Total and Wal-Mart.
Harmful investments of other large banks
The research also shows that AXA, ING, Dexia, KBC,
Deutsche Bank, Citibank and BNP Paribas hold a combined total of more than 14
billion dollars investments in 14 companies that harm people and the
environment. There are clear differences amongst the researched banks. Deutsche
bank, Citibank and BNP Paribas are very active in the financing of damaging
companies via extending credits, issuing bonds and owning or managing shares.
Dexia and KBC are hardly active in these markets. The new results are displayed
on the website www.banksecrets.be. A world map shows the various projects and
companies that harm people and the planet, and the banks that invest in them.
Need for government intervention
The CEOs of the large banks are giving evidence in the
Belgian parliament. Netwerk Vlaanderen asks that attention is not only directed
to speculative investments that were more risky than expected. Banks have been
investing for many years in business practices that contravene national laws or
international agreements regarding human rights and the environment. “It is now
up to the government to place conditions on the support and guarantees that it
is giving  to the banks. Respect for
minimum norms regarding environmental, social and governance is one field.
Banks can show this by putting far-reaching and transparent policies in
place"", according to Mathias Bienstman from Netwerk Vlaanderen. "

Istanbul ",Turkey deports international rivers' staff after peaceful water forum protest against Ilisu Dam,,,Ilisu dam ,energy plants - dams,Turkey,"
Two International Rivers' staff members
were arrested and detained today for unfurling a banner at the opening ceremony
of the World Water Forum (WWF) in Istanbul. They will be deported tomorrow
morning or face a year in Turkish prison.
As the opening ceremony of the WWF began, International
Rivers' South Asia Director Ann-Kathrin Schneider and Climate Campaigner Payal
Parekh unfurled a banner reading ""No Risky Dams"" in protest at the
World Water Forum's promotion of destructive dams. They shouted slogans as the
chair of the World Water Forum and government dignitaries were about to take
the stage.
While many WWF participants applauded the protest, the police
detained the two protestors. Meanwhile, outside the conference center riot
police used water cannons and tear gas against 150 peaceful protestors who
shouted ""water for life, not for profit"" in opposition to the WWF's
agenda of water privatization and river destruction. Seventeen protestors were
arrested.
As she was being detained, Payal Parekh said: ""Large
dams have left a legacy of lies and loss. Continuing to build destructive dams
will bring unacceptable risks to people and the planet.""
Ann-Kathrin Schneider said as she unfurled the banner:
""The Ilisu Dam in Southeast Turkey is a symbol of outmoded water and
energy policies which destroy communities and the environment. We call on the
participants of the World Water Forum to embrace smarter and cleaner solutions
which are readily available.""
Peter Bosshard, International Rivers Policy Director,
whose Opinion Piece on the World Water Forum and large dams was published in
today's Turkish Daily News,
said ""The response by the Turkish authorities highlights the undemocratic
nature of the World Water Forum. Two protestors being deported for unfurling a
banner is unacceptable. We call on the World Water Council to respect and
support the rights of all people to speak freely and protest peacefully.""
The World Water Forum takes place every three years. It
is organized by the World Water Council, a private organization whose most
influential members are private water companies and some of the world's biggest
dam construction companies, funders and government agencies.
Based on five continents, International
rivers is an international environmental
and human rights organization. For over two decades, International Rivers has
been at the heart of the global struggle to protect rivers and the communities
that depend on them. "

London ",Major banks facilitate corruption in world's poorest countries  government regulation is not working,Banco Santander ,Spain,,,,"
As G20 finance ministers meet in London to discuss how to rescue the global financial system and prevent the next disaster, a new report by anti-corruption NGO Global Witness shows how some of the world’s biggest banks have been dealing with some of the world’s most corrupt regimes. 
By doing so they have facilitated corruption and looting of natural resource revenues, denying some of the world’s poorest people a chance to escape poverty.
‘The same lax regulation that created the credit crunch has let some of the world's biggest banks facilitate the looting of natural resource wealth from poor countries,’ said Gavin Hayman, Global Witness Campaigns Director. ‘If resources like oil, gas and minerals are to truly help lift Africa and other poor regions out of poverty, then governments must take responsibility to stop banks doing business with corrupt dictators and their families.’ 
The facts
Global Witness’s report, Undue Diligence: How banks do business with corrupt regimes, presents evidence that:
* Barclays kept open an account for the son of the dictator of oil-rich Equatorial Guinea long after clear evidence emerged that his family were heavily involved in substantial looting of state oil revenues.
* A British tax haven and a Hong Kong bank helped the son of the president of Republic of Congo, another oil-rich African country, spend hundreds of thousands of dollars of his country’s oil revenues on designer shopping sprees.
* Citibank facilitated the funding of two vicious civil wars in Sierra Leone and Liberia by enabling the warlord Charles Taylor, now on trial for war crimes in the Hague, to loot timber revenues.
* HSBC and Banco Santander hid behind bank secrecy laws in Luxembourg and Spain to frustrate US efforts to find out if Equatorial Guinea’s oil revenues had been looted and laundered.
* Deutsche Bank assisted the late president Niyazov of Turkmenistan, a notorious human rights abuser, to keep billions of dollars of state gas revenues under his personal control and off the national budget.
* Dozens of British, European and Chinese banks have provided Angola’s opaque national oil company, Sonangol, with billions of dollars of oil backed loans, though there is no transparency or democratic oversight about how these advances on the country's oil revenues are used, and they have a recent history mired in corruption and secret arms deals. 
What needs to be done
No bank should be, or should want to be, involved in business such as this, whose real costs are borne by the people of some of the world’s poorest countries.
Anti-money laundering laws require banks to do due diligence to identify their customer and turn down illicitly-acquired funds, but these laws need tightening to make them globally effective. The following four reforms to the financial regulatory system are essential:
* Banks must change their culture of ‘due diligence’ – the process by which they check that a customer is legitimate. This isn’t about box ticking. Banks should only take the business if they have identified an ultimate beneficiary who does not pose a corruption risk. Other business should be turned away.
* Governments must ensure that anti-money laundering laws in each jurisdiction are absolutely explicit that banks must do this due diligence properly, and financial regulators must actively enforce these laws.
* Cooperation between governments has to improve to ensure that national bank regulations become globally compatible, accountable and transparent, and are not hindered by bank secrecy laws. This must begin with reforms to the inter-governmental body that oversees the anti-money laundering regime, the Financial Action Task Force.
* Governments must ensure that new global rules are put in place to help banks avoid corrupt funds. The most important change is to ensure that every country produces full public online registers of the ultimate beneficial ownership of all companies and trusts under its jurisdiction, to help banks identify and avoid business with a corruption risk.
‘The G20 leaders must act on their promises to help the world's poor. A key element of making poverty history is to stop the money being stolen or kept off-budget in the first place. Ducking this issue now leaves the global financial system open not only to further corrupt money flows, but to the destabilising influences that have caused such damage to the developed world’s economies,’ said Hayman. ‘The developing world cannot afford a return to business as usual.’ "

Bucharest ","Cernavoda nuclear reactor too dangerous to build, says new report",,,Cernavoda nuclear power plant (units 3 & 4) ,energy plants - nuclear,Romania,"
Greenpeace is calling on Romania to abandon its plans to build two new Candu-6 reactors at Cernovoda in response to a recently released Greenpeace commissioned report that finds the Canadian reactor design is unsafe and too dangerous to build according to modern safety standards.
“The Cernavoda reactors do not meet modern standards. The Romanian Government and the project companies must abandon their plans to proceed with the construction of Cernavoda 3 and 4,"" said Crisanta Lungu, an energy campaigner with Greenpeace in Romania.
The report, ""The Risks of Operating Candu 6 Nuclear Power Plants"" was presented to the press in Romania today during a press conference with videolinks to Canada and the USA. It warns that countries like Romania wanting to construct CANDU-6 reactors would have to forgo thorough safety reviews. These include standards intended to prevent catastrophic radiation releases from terrorist attacks or accidents.
The study, carried out by Dr. Gordon R. Thompson of the Institute for Resource and Security Studies in Massachusetts, USA, highlights a litany of problems with the CANDU-6 design, including:

The same design flaw that contributed to the Chernobyl explosion and to the world’s first nuclear accident in 1952 at AECL´s Chalk River laboratories. This design flaw does not meet modern safety standards.


The CANDU-6 would not resist a terrorist attack and would not meet post-9/11 safety standards.


The occurrence of external events like earthquakes, quite common in this part of Romania, are not taken sufficiently into account in risk calculations for CANDU-6 reactors.


Its emergency shut-down systems are untested and unproven. Confidence in the ability of these systems to operate in accident situations is low.


Its use of natural uranium and online fueling makes it attractive to countries hoping to acquire the capacity to divert plutonium from used fuel to build atomic weapons. India used a Canadian reactor to build an atomic bomb; AECL stated late last year it would like to sell additional reactors to India and is using possible construction of CANDU-6 reactors in Cernavoda as marketing argument for its international sales.

Based on Dr. Thompson’s findings, Greenpeace is recommending full risk assessments before the licensing and construction of the reactors is permitted and a formal request for such assessments to the Romanian government, Romanian Nuclear Regulatory Agency, the European Commission, the companies involved in the construction of Cernavoda 3 and 4.
""Because the CANDU-6 shares a fatal design flaw with the Chernobyl reactors, safety regulators in the Germany and the USA would never allow it to be built. If Romania continues the construction of Cernavoda 3 and 4, it clearly considers its population to be second class citizens that can be served with a second class nuclear power station,"" said Jan Haverkamp, nuclear energy expert for Greenpeace Europe.
Greenpeace notes that Canadian province of Ontario, the birthplace of the CANDU-6 design, abandoned its plan to build a new CANDU-6 in 2006 because of the design changes required for the CANDU-6 to meet modern standards. ""In a post September 11th, post Chernobyl world, Canada should not export a reactor deemed too dangerous to build here at home,"" Shawn-Patrick Stensil, Greenpeace energy campaigner in Canada.
The report was written by Gordon Thompson, a nuclear expert and professor at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. He was educated in Australia and the UK, in engineering and science, obtaining his doctorate from Oxford University in 1973.
Last month, Greenpeace Europe filed a complaint on with the European Commission over alleged illegal state aid for the construction of additional CANDU-6 reactors at Cernavoda.
 
NOTES TO THE EDITOR:
The project companies involved in the construction plans of Cernavoda 3 and 4 are the 100% state owned Romanian utility SN Nuclearelectrica A.S., GdF Suez / Electrabel from France, RWE from Germany, CEZ from the Czech Republic, ENEL from Italy, Iberdrola from Spain and Arcelor-Mital from India.

São Paulo- Brazil ",Polêmicas ambientais e crise afastam financiamento de investidores privados,Banco Santander ,Spain,Rio Madeira dams: Jirau and Santo Antonio ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"
Seis meses após o início das obras da hidrelétrica de
Santo Antônio, os bancos Santander e Banif, que participam com 20% da Saesa,
empresa que constrói a usina, ainda não conseguiram investidores para o
empreendimento. É o que afirma
Roberto Simões, presidente da Saesa.
Santander
e Banif decidiram entrar como sócios por meio de um FIP (Fundo de Investimento
Privado). O objetivo era vender as cotas do fundo e ficar no projeto como
gestores. Os cotistas seriam os responsáveis pelos aportes de capital.
Os
bancos privados estão relutantes em participar do FIP. O prazo de financiamento
seria longo demais, os retornos do investimento, duvidosos (devido às previsões
de queda no preço da energia no mercado livre), e os riscos socioambientais,
elevados.
Além
disso, organizações civis questionam a participação dessas instituições,
principalmente as signatárias dos Princípios do Equador -práticas definidas
pelo Banco Mundial que recomendam a não-concessão de financiamentos a projetos
cujo impacto socioambiental não é devidamente calculado ou mitigado.
É o caso
de Bradesco, Unibanco e Banco do Brasil, que, para Roland Widmer, gerente da
Oscip Amigos da Terra, estão em desacordo com suas políticas de
sustentabilidade ao participarem do projeto como repassadores de recursos do
BNDES (Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econômico e Social). Consultados, os
bancos afirmam que o protocolo dá flexibilidade para que se retirem em caso de
problemas, inexistentes até o momento.
O MPF
(Ministério Publico Federal) de Rondônia também está monitorando a participação
dessas instituições e suspeita de irregularidades no Banco da Amazônia, que
aprovou financiamento de R$ 503 milhões para a Saesa.
O banco
estatal usou recursos do FNO (Fundo Constitucional do Norte) e o valor máximo
permitido seria de R$ 159 milhões. O FNO é alimentado pela arrecadação de
impostos. O diretor comercial do Banco da Amazônia, Gilvandro Negrão, afirmou à
Folha que o limite seria de R$ 445 milhões para um período de três anos. Ainda
assim, esse teto foi ultrapassado em R$ 58 milhões, diferença que, segundo ele,
será coberta com recursos próprios.
O MPF
determinou que o Banco da Amazônia enviasse os documentos desse financiamento. O
banco negou, alegando sigilo comercial. Até o momento, as usinas hidrelétricas
do rio Madeira estão sendo custeadas basicamente com dinheiro público.

Les scientifiques de l’UICN chargés de surveiller les impacts du projet pétrolier et gazier de Sakhaline II, dans l’extrême-orient russe, lancent un cri d’alarme devant la réduction anormale du nombre de baleines grises occidentales à l’été 2008. Le nouveau rapport de l’UICN confirme les craintes des ONG qui mettent en garde les acteurs de ce projet controversé depuis des années. Les Amis de la Terre demandent à nouveau à BNP Paribas de se retirer du projet.
Sakhaline II est le projet pétrolier et gazier intégré le plus important au monde. Il est situé sur l’île de Sakhaline, dans l’extrême-orient russe, et devrait coûter plus de 22 milliards de dollars. Depuis ses débuts en 1994, il suscite d’innombrables critiques, concernant à la fois ses impacts environnementaux sur l’écosystème de la région ainsi que ses impacts sociaux sur les communautés locales affectées par le projet.
C’est précisément l’un de ces impacts qui a alerté les scientifiques du comité d’experts scientifiques de l’UICN chargé d’étudier l’impact du projet sur les derniers spécimens de baleines grises occidentales de la planète. Comme l’explique Sébastien Godinot, coordinateur des campagnes aux Amis de la Terre : « Leur dernier rapport est sans appel (1). Les scientifiques ont observé à l’été 2008 un déclin massif du nombre de baleines grises occidentales, dont il ne reste plus que 130 spécimens, venant s’alimenter presque exclusivement près du projet pétrolier et gazier offshore au nord-est de l’île de Sakhaline. Les scientifiques demandent désormais un moratoire immédiat sur toutes les activités industrielles terrestres et maritimes qui pourraient venir perturber ces baleines, afin d’éviter l’extinction définitive de l’espèce ».
Cette mise en garde n’est que la dernière d’une longue série et confirme les craintes des ONG depuis des années. Les scientifiques dénoncent ainsi les entreprises qui exploitent le projet, au premier rang desquelles Sakhalin Energy (Gazprom et Shell), qui refuse de fournir certaines données au Panel d’experts. Ses pratiques sont perpétuellement remises en cause, notamment la vitesse élevée de ses bateaux ou la réalisation de tests sismiques dans la région. Toutes ces mises en garde n’ont pourtant pas empêché plusieurs banques françaises de financer le projet, comme le rappelle Yann Louvel, chargé de campagne Finance privée aux Amis de la Terre : « La Société Générale avait déjà accordé un prêt massif d’un milliard de dollars à Gazprom en 2007 pour financer son entrée dans le projet. BNP Paribas a même décidé de financer directement le projet lui-même en 2008, quelques mois seulement avant de signer les Principes d’Equateur qui devraient au contraire l’éloigner de ce type de projet. Ce financement est conditionné au soutien du Panel de scientifiques au projet : la condition n°35 oblige Sakhalin Energy à suivre les recommandations des scientifiques, et à communiquer tous les éléments nécessaires à leurs études en temps convenu, une condition allègrement violée aujourd’hui. Les Amis de la Terre demandent donc à BNP Paribas de se retirer immédiatement du projet ».

Beijing, China ",Paper group listing is forest unfriendly,,,Asia Pulp and Paper (APP) ,forestry - pulp and paper,Indonesia,"
  
We’re hoping it’s not bad news for China’s
forests, but the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) posted a worrying
statement today on paper giant APP’s Chinese subsidiary, Gold East Paper.
Gold East Paper wants to list on the Shanghai Stock Exchange
and it’s the MEP’s job to say yes or no.
Days after they submitted their application last August,
Greenpeace and several environmental groups including Global Village, Friends of
Nature, Green SOS and Green Watershed, compiled a list of environmental
concerns about Gold East Paper and sent it to the MEP.
We asked the MEP to carefully consider Gold East Paper’s
application in light of the fact that it and its seven subsidiaries in China are connected with a number of serious
environmental offences – a lot of them associated with pollution from pulping
plants and also illegal logging in Yunnan and Hainan provinces.
The MEP generally takes a month or so at most to consider a
listing request. It’s well over six months since Gold East Paper put in its
application. This is encouraging since it appears the MEP is taking the
environmental accusations seriously.
However the MEP published a statement on their website today
that says after careful investigation by local environmental bureaux, they feel
that Gold East Paper has addressed these environmental concerns. In fact, it
says, Gold East Paper has invested more than 100 million yuan over the past two
years to clean up its act.
However, when it comes to the environment, just pumping
money into projects is not the only answer. We want to see real evidence that
Gold East Paper is not going to harm China’s forests and illegally
pollute its water.
Just last October a Greenpeace investigation in Hainan found that villagers there were complaining of
severely polluted well water which they blamed on a pulping factory owned by
one of Gold East Paper’s subsidiaries.
We are also concerned that Gold East Paper has not yet come
up with a satisfactory answer to securing a sustainable supply of wood.
By listing on the stock exchange, Gold East Paper aims to
use the money raised into expanding its China operations. And as far as we
understand, this can’t be done sustainably with local wood sources.
How can we let a company tainted by pollution and illegal
logging scandals expand further in China? "

Brussels ",Greenpeace files illegal state aid complaint for construction of nuclear plants in Romania and Bulgaria,,,Belene nuclear power plant ,energy plants - nuclear,Bulgaria,"
Greenpeace has filed complaints to the European Commission over alleged illegal state aid for the construction of two nuclear reactors in Romania and two in Bulgaria. The environmental organisation argues that both countries violate EU competition rules.Jan Haverkamp, EU energy campaigner for Greenpeace, said: ""We have been investigating for many months the unfair competition conditions that have been granted to the nuclear sector in Romania and Bulgaria. We have now submitted the evidence we have collected to the European Commission, and are calling for urgentaction to correct these flagrant market distortions.""
The Romanian government earmarked €220 million for the Cernavoda 3 and 4 nuclear power plant. On top of this, the state spent €350 million in taxpayers’ money for the purchase of heavy water for the new power station, as well as €800 million toincrease the capital of state utility S.N. Nuclearelectrica – S.A., with the purpose of supporting its financial contributions to the project. (1)
The Bulgarian government has invested 300 million Bulgarian Leva (€154 million) in state utility NEK for the construction of the Belene nuclear power station, as well as another 400 million Leva (€205 million) in NEK's parent holding BEH, partly also meant for Belene. (2)
According to Greenpeace, all of these investments are in violation of EU competition law.
Crisanta Lungu, Greenpeace energy campaigner in Romania, said: ""It is particularly important that taxpayers’ money is spent wisely in economically difficult times. Investments in energy efficiency and renewables would bring more jobs and more energy security. Instead, Romania’s nuclear industry is swallowing investments uplike a black hole.""
Denitza Petrova, from the Green Policy Institute in Sofia, Bulgaria, said: ""There is still very little support from the government for energy efficiency and renewables, even though Bulgaria uses up to four times as much energy per GDP as the EU average.Nuclear subsidies harm the healthy development of our energy sector.""

Washington DC ",Landmark Global Warming Lawsuit Settled,,,,,,"
A federal lawsuit that sought to force two U.S. agencies to address the global warming implications of their overseas financing activities was settled today after more than six years; the suit established important legal precedents related to global warming.Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and the city of Boulder, Colorado, filed the suit (Friends of the Earth, Inc., et al. v. Spinelli, et al.) in August 2002 and were later joined by the California cities of Arcata, Santa Monica and Oakland.
The plaintiffs alleged that Export-Import Bank of the United States and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation illegally provided more than $32 billion in financing and insurance to fossil fuel projects over 10 years without assessing whether the projects contributed to global warming or impacted the U.S. environment, as they were required to do under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Fossil fuel projects financed by the two agencies from 1990 to 2003 produced cumulative emissions that were equivalent to nearly eight percent of the world’s annual carbon dioxide emissions, or nearly one third of annual U.S. emissions in 2003.
In August 2005, a federal judge found that the U.S. cities suffering economic and other damages from climate change had standing to sue under NEPA, opening up the courthouse doors for the first time to those injured by climate change. Testimony from the case, which successfully asserted that climate change is real and caused by human activities, later informed the Mass. v EPA decision, in which the Supreme Court held that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are pollutants that can be regulated under the Clean Air Act.
Under the settlement agreed to today, the Export-Import Bank will begin taking carbon dioxide emissions into account in evaluating fossil fuel projects and create an organization-wide carbon policy. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation will establish a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with projects by 20 percent over the next ten years. Both agencies will commit to increasing financing for renewable energy.
The settlement represents an important victory in the continuing campaign to hold both agencies accountable for their contributions to climate change. The settlement agreement was filed this morning in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs in the suit were represented by the law firm of Shems Dunkiel Kassel & Saunders PLLC (Burlington, Vermont) and Natural Heritage Institute (San Francisco, California).
Reactions from the plaintiffs:
“This settlement is a substantial victory for our climate. It will force federal agencies to move away from fossil fuel projects and account for the climate impacts of their lending. As President Obama said in his inaugural address, 'We can no longer consume the world’s resources without regard to effect.' The settlement agreed to today is a first step toward making Obama's vision a reality for these institutions.” 
— Michelle Chan, Senior Policy Analyst, Friends of the Earth
“When we launched this lawsuit in 2003, we were deep in the Bush global warming dark ages. We were able to prove that climate change harms American cities and citizens and we forced these agencies to change their behavior. Now that we have entered the brighter Obama age, Greenpeace hopes that sweeping reform of global warming policy will reach every corner of the government.”
— Kert Davies, Research Director, Greenpeace
“This case was one of the very first climate change lawsuits and established the framework for other climate change cases. The claims here are no longer considered novel. The settlement reached today will help ensure that the federal government takes a close look at its contributions to climate change and that the courts are available if the government fails in this critical obligation.”
— Ron Shems, lead council for the plaintiffs
“For far too long, American tax dollars have funded highly irresponsible and damaging fossil fuel projects in countries where environmental laws simply don’t exist. These projects have not only hurt people in those countries—they have also contributed significantly to global climate change, and in doing so, pose a direct threat to the American people, the U.S. economy and the residents of Oakland. This settlement represents a major step in the campaign to bring real transparency and responsible environmental standards to energy projects subsidized by our tax dollars. On behalf of the residents of Oakland, California, I want to thank Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and the other plaintiffs for their work on this important case.”
— Oakland City Attorney John Russo
“The city of Boulder is pleased with the outcome of this lawsuit. As the first city to enact a carbon tax to address climate change, the Boulder community is committed to the principles of environmental sustainability and this result will further that impact. The coalition forged in the lawsuit demonstrates that together, committed organizations can make a positive difference toward protecting our planet.”
— Boulder City Manager Jane S. Brautigam
“The Arcata community is committed to leaving future generations a safer, cleaner planet. This landmark victory reflects how local leadership can take small steps to chart a more sustainable path. We are proud to have been part of this forward thinking coalition and will work to raise awareness about the need for immediate and long term actions to mitigate our global footprint.” 
— Arcata Mayor Mark Wheetley
“Santa Monica has a strong commitment to protecting our environment. Our participation in this case and the important settlement that was achieved results from our continuing advocacy of sound environmental stewardship.”
— Santa Monica Mayor Ken Genser "

Amsterdam ",Maatschappelijk Verantwoord Beleggen,ASN Bank ,Netherlands,,,,"
De financiële wereld verkeert in zwaar weer. Banken hebben de afgelopen jaren onverantwoorde financiële risico’s genomen met verstrekkende negatieve gevolgen voor het vertrouwen binnen de financiële sector zelf, maar ook onder consumenten. Naast financiële risico´s hebben banken ook te maken met milieu-, sociaaleconomische en politieke risico’s. Uit nieuw onderzoek van SOMO naar de beleggingen van de vijf grootste Nederlandse retailbanken en twee duurzame banken blijkt dat, ondanks de omvangrijke duurzaamheidsverslagen en de ruime keuze aan duurzame beleggingsproducten, maatschappelijk verantwoord beleggen bij de grote Nederlandse banken nog in de kinderschoenen staat.

De banken ING en ABN AMRO bijvoorbeeld, met meer dan een biljoen op de balans, belegde in 2007 slechts een half procent of minder in verantwoorde beleggingen. De duurzame banken Triodos en ASN Bank beleggen 100 procent duurzaam. Door hun geringe vermogen bleef de omvang van de totale duurzame beleggingen in Nederland in 2007 echter beperkt tot 3,2 procent.
De grote Nederlandse banken hebben allen een omvangrijk beleid op het gebied van maatschappelijk verantwoord ondernemen. SOMO-onderzoek wijst echter uit dat dit beleid nauwelijks van toepassing is op beleggingen en al helemaal niet op beleggingen die de banken in beheer hebben voor klanten. Alle banken bieden klanten de mogelijkheid duurzaam te beleggen. Maar moeten klanten de mogelijkheid krijgen, zoals nu vaak het geval is, om te beleggen in bedrijven die betrokken zijn bij mensenrechtenschendingen in Sudan? En hoe verhoudt dat zich tot het algemene mensenrechtenbeleid van banken? SOMO-onderzoeker Roos van Os: “ING geeft bijvoorbeeld aan dat zij de Universele Verklaring van de Rechten van de Mens onderschrijft en de mensenrechten wil respecteren bij al haar wereldwijde activiteiten. Waarom zijn dan een groot deel van de beleggingen hiervan uitgesloten?”  
De Nederlandse overheid is terughoudend met het reguleren van MVO-prestaties van banken en andere bedrijven en stelt veel vertrouwen in het zelfregulerende vermogen van de markt. Door de beperkte toepassing van MVO-beleid in de financiële sector is het voor consumenten, die hun keuze voor een bepaalde bank willen baseren op MVO-beleid en duurzame prestaties, heel moeilijk om na te gaan wat de exacte reikwijdte en toepassing is van dit beleid. Daarbij is transparantie van banken over de reikwijdte en toepassing van hun beleid essentieel om het huidige duurzaamheidsbeleid van banken in de praktijk te kunnen beoordelen.

Vienna, Berlin, Berne ",Ilisu Dam Project facing severe backlash,,,Ilisu dam ,energy plants - dams,Turkey,"
The European Ilisu
Campaign welcomed the historic announcement by the German, Austrian and Swiss
Governments to pull out of the Ilisu Dam project in Turkey after 180 days and claimed a
landmark campaign victory. This unprecedented withdrawal reflects the serious
social, cultural and environmental damage posed by the proposed dam. It is the
first time that an agreed export credit guarantee has been suspended by any
European Government. However, the European lisu Campaign remains concerned that
the final withdrawal can only take place after a 180 day period.
""We are delighted
and welcome this necessary and courageous step by the three governments. We
will do everything to ensure that the withdrawal will be completed after the
180 day period"", declared the members of the European Ilisu Campaign -
""CounterCurrent""of Germany,
ECA-Watch Austria,
and the Berne Declaration of Switzerland. These non-government organisations
announced that they will step up their work in Turkey to have the Ilisu region
recognised and listed as a UNESCO World Cultural and Natural Heritage site.
This decision of the
German, Austrian and Swiss Governments means that the delivery contracts of the
European construction companies - Andritz in Austria, Zueblin AG in Germany, ,
and Alstom in Switzerland - have been suspended thus stopping themfrom
proceeding with any project deliveries. Furthermore, the European banks - Bank
Austria/UniCredit, DekaBank and Société Générale - cannot disburse the loans
they approved. This will leave the project a shortfall of 500 million Euros
which will be very difficult for Turkey to raise - especially in the
wake of the financial crisis. With this important decision officially labelling
the Ilisu Dam Project as deficient, it is much more likely that the Tigris valley at Ilisu will be saved. The decision will
further strengthen the national campaign inside Turkey which had already been
boosted by the backing of prominent national actors and musicians.
Despite Turkey´s voiced
intent to go ahead with the construction under any circumstances, other
potential financiers will be much more careful to get involved and expose
themselves to strong international criticism. The proposed Ilisu Dam would
displace approximately 65,000 people, destroy 400 km of river ecosystems and
threaten numerous species. Approximately 300 important archaeological sites
would be submerged in the reservoir including Hasankeyf, one of the oldest
permanently inhabited towns on the planet.

London, U.K. ",Campaigners demand UK coal company withdraw support for destructive Bangladeshi mine,,,Phulbari coal mine ,mining - coal ,Bangladesh,"
Bangladeshi activists, and campaigners from the London Mining Network and the World Development Movement are protesting outside UK coal company, Global Coal Management PLC's AGM today demanding an end to its destructive coal mining operation in Bangladesh. The meeting will be held at 10.00 a.m. at Sceptre Court, 40 Tower Hill, London EC3. ""Phulbari is a splendid example of a project that should not go ahead. The fact that it is being proposed by a London-based company and has been supported by the British Government's Department for International Development shows why we in London have to increase pressure on companies and government to act responsibly"" said Richard Solly, Co-ordinator of the London Mining Network.Murray Benham, Head of Campaigns at the World Development Movement said:
""Open cast mining will destroy the livelihoods of tens of thousands of  people.  We are here to demonstrate our opposition to this disgraceful project,  proposed by a British company, and supported by the British government. Such a scheme should have no place in 21st century energy production.""GCM Resources has been preparing the 6,000 hectare, open-cast coal mine in the northwest area of Bangladesh for over 3 years. Eighty percent of the land that would be taken for the project is agricultural land and would force the eviction, relocation and re-employment of at least 40,000 people and disrupt the water supply of a further 100,000 people.“GCM does not have any lawful contract for mining coal in Phulbari,” said Professor Anu Muhammad, Member Secretary of the National Committee to Protect Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources in Bangladesh. “Moreover, after the community’s unprecedented resistance against the Phulbari coal mine project, the government signed an agreement with the people to cancel all contracts with the company and to ban open-pit mining in the country. In Phulbari and in general throughout the country, people have issued a public verdict against the company; they have given their lives to resist the company because of the disastrous nature of this project.”“The project’s Environmental and Social Impact Assessment is full of vague assurances,” said Roger Moody of Nostromo Research. “Land scarcity is a significant issue in this project,” said Jennifer Kalafut from the International Accountability Project. “The project would turn tens of thousands of farmers into landless wage laborers. GCM Resources has provided no meaningful analysis or plans on how to prevent the impoverishment of those who will be displaced.”Notes to Editor The GCM Resources plc AGM will be held at 10.00 a.m. on 16 December 2008 at the offices of Trowers & Hamlins LLP, Sceptre Court, 40 Tower Hill, London EC3N 4DX.

Paris, France ",New FoE report : French insurances : guaranteed climate change?,Crédit Mutuel ,France,,,,"
Friends of the Earth France today publish the report ""French insurances : guaranteed climate change?"" (1), the fist study on the 15 most important French insurance companies (2), which reveals that none of them has a complete climate policy. The asset management policies are the worst ones dealing with climate and energy issues. Asset management of French insurers generates induced emissions of 490 million tons of CO2, which is the equivalent of 90% of all French emissions. Public policies are also totally inadequate : none link climate, energy and asset management. Do climate-killer investments have a bright future?
The report ""French insurances : guaranteed climate change?"" is the result of eight months of research. It analyses the climate policies of the 15 main French insurance companies, on the basis of 10 criteria spanning in 3 main topics : global climate policy, insurance products and asset management.
The results of the report are crystal clear : no French insurer has a complete climate policy to this day. Sebastien Godinot, campaign coordinator at Friends of the Earth France, underlines that : ""The main problem is in asset management. French insurers manage the sum of 1500 billion euros (equivalent to 80% of French GDP). With explicit environmental and social criteria, this could be a useful leverage given the current economic crisis, to quickly direct the economy to low energy and natural resources models, creating local jobs. But the insurance companies asset management business model barely takes into account the climate : no targets, no shareholder activism, no reduction or exclusion policy of investments in the most polluting companies or of the false solutions (biofuels, nuclear, CCS...)"".
He continues : ""The emissions induced by the assets managed represent the equivalent to 90% of the total French emissions in 2006. Any insurer has the objective of reducing this huge impact, while the optimisation of investment portfolios can easily reduce their carbon intensity by 25%. As long as commitments do not translate in operational and verifiable objectives, it's only verbiage. The concrete work starts with the calculation of induced emissions, using the innovative methodology developed by Caisse d'Epargne, Centre Info and Utopies.""
Yann Louvel, Private Finance campaigner at Friends of the Earth France, adds : ""The government has its share of the responsibility : as long as investors do what they want regarding the climate and invest huge amounts without calculating the emissions they generate, as is the case today, the reduction of emissions to one quarter of present levels decided by the government by 2050 is non sense. We ask the French government and the European Union to work on objectives that the private financial sector will have to respect dealing with climate and energy in their financial activities, particularly in asset management. Putting pressure only on industry is simplistic and inefficient in an economy overcentered on financial activities"".
The study of Friends of the Earth France puts forward the best French and international practices and formulates four key recommendations to insurers :
- calculate their induced emissions and set reduction objectives ;
- develop an asset management policy integrating climate and energy explicit criteria ;
- develop more ambitious car and housing insurances : some interesting products already exist, but it's necessary to go even further ;
- put in place a transversal policy on climate. Current training on climate issues is extremely insufficient.

San Fransisco ",Bank of America stops funding Mountain Top Removal,Bank of America ,United States,Mountain top removal coal mining ,mining - coal ,United States,"
Rainforest Action Network praised Bank of America today for its decision to phase out financing for companies that practice mountaintop removal coal mining, a highly destructive and controversial method of coal extraction. The announcement, part of a new coal policy released on the bank’s website, reads: “We…will phase out financing of companies whose predominant method of extracting coal is through mountain top removal.”
“Bank of America’s decision is a giant leap forward in the fight against mountaintop removal coal mining, which has devastated Appalachian communities and the mountains and streams they depend on,” said Rebecca Tarbotton, director of Rainforest Action Network’s Global Finance Campaign, which has pressed Bank of America since October 2007 to cease financing of mountaintop removal mining and coal-fired power plants.
“We hope that Citi, JP Morgan Chase and other banks follow Bank of America’s lead.”
Bank of America’s policy comes the day after the Bush administration’s approval of a rule that will make it easier for coal companies to dump rock and dirt from mountaintop removal mining operations into nearby streams and valleys. The rule has been bitterly contested by environmentalists and Appalachian communities.
“This is a testament to the hard work of Appalachian communities and anti-coal activists across the country, whose collective pressure left Bank of America with little choice but to abandon its support for this barbaric form of resource extraction,” said Tarbotton. “To responsibly meet the challenges of the climate crisis, Bank of America’s next step should be a complete phase-out of coal financing and increased investments in energy efficiency and renewables.”
The bank’s policy also supports technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) and commits to promote the development and implementation of CCS to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Rainforest Action Network has argued that CCS is not yet close to being commercially viable and has pushed energy efficiency and renewable energy sources as far better investments.
Bank of America is currently involved with eight of the U.S.’s top mountaintop removal coal-mining operators, which collectively produce more than 250 million tons of coal each year. Mountaintop removal flattens mountain ranges and transforms healthy mountain woodlands into toxic sludge that has clogged more than 700 miles of rivers and streams. The practice is a major threat to the existence of many Appalachian communities. "

Amsterdam ",Waste of Money in Developing Countries,,,,,,"
The impact of the financial crisis on developing countries will be the subject of the second UN conference on Financing for Development, starting Saturday 29 November 2008 in Doha (Qatar). SOMO argues that tackling tax evasion and the ineffective promotion of foreign investment are important solutions for financing development.

 
Developing countries have been suffering from the financial crisis among others by less credit for production and trade activities or by more expensive credit for loans. The UN Conference on Financing for Development promotes foreign direct investment as a way to complement insufficient official development aid. However, the just published SOMO briefing ‘Promotion of Foreign Direct Investment: What Are the Costs?’ has found that the many instruments operated by donor-sponsored institutions to attract foreign direct investment, do not include a cost-benefit analysis nor guarantee a contribution to sustainable development.
 
“Attracting foreign direct investment without taking into account the economic, social, political and environmental costs in developing countries is only adding to the bill of the financial crisis, rather than finding solutions,” says Myriam Vander Stichele, one of the authors of the briefing.
 
In another research-based briefing, ‘Taxation and Financing for Development’, SOMO argues that tax revenues are an essential source of financing for development, which so far have been the subject of very little attention of the international development community.
“There are still many problems that undermine direct tax revenues in developing countries, such as tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance by multinational companies. The financial crisis and the attempts to introduce new regulations for the international financial system are providing an opportunity to tackle these problems,” says SOMO-researcher Maaike Kokke.

US and Netherlands ",China adopts sustainable lending laws,Bank of  ,China,Belinga iron ore project ,energy plants - dams | mining - non coal | transport and infrastructure,Gabon,"
(click here for the Chinese press release)
A new report released today by BankTrack analyzes green finance policies introduced in China over the past 18 months that are designed to curb the country's growing environmental problems, such as pollution and climate change. 
BankTrack, the international network that monitors commercial and investment banks, said that China's effort to improve the sustainability of its financial sector could provide regulators in other parts of the world with fresh ideas for how to approach the global financial crisis. The report, ""The Green Evolution: Environmental Policies and Practice in China's Banking Sector,"" comes on the heels of the recent ""BankTrack El Escorial Statement on Banks and the Financial Crisis,"" which stressed the need to create a more sustainable, robust and just financial system.
The report addresses recent regulations that seek to control bank lending to environmentally dubious projects and companies, and support more green projects.  In particular, the report applauds China's 'Green Credit Policy,' which has led to the inclusion of 38 firms on a ""credit blacklist"" due to environmental violations, and has resulted in at least RMB 2 billion (Euro 235 million) in loans being denied or recalled.  It also details China's new ""Green IPO"" (initial public offering) policy, which requires companies in polluting or energy-intensive industries to disclose environmental information and face a public comment period before stock is sold to the public.  Twenty out of 38 companies reviewed had their IPOs rejected or subjected to further assessment by the Environment Ministry since the policy's start in February 2008.
The report also found that some Chinese banks, particularly those that received government bailouts, have curtailed lending to polluting and energy-intensive industries.  For example, in 2007, Bank of Communications reported that it cut lending to the iron and steel industries by RMB 7.8 billion (Euro 916 million), and ICBC decreased loans to polluting industries by 24 percent.
""China's banking crisis led to massive government bailouts starting in the late '90s,"" said Michelle Chan of Friends of the Earth - US, one of the contributing authors to the report. ""But it wasn't ‘no-strings-attached.'  Banks had to make drastic changes, and new regulations forced banks to follow prudent lending practices, including taking the environment into account.  Governments around the world should demonstrate the same vision as they nationalize their banks and reform their financial sectors.""
Although China's green finance policies have recently led to positive changes, the report also points out some significant short-comings.
""Overall, Chinese banks still lag behind international best practice for environmental credit risk management systems, public reporting, and stakeholder engagement,"" said Adina Matisoff, China Sustainable Finance Coordinator for Friends of the Earth - US, and the report's lead author. ""Also, the scope of China's Green Credit Policy is limited, as the policy does not apply to Chinese banks' growing international lending portfolios.""
In addition, the report points out that China's green finance policies may be insufficient to counter contradictory national policies that have expanded the use of environmentally harmful energy sources including coal, large-scale hydropower, and nuclear power.
""In the midst of today's crisis, we have an opportunity to transform the banking sector into one that helps solve the pressing social and environmental problems the world is facing,"" said Johan Frijns, Coordinator of BankTrack. ""The new regulations in China are not perfect, but they offer some concrete examples of how financial regulations can advance environmental goals.""

US and Netherlands ",中国采纳可持续借贷法规,Bank of  ,China,Belinga iron ore project ,energy plants - dams | mining - non coal | transport and infrastructure,Gabon,"
 
美国和荷兰
- 银行监察组织今天发布的一份报告分析了过去18个月以来中国引入的绿色金融政策，该政策旨在遏制该国日益严重的污染和气候变化等环境问题。
银行监察组织是监察商业和投资银行的国际性网络。它认为中国改善金融业可持续性的努力可以为世界其他地方的监管者提供如何应对全球金融危机的新思路。
最近发布的《关于银行和金融危机的埃尔埃斯科里亚尔声明》，强调有必要建立一个更可持续、健全和公正的金融系统。这份题为《绿色变革：中国金融业的环境政策与实践》的报告接踵而至。
报告谈到最近中国制定了新法规，控制银行向存在可疑环境问题的项目和公司贷款，支持更多绿色项目。报告特别称赞了""绿色信贷政策""，该政策使38家公司由于环境违法而被列入""信贷黑名单""，导致至少20亿人民币（2，350万欧元）贷款被拒绝或收回。报告还详细介绍了新的""绿色上市（首次公开募股）""政策，该政策要求污染或能源密集企业披露环境信息并在公开募股前接受公众评议。自该政策于2008年2月开始执行以来，38家提出上市申请的公司当中有20家被环保部拒绝或被要求接受进一步审查。
报告发现一些中资银行，尤其是那些接受政府紧急财政援助的，缩减了对污染和能源密集行业的贷款。例如，2007年，交通银行报告称发放给钢铁行业的贷款减少了78亿人民币（9，160万欧元），中国工商银行发放给污染行业的贷款减少了24%。
""上世纪九十年代末以来，中国的金融危机导致了政府的大规模紧急财政援助，""本报告供稿作者之一，大地之友（美国）的Michelle
Chan说，""但并非‘不带附加条件'的。银行不得不做出重大改变。新法规迫使银行采取审慎的贷款方式，包括把环境因素纳入考量范围。世界各国政府在金融业的国有化和改革过程中应当显示出同样的远见。""
虽然中国的绿色金融政策最近引发了一些积极的变化，报告亦指出了该政策存在的一些重大缺陷。
 ""总体而言，中资银行在环境信贷风险管理系统、公开报告和利益相关者参与等方面仍然落后于国际最佳实践，""报告的主要作者，大地之友（美国）中国可持续金融项目协调员Adina
Matisoff说，""而且，中国的绿色信贷政策的覆盖范围还很有限，因为它不适用于中资银行日益增多的海外贷款组合。""
此外，报告指出中国的绿色金融政策可能不足以抗衡与之矛盾的扩大了煤、大型水电和核电等有害环境能源使用的国家政策。
""在当前的危机下，我们有机会促使银行业转型，以帮助解决世界面临的紧迫的社会和环境问题，""银行监察组织协调员Johan Frijns说，""中国的新法规并不完美，但它们为如何以金融法规推进环境目标提供了一些具体的示例。""

San fransisco ",Rainforest Action Network study ranks financed emissions of Canadian banks,Bank of Montreal (BMO) ,Canada,,,,"
Rainforest Action Network (RAN) released a new report and website today ranking the carbon footprints of Canada’s top banks: RBC, TD, Scotiabank, CIBC, BMO, Vancity and Desjardins. Financing Global Warming: Canadian Banks and Fossil Fuels is the first report to analyze and quantify the greenhouse gas emissions of Canadian banks based on their financing of the fossil fuel sector. The report also makes recommendations for what banks, bank customers, regulators and civil society can do to help reduce the climate impacts of banking. 


The report finds that 99 percent of each bank’s overall climate footprint comes from the fossil fuel production it finances. The “financed emissions” from Canada’s five largest banks totaled 625 million tonnes of CO2 in 2007, exceeding the total CO2 emissions in 2006 from all energy use across the country – including all power plants, industry and manufacturing, transportation, homes and offices – which totaled 583 million tonnes . 


 The report is based on a year of research by Profundo Research, and can be found at http://climatefriendlybanking.com/bankreport/.


 “When banks fund dirty energy projects like tar sands expansion or new coal-fired power plants, it locks in a polluting infrastructure that will cast a long carbon shadow over the country for decades to come,” said RAN’s Bill Barclay, lead author of Financing Global Warming. “Banks have a critical role to play in the move to a clean energy economy, and they can start by setting meaningful carbon reduction targets for their lending and investments.”


Of the top five banks, RBC has the largest absolute carbon footprint, having financed 198 million tonnes of fossil fuel-related CO2 emissions last year, and Scotiabank has the highest carbon intensity. In total, Canada’s five top banks provided more than $155 billion in national and international corporate financing for fossil fuel extraction in 2007, including substantial investments in the world’s largest and dirtiest fossil fuel development project: the expansion of Alberta’s tar sands. On average, fossil fuel extraction received 14 times more financing from Canada’s top banks in 2007 than clean energy projects.


By contrast, Desjardins and VanCity, two major banks based on the credit union model, have very low carbon footprints.


Based on the report’s results, RAN developed a free online Canadian bank carbon calculator that enables citizens to see the footprint of their personal deposit account and compare it to their potential footprint with other banking options. The calculator is available at www.climatefriendlybanking.com.


“Every dollar sunk into Tar Sands expansion is a dollar better invested in clean power and energy efficiency,” said Dr. Tony Clarke, founder and president of the Polaris Institute. “Canadians can play a critical role in stopping the Tar Sands development by pressuring their banks to shift their financing from fossil fuels to clean energy.”

 

Polls have shown that Canadians are seriously concerned about the climate and their personal ability to reduce energy use. RAN’s report shows that switching funds to a low-carbon bank is one of the easiest ways to significantly lessen one’s personal climate footprint. A $10,000 deposit account held in any of the top five high-carbon banks has a carbon footprint ranging from 970 to 1,430 kg larger than a deposit account held in Vancity, Canada’s lowest-carbon bank.

 

With more than $3.6 trillion in assets, the financing decisions of Canada’s top banks greatly impact Canada’s $1.3 trillion economy and the trajectory of the country’s future greenhouse gas emissions. In order to mitigate climate change, the report recommends that banks immediately adopt lending policies that address the impacts of climate change across all business lines.

Madrid, Spain ",BankTrack launches statement on Financial Crisis,,,,,,"
BankTrack today released ""Bank to the Future: El Escorial Statement on Banks and the Financial Crisis"" at a press conference in Madrid. The statement was drafted at BankTrack's annual strategy meeting, held in San Lorenzo de El Escorial earlier this week. It contains BankTracks´ current position on what is needed to deal with the unfolding financial crisis of today so that it will lead to a sustainable, robust and just financial system in the future.The statement recognizes that the world financial system is at the brink of collapse. It characterizes the current crisis as not only an economic and financial crisis, but one of governance and sustainability.It then streses the need for a ´New Green Deal´. Such a deal would not seek to stabilize the economic system as it is, but also aim to transform it into one that helps solve the pressing social and environmental problems the world is facing. The fiscal spending that is necessary to stimulate crisis-affected economies entering recession should be directed at achieving social justice, the promotion of sustainable production and consumption systems, and the transition of the world’s economies onto a low carbon path. The statement outlines a number of steps to deal with the crisis in each of these dimensions, including:

Eliminating the influence of banks in the political process 
Ensuring democratic participation in the design of a new global financial order
Putting a ""sustainable twist"" on international banking rules (such as including environmental and social risks into capital adequacy requirements)
Ensuring complete bank transparency regarding risk assessment processes and transactions
Eliminating the shadow banking sector by introducing regulations and reporting requirements
Prohibiting speculation in the derivatives markets, particularly those related to food and energy
Reducing incentives for excessive risk taking, such as eliminating short-term, volume-driven bonuses

The Statement concludes, ""We face a time of dramatic change that presents unique opportunities. Now that the once-dominant forces of market fundamentalism have been discredited, a new, equitable, and sustainable future can be built on the rubble of past excesses."" "

Amsterdam ",Financial institutions vote more in favour of climate,ABN AMRO ,Netherlands,,,,"
In 2008 Dutch banks and pension funds voted as shareholders more frequently in favour of climate resolutions than they did in previous years. Pension fund PGGM is in the lead while ING en Fortis rank lowest. These are the findings of the study “Aandelen in klimaatverandering""  (""Shares in climate change"") which Milieudefensie publishes today where the voting patterns of Dutch banks and pension funds on climate-related shareholder resolutions is scrutinized.PGGM in 2008 supported 90 per cent of the resolutions calling on companies to introduce climate policies and measures to reduce their CO2 footprint. In contrast, the ING branch in United States did not support a single climate resolution during the whole period. However, the European ING branch performs  better, it supported 62 per cent of the resolutions.  In the light of the urgency of the climate crisis financial institutions ought to support every single climate  resolution.”As major shareholders financial institutions can help reduce the carbon footprint of companies they finance”, says Willem Verhaak, head of the Climate Campaign at Milieudefensie. ""PGGM understood this, now it's time for the rest to follow their lead"" Milieudefensie calls on public authorities and regulators to use their current influence over financial institutions to stimulate them to deal more effectively with the climate crisis.
Milieudefensie examined the voting of equity funds of Rabobank, ING and Fortis and the three pension funds ABP, PGGM and PME. In addition to this study Milieudefensie also presents today a climate policy toolkit for banks: “A Practical Toolkit for Banks. Towards an Effective Climate Policy”.

United Kingdom ",Groups call for environmental regulation of RBS,Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS)  ,United Kingdom,,,,"
A coalition of NGOs, including Friends of the Earth Scotland and People & Planet, have today launched a call for the government to include environmental regulation as part of its multi-billion pound bail out of failing banks including the Royal Bank of Scotland.
RBS has been the subject of particular controversy in recent years due to its track record as the UK bank putting the most money into financing emissions intensive fossil fuel projects around the world.The groups are calling for the bail out terms to require full disclosure of the banks´ fossil fuel financing, as well as commitments to immediately cap and reduce the carbon emissions embedded in their investments and loans.Mel Evans, Climate and Finance campaigner at PLATFORM said, ""We need to ensure that we address long term climatic stability as well as stabilizing the economy. If banks like RBS continue to pump billions of pounds into coal and oil around the world, we are going to learn a hard lesson that nature doesn´t do bail outs.""Duncan McLaren, Chief Executive of Friends of the Earth Scotland said, ""We have seen what happens when financial risks are concealed from the market. The Government must seize this opportunity to ensure that carbon risks are handled transparently and accountably - otherwise we will be simply going from frying-pan to fire"".
Bronwen Smith-Thomas, head of campaigns at People & Planet said, ""It´s bad enough that people´s savings have been used by RBS to take us to the brink of climate catastrophe, now people´s taxes could be as well.The government needs to divert RBS´ financing away from fossil fuels and into climate change solutions.""

Berlin, Germany ",Ilisu Dam: Pullout officially initiated,,,Ilisu dam ,energy plants - dams,Turkey,"
Germany, Austria and Switzerland have started the official process of withdrawing financial support for the Ilisu project in Turkey. According to the German Under-Secretary of State, Erich Stather, from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, the three countries initiated exit proceedings yesterday by sending an Environmental Failure notice to the Turkish government. From now on, Turkey has 60 days left to fulfil the conditions attached to the Ilisu Project. Non-governmental organisations consider it unlikely that Turkey will fulfill these conditions, that they have been putting off for two years, in just two months.""The pullout could be completed by Saint Nicolas Day on the 6th December. Such a diplomatic step has not been taken ever before in the history of the European export economy"", said Ulrich Eichelmann from ECA Watch Austria. Heike Drillisch from the German Ilisu Campaign CounterCurrent comments: ""We welcome this long overdue decision from the three European governments. It is a great success for the Ilisu Dam Campaign. We will be watching very carefully to make sure that there are no underhand compromises made with Turkey at the last minute.""The start of the pullout process became necessary as independent experts reported time and time again that Turkey was not meeting its obligations and was ignoring international standards. In March 2007, the three countries had signed a contract with Turkey covering export credit guarantees to insure work on the Ilisu Dam project by ""their"" construction companies (Andritz AG, Zueblin AG, Alstom). Thereupon, Bank Austria, now UniCredit, the German Deka Bank and the French Société Générale agreed to provide loans of at least 450 million euros. This amount may not be available for the project anymore as, without governmental support, the banks are likely to also back out of the project. Contracts with the construction companies will then also be in doubt.""The Europeans' likely pullout is good news for the inhabitants of Hasankeyf and a motivation for us to step up our opposition to the project in Turkey itself. We have been given a real chance to save our home with its nature and cultural heritage that is thousands of years old,"" commented the Mayor of Hasankeyf, Abdulyahap Kusen.Worldwide opposition to the project has made ""Ilisu"" into one of the most controversial reservoir dam projects. A delegation from Hasankeyf including Mayor Kusen, the Turkish nature conservation organisation Doga Dernegi, and representatives of the German and Austrian Ilisu Campaign are currently in Berlin to campaign for the final pullout from the project.

Italy ",NGOs criticise private banks irresponsible investment in Kazakhstan,Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) ,Japan,Kashagan oil project ,oil and gas,Kazakhstan,"
Financial backers behind the Kashagan oil field in Kazakhstan have been called upon today to take action to resolve the environmental and health problems caused by offshore exploration at the 13 billion barrel project, located 20km off the northern Caspian Sea coast.


In a letter to BNP Paribas, the leading financier of the project, and other private banks involved   sixteen local and international environment organisations  are demanding that the institutions ensure an adequate and transparent plan for mitigating the project's environmental and social impacts is in place before any construction continues. The groups are also calling on the banks to make compliance with this plan a central and enforceable condition for any future financing of the Kashagan project, and to support for a complete independent scientific assessment of the social and environmental impacts of Kashagan’s development.


The organisations have raised concerns over environmental and public health dangers associated with Kashagan’s development and violations of international standards, including the Equator Principles, in the development of Kashagan’s offshore and onshore operations .


Galina Chernova, Director of the Atyrau based NGO “Center Globus” stated:

“The Kashagan oil field has been under development since 2002 and operations are expected to begin at the end of 2011. At present, the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) and associated Action Plans to comply with IFC Performance Standards and World Bank/IFC Pollution Prevention Abatement standards have not been disclosed by private financing institutions nor by the Agip KCO consortium, operating in the field. The EIA is not available in Kazakh, our national language and the only language that most of the communities directly impacted by the on shore facilities speak”.


Paul de Clerck of Friends of the Earth Europe stated:

“The Kashagan oil field is putting people and the planet at risk. Since offshore operations began in the Kashagan field ten years ago, local observers have registered alarming impacts on biodiversity. Species at risk include the endangered Caspian Seal and Beluga Sturgeon. In the event of an accident tens of thousands of people living in vicinity could be severely impacted and many people could be killed by toxic gas emissions. The banks should not finance the project as long as these problems are not solved.”


Elena Gerebizza of Campagna per la Riforma della Banca Mondiale (CRBM) stated:

“The credibility of private banks is at stake. They committed to implement the Equator Principles in the development of the Kashagan oil field and they should stick to their promise. Development operations should not continue until  environmental problems caused by offshore exploration and construction around the Kashagan field are solved. The preservation of the Caspian Sea, the largest reserve of fresh water in Central Asia, and of the fragile Northern Caspian ecosystem are at risk due to private banks irresponsible behaviour”.

 

Yann Louvel, FoE France:

The BNP Paribas 2006 CSR report stated, “The recent conclusions reported by the IGECC in Paris reinforce BNP Paribas’ commitment to combating climate change”. Developing Kashagan will lead to the consumption of about 513 million barrels of oil per year and to the production of 224 million tonnes of CO2 per year. The extraction of Kashagan oil will also cause emissions of ‘sour gas’ with one of the highest levels of H2S encountered in the offshore industry and to the production of about 110 kg of sulphur per tonne of extracted oil. Thus, financing Kashagan carries significant climate consequences and undermines the positive outcomes of any financing in the renewable energy sector.


Civil society organisations release today a short video clip on private banks investments in Kashagan, see the clip.
Notes:


 The private banks involved in financing Kashagan are BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Société Générale, Natixis, DZ Bank, HSH Nordbank, KfW, ING Bank, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizuho Bank, and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking.

Sofia, Bulgaria ",RWE's reputation on the line with 1.5 billion euro stake in Bulgarian nuclear plant,,,Belene nuclear power plant ,energy plants - nuclear,Bulgaria,"
Environmental campaigners have warned of the reputational risks in store for German energy giant RWE following the  announcement that it has been chosen as strategic  investor for the Belene nuclear power plant (NPP) in Bulgaria.  Belene NPP is situated in a zone of high seismic activity in the north of Bulgaria, close to the Romanian border. It is slated to become the first new build of a Russian design NPP within the European Union.Belene would be RWE's first investment into an NPP  outside Germany. The total project costs are estimated at EUR 7 billion.  For a 49 percent stake in the project, RWE has offered to provide EUR 1.275 billion in equity and a loan of around EUR 280 million Euro. Before the contract can be signed, however, RWE's supervisory board must give its approval.Heffa Schücking, of German environmental  organisation urgewald, said: ""For RWE there are many risks attached to this investment and one of them is the impact it will have on the company's reputation in Germany. The use of Russian reactor technology at the new Belene NPP and the siting of the plant in an earthquake zone have already provoked strong misgivings among municipal and union representatives on RWE's supervisory board. According to German standards, this project would never receive an operating license. We therefore call on RWE's supervisory board to say 'No' to this controversial investment.""Environmental organisations across Europe  consider Belene to be one of the most dangerous nuclear projects currently on the drawing board in Europe. In 1977, a large earthquake took place in the region and some 120 people died only 14 kilometres from the planned NPP site. Albena Simeonova, from the Bulgarian NGO  coalition BelenNE (No to Belene), said:""The plan to build a nuclear power plant in Belene goes back to the early 1980s. In 1983, however, even Soviet scientists warned that this location is not suitable for an NPP. RWE and the Bulgarian government are playing Russian roulette with the health and safety of millions of people.""Jan Haverkamp, Greenpeace campaigner for Eastern Europe, seconded these concerns: ""Up to now RWE has only operated NPPs in its home market. In Bulgaria, however, there is a poor safety culture and Bulgaria has repeatedly been warned by the EU because of corruption cases. Only a few weeksago, NEK, the majority shareholder in Belene,  announced that Bulgarian companies would be awarded contracts without a public tender. Such an environment opens the door to corruption and makes it difficult to guarantee high-quality safety standards.""One of the most prominent critics to have warned  RWE against the project is Dr. Georgui Kastchiev, the former head of the Bulgarian Nuclear Safety Authority.  According to Dr. Kastchiev: ""The Belene project poses intolerable safety and environmental risks. The lack of operational  experience with the planned reactor type and the lack of qualified personnel and effective controls will undoubtedly lead to a poor quality of construction works. If one factors in the high  seismic risks of the location and the low level of the nuclear safety culture in Bulgaria, it can only lead to one conclusion: this project must not go forward.""Heffa Schücking concluded: ""It will be interesting to see how NEK and RWE plan to raise the more than EUR 5 billion still needed to achieve financial closure for Belene. To date, more than a dozen banks have declined financing  and NGOs throughout Europe are determined to campaign against any financial institution that becomes involved with this project.""Notes for editors:1. While EUR 4 billion is often quoted as the  Belene NPP's total costs, this figure refers only to the contract with Atomstroyexport and does not include all construction costs such as turbines, infrastructure, project preparation, waste storage and the first fuel load. The estimated  total costs are EUR 7 billion as cited in:  ""Economic Minister pessimistic on Belene nuclear power plant funding"", Sofia Echo, 8.7.2008.2. Construction of the Belene nuclear power station started in 1985. The project was halted in 1991, and finally dropped in 1992 due to its environmental and economic risks. In 2003, however, the Bulgarian government restarted the project and in 2006 it decided to build two completely new reactors at the Belene site. The tender for construction was won by a consortium of the Russian firm Atomstroyexport and the French / German Areva NP to build an AES-92 nuclear power station with two VVER 1000/466B reactors. This is a first of a kind reactor that has no operational record elsewhere in the world.3. Dr. Gueorgui Kastchiev was one of the top managers of the Koszloduj nuclear power station from 1972 to 1989, and was head of the Bulgarian Nuclear Safety Authority from 1997 to 2001. He currently holds a position as Senior Nuclear Physicist at the Institute of Risk Research in Vienna. "

Washington DC ",New Friends of the Earth Ad Ties Nuclear Loan Guarantees to Bush Bailout,,,,,,"
Loan guarantees sought by nuclear industry for reactor construction amount to ‘preemptive bailout,’ with expected default rate of 50 percent or higherA new ad from Friends of the Earth accuses nuclear industry lobbyists of seeking a “preemptive bailout” from Congress in the form of risky, taxpayer-backed loan guarantees from Congress.“First the government bails out the banks, now all of Wall Street, at a cost of over 1 trillion dollars.  So why would taxpayers ever risk billions to build nuclear power plants?” the ad asks.  “With cheaper, safer alternatives, why is Congress even considering a preemptive bailout for nuclear power?”Nuclear industry executives admit that nuclear power is so financially risky that federal loan guarantees are the only way new plants will get built.  For example, Michael J. Wallace, the co-chief executive of UniStar Nuclear, told the New York Times last year that “without loan guarantees we will not build nuclear power plants.”  Unfortunately, the Congressional Research Service says such guarantees could leave taxpayers with “potentially large losses.”  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the risk of default on a nuclear loan guarantee is “very high—well above 50 percent.”“The fact that we’re already looking at a trillion-dollar bailout for the financial services industry ought to take an additional bailout for the nuclear industry off the table,” Friends of the Earth President Brent Blackwelder said.  “There are cleaner, safer, more affordable ways to address the energy crisis.  A multibillion-dollar preemptive bailout for the nuclear industry in the form of risky loan guarantees is not the answer.”Friends of the Earth is encouraging Americans who don’t want billions of their tax dollars to be spent bailing out the nuclear industry to join our campaign at http://www.foe.org.

Washington DC ",Friends of the Earth Opposes Bush’s Blank-Check Bailout,,,,,,"
  
      
Government response to
financial crisis must include fundamental structural reforms; Oversight,
re-regulation, and means of returning lost revenue to treasury are needed
Friends of the Earth
announced its opposition to the Bush administration’s proposed trillion-dollar
bailout of the financial system today, and called on elected officials to
ensure that any government action related to the financial crisis fixes deep
structural flaws in the financial system that have spawned not only the current
financial crisis but are also jeopardizing our planet’s future. 
Friends of the Earth
President Brent Blackwelder had the following statement: 
“This financial crisis
has exposed the right-wing’s anti-regulation philosophy as an abject failure.
Their hands-off approach to managing the economy has resulted in greedy
corporate titans getting rich on the backs of working people. This same
philosophy is causing irreparable harm to the planet. And now we face a
trillion-dollar taxpayer-funded bailout. Enough is enough.
“Friends of the Earth
opposes the Bush administration’s proposed blank-check bailout for these
wealthy financiers. What is needed is truly fundamental reform, not this
no-strings-attached proposal. The government must impose oversight and
re-regulation on the financial system. The days of the fox guarding the
henhouse, with corporate lobbyists writing the laws that regulate their
industries, must end. And we must consider environmental impacts to be economic
impacts as we move forward. While the risks posed to the economy by the current
financial crisis are indeed dire, we also face long-term risks posed by the
climate crisis. These problems are intertwined, and reforms of the financial
system must take this into account. 
“Reform must be
conducted in a just way that helps people on Main Street more than it helps corporate
fat cats on Wall Street. Taxpayer funds taken from the treasury to prop up Wall
Street must be replaced so they can be used to fund other necessary
initiatives.
“It’s ironic that when many
countries run into financial trouble, the International Monetary Fund imposes
serious economic restructuring, but President Bush and Secretary Paulson now
see no need for restructuring at all. They’re wrong, and their proposal should
be rejected."" 
This unprecedented
bailout not only imposes a hefty monetary cost on taxpayers and future
generations, but it represents enormous opportunity costs. In response, Friends
of the Earth is calling on Congress to consider the following specific reforms,
which adhere to the principles stated above: 
Any bailout package
should be just. 
- Financial
institutions should bear the brunt of the losses from this crisis; taxpayer
monies should be used to only cover the bare minimum to keep our banking system
functional.
- The government should
acquire an ownership stake in the institutions that are bailed out.
- Bailing out Wall
Street banks without making proportionate efforts to keep American families in
their homes is unfair. Friends of the Earth supports organizations such as the
Center for Responsible Lending, National Community Reinvestment Coalition and
the National Council on Civil Rights, who are advocating Chapter 13 judicial
modification relief to keep homeowners from losing their homes.
- In addition, failing
to hold executives accountable for the disastrous consequences of their actions
is unconscionable; those who were responsible should be persecuted to the full
extent of the law. In the future, fines and penalties for financial and
corporate malfeasance must be increased, and executive compensation must be
reigned in at all companies that are being bailed out.
Any bailout package
must be tied to a restoration of regulation and supervision of the financial
services industry. 
- Decades of deregulation
have allowed this industry to “innovate” new financial products, structures,
and vehicles at an astonishing rate without monitoring and supervision. Friends
of the Earth supports the call from Center for Economic and Policy Research to
require tradable instruments, such as credit default swaps, to be standardized
and traded on exchanges, which would subject them to regulation and
transparency.
- Now is the time to
ensure proper oversight over the financial services sector, and tighten up
rules on accounting and offshore tax havens which allow clever financial
engineering to hide real risks and liabilities. It is time to bring hedge funds
under supervision; and no hedge funds (which have refused to even register with
the SEC) should be bailed out.
- This is the time to
reinstate the Glass-Steagall Act, which regulated the banking and investment
industries after the Great Depression. The repeal of the act in 1999 paved the
way for massive overleveraging among financial institutions, increased the risk
of conflicts of interest, and put consumers real savings at risk.
Any bailout package
should include measures to cool down speculative hot money flows and asset
bubbles.
- The Fed should take
on a new role of proactively preventing asset bubbles, and take measures to
cool down overheating parts of the financial markets.
- As Friends of the
Earth has proposed since 1995, a Tobin-style tax (for example, 0.25 percent tax
on stock trading, and 0.02 percent tax on options, futures, swaps, and currency
trading) should be introduced to curb excessive speculation and promote
longer-term investing that serves the real economy. Tobin-style tax revenue
could be used to help pay for the bailout and address critical social and
environmental needs. 
Government-owned financial
institutions have the ability and responsibility to foster an environmentally
sound future.
- AIG, as it becomes a
federally controlled entity, should cease underwriting fossil fuel energy
projects and focus on facilitating a clean energy transformation. The same
principle should apply to other new federal entities that are created via this
bail out. The National Environmental Policy Act should apply to such entities.
- In the future, Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac should institute a policy to require an increasing
percentage of the mortgages they purchase to be “green” (location efficient,
energy efficient, and/or sustainably designed). It should phase out purchasing
mortgages for development in flood plains and coastal hazard zones.

London, Edinburgh ",Cashing in on Coal - New Report,Barclays ,United Kingdom,,,,"
The report compiles public evidence of coal industry financing by UK
banks in the last two years, and reveals that RBS has helped lend more
money to the coal industry, in more deals, than any other major UK bank.Published
by BankTrack, Stop Climate Chaos and PLATFORM, the report shows that
The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) has helped provide loans of almost $16
billion to coal-related companies over the last two years.Many
of the loans documented by the research have been made to companies
that are the subject of sustained controversy and criticism from
various quarters. Notably RBS, HSBC and Barclays were involved in loans
worth over $70 billion to the energy company E.ON over the course of
2007. E.ON plans to build the first new coal-fired power station in the
UK for 30 years at Kingsnorth in Kent.The report shows that
between May 2006 and April 2008, HSBC was involved three times in coal
loans, Barclays 17 times, while RBS participated in 27 different loans.
The total value of the loans that the banks were involved in was $38.24
billion for Barclays, $71.09 billion for HSBC, and $95.83 billion for
RBS.Most loans involve a consortium of banks, so these figures
do not represent the actual sums for which each bank is responsible.
Given the lack of public data as to the exact breakdown of each banks'
involvement, an estimated calculation can be made by dividing each loan
by the number of banks involved, and then attributing an equal slice of
the pie to each participant.Based on this process of
estimation, Barclays was responsible for an estimated $5.79 billion,
HSBC $10.10 billion and RBS $15.93 billion.Published by

San Francisco, USA ",Global civil society calls on private banks to withdraw support from Bangladesh coal mine,Credit Suisse ,Switzerland,Phulbari coal mine ,mining - coal ,Bangladesh,"
For immediate release


Over 100 civil society organizations from 31 countries are calling on financial backers to withdraw their support of the Phulbari coal project in Bangladesh, citing egregious human rights abuses and environmental concerns associated with the project. Today, a letter was sent on behalf of these organizations to major financial institutions including UBS, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley and FRM Corp./Fidelity Investments. 


Each of these financial institutions holds or manages shares in Global Coal Management Resources (GCM) which established a wholly owned subsidiary, Asia Energy Corporation, to develop the project.


“The Phulbari coal project is a disaster waiting to happen,” said Joanna Levitt from the International Accountability Project (IAP), a signatory to the letter and advocate for people uprooted and threatened by development projects and policies. “If implemented, the project could risk the impoverishment of tens of thousands of people—turning current farming households into landless wage-laborers who will be forced to compete for limited jobs, either in the agricultural sector or entirely different economic sectors.”


""The project is a deadly threat to food security, energy security and human security in Bangladesh,” said Anu Muhammad, Member Secretary of the National Committee to Protect Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources, Port and Power in Bangladesh and Economics Professor at Jahangirnagar University. “It will destroy fertile land, and desertification and dewatering will affect more than 256 sq km around the mine. About 75 percent of the coal from the mine will be exported from the country and it will uproot hundreds of thousands of people. The project will increase poverty and unemployment and will create a floating population of displaced people, including many children and women.""


The civil society letter cites many human rights abuses associated with the project including: the indiscriminate shooting of local residents opposing the mine; the arrest and torture of local leaders; non-compliance with the right of Indigenous Peoples to give their free, prior and informed consent to project; the threatened displacement of over 200,000 people; and massive environmental risks, including to the Sundarbans, a UNESCO protected mangrove forest.


“The financial institutions invested in GCM have a responsibility to withdraw their support from this project when human rights are being abused,” said Johan Frijns, Coordinator of BankTrack, another signatory to the letter. “To take no action is an indication in support of GCM and the Phulbari Coal Mine project.”


Enclosed with the letter to the banks was the final draft of a forthcoming reportfrom IAP and Bank Information Center (BIC) which critically examines the potential social impacts the coal mine would have on the local population. 


The report, An Assessment of the Draft Resettlement Plan Prepared by Global Coal Management/Asia Energy Corporation, concludes that that over 200,000 Bangladeshis will be impacted by the project, many of whom will be forcibly relocated, losing vitally important farm land and access to economic livelihood. As land scarcity is already a major issue in Bangladesh, this forced displacement will also likely lead to increased conflict in the project area.

Sao Paulo ",Environmentalists Blast Construction License for Amazon Dam,Banco Bradesco ,Brazil,Rio Madeira dams: Jirau and Santo Antonio ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"
Environmental organizations have condemned the Brazilian government´s
approval of a license for construction of Santo Antonio Dam, on the
Madeira River in the Brazilian Amazon. The groups say that Brazil´s
environmental protection service, Ibama, has caved in to political
interests, ignoring the advice of its own technical staff in licensing
the dam, and approving a mitigation plan which will do little to
decrease its impacts.  Santo Antonio Dam would be the first of two dams to be built on the
Madeira, the Amazon´s principal tributary. Environmental impact
assessments predict serious impacts on the region´s biodiversity, and
on river bank communities, including indigenous tribes living close to
the reservoir area.  Glenn Switkes, of International Rivers, says ""Environment Minister
Carlos Minc´s decision to license the dam demonstrates his mandate is
to accelerate the building of large-scale, high-impact projects in the
heart of Amazonia. The fact that construction will be permitted without
a definitive solution in place for fish passage threatens the
livelihoods of thousands of river bank dwellers who depend on
high-value fish species for their income"".  Ibama required the consortium building the dam to submit an impact
mitigation plan to demonstrate how they would comply with 33 conditions
that the agency placed on the project. But independent analyses show
that the mitigation plans include vague promises that are restricted to
monitoring and further studies, rather than concrete measures to reduce
the project's impacts. Decisions regarding the project´s social and
environmental viability, which should have been analyzed during the
preliminary licensing phase, in July 2007, have been in effect deferred
until later, when it will be too late to avoid the project´s most
serious effects.  Despite the fact that the construction license was issued only today,
communities living close to the planned worksite have already been
pressured to leave their homes, and accept inadequate compensation
terms.   Iremar Ferreira, Executive Director of the Living Madeira Institute in
Porto Velho says ""This is a serious violation of the human rights of
the displaced people. The only assistance they are being given is a
small payment for their land. As a result, they will have to find a way
to survive on abandoned cattle ranches, miles from the banks of the
Madeira where their families have lived for generations.   Friends of the Earth, Brazilian Amazon says the granting of the
construction license under these conditions will mean additional
challenges to the project in the courts, and predicts further project
delays, meaning added risks for investors and financiers of the project.  Gustavo Pimentel of Friends of the Earth says ""The project violates the
Equator Principles (on project finance), and therefore should not be
financed by banks such as Bradesco, Banco do Brasil, Itaú, and Unibanco
that have committed to the principles. Brazilian banks have an
opportunity to prove that they are truly committed to sustainability by
refusing to finance the destruction of the Amazon"".  -30- "

Beijing, China ",Paper Tigers: APP's polluting China arm seeks IPO,,,,,,"
Greenpeace China and local green
groups are lobbying the Chinese government to reject Gold East Paper's
application for a domestic stock listing because of its shocking
environmental record.Gold East Paper is an affiliate of
Indonesian logging giant APP, which is suspected of illegal forest
destruction in Indonesia and China.Greenpeace recommends that
China's Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) carefully consider
whether this company, which violates pollution laws and illegally
destroys forests, should have the right to raise capital by listing its
shares on the Shanghai stock market.Gold East Paper has
submitted its initial public offering (IPO) application to the China
Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), the regulatory body of China
stock market.  Following an agreement between CSRC and MEP on new
listing applications, the MEP initiated a 10-day consultation period
from Aug 5 to 14 to gather the public's opinion about the Gold East
Paper. (More details of this green finance initiative can be found here) Investigations
by Greenpeace China and fellow green groups, including Global Village,
Friends of Nature, Green SOS and Green Watershed have found that since
August 2005, Gold East Paper and its seven subsidiaries in China have
been guilty of eight serious environmental offenses.These include:

On June 10, 2008, Suzhou City Environmental Protection
Bureau found that Gold Hua Sheng Paper had exceeded legal pollution
limits.

 

And on July 4, 2008, Hainan Jinhai Pulp and Paper was found guilty of discharging illegal black effluent.

 

Gold East Paper's subsidiaries operating in Yunnan and
Hainan provinces are also suspected of illegal logging and inflicting
serious damage to nature reserves.

 

In 2007, Greenpeace China discovered that Hainan Jinhai
Pulp and Paper had been illegally clearing forest for eucalyptus
plantations.

China's environmental ministry first has to approve the listing before it goes to the securities regulator.During
the ministry 10-day public consultation on the company IPO (from August
5 to 14), Greenpeace and many local green groups have been urging the
watchdog to pay attention to the enterprise's environmental
shortcomings when considering whether to approve the listing.It
is clear that APP, Gold East Paper, and its subsidiaries have shown a
complete lack of sincerity in keeping their environmental promises.Until
these issues are resolved, Greenpeace China recommends that Gold East
Paper not be allowed to proceed with a domestic listing. "

Washington ",Banks Lack Robust Framework for Minimizing Social Risks,,,,,,"
A new study finds that international project financiers, including the leading international banks and the International Finance Corporation, do not have a robust framework for minimizing the social risks posed by their projects.  The study—The International Finance Corporation’s Performance Standards and the Equator Principles: Respecting Human Rights and Remedying Violations?—notes that recently-adopted standards are not likely to reduce potential human rights-related conflicts that may arise in projects.  The Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL) and the Bank Information Center (BIC), with support from World Resources Institute, Oxfam Australia and BankTrack, used the Danish Institute for Human Rights’ Human Rights Compliance Assessment tool to analyze the extent to which the International Finance Corporation’s (IFC) Performance Standards address human rights concerns.    The analysis reveals that the IFC Performance Standards and Equator Principles fail to address most critical human rights adequately and fail, even, to ensure that human rights concerns are assessed.      The IFC is the private sector financing arm of the World Bank Group, and is widely viewed as the leader among international project financiers for its environmental and social risk management standards. The “Equator Principle” financial institutions, which represent over 70 percent of project finance in emerging markets, have committed to apply the IFC’s standards. In 2007, US$52.9 billion of project finance debt in emerging market economies was subject to the Equator Principles.   In addition, the export credit agencies (ECAs) of the members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development have agreed to adopt the IFC’s standards as a common environmental and social benchmark for export credits and loan guarantees.  To assess the relevance of human rights to project finance, the study reviewed 60 projects that generated complaints from locally-affected communities, and determined that these projects implicated most of the internationally recognized human rights.  Among the rights most often implicated were the right to food, right to property, right to life, and right to health.   The groups submitted this study to the United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, Professor John Ruggie, requesting his attention to this issue.  Daniel Magraw, President of the Center for International Environmental Law, notes that, in a June 2008 report to the Human Rights Council, Special Representative Ruggie indicated that companies have a “baseline responsibility” to respect all internationally recognized human rights.  Steve Herz, an author of the current study, stated, “The Performance Standards and Equator Principles must be significantly amended if they are to provide project sponsors with appropriate guidance for meeting their human rights responsibilities and minimizing human rights-related risks.”

London ",Unconventional oil could cost us the earth,,,Canadian tar sands ,oil and gas,Canada,"
With oil prices soaring, investing in unconventional fuel sources – such as oil sands or oil shale – could appear to be an attractive option, but according to a new report released on Tuesday by WWF and the Co-operative Financial Services (CFS), such investments are both environmentally and economically unsustainable and can only serve to undermine international efforts to combat climate change. Extracted from tar-soaked shale or sand, unconventional oil is an energy and resource intensive product, creating up to eight times as many emissions as conventional oil production does, while also using three barrels of water to produce just one barrel of oil and destroying large tracts of arboreal forests in the process. Scientists have predicted that, if fully exploited, the emissions from these oil sources could accelerate climate change to levels that would threaten a mass species extinction. ""Unconventional fuel sources may seem attractive in the short term but ultimately the environmental and economic costs are unthinkable,"" says James Leaton, Senior Policy Officer at WWF-UK. ""In addition to the rising cost to consumers and businesses from high oil prices, the environment is paying at both a local and global level. The solution is to develop alternatives, such as renewable energy, rather than continue to indulge our addiction to oil."" More than US$125 billion of unconventional oil projects have been announced for development by 2015. High energy, labour and material costs mean that developing an oil sands project is up to 20 times as capital intensive as conventional oil projects. In addition to investing heavily in the development of US oil shales, Shell has announced an intention to produce 670,000 barrels of oil daily from Canadian oil sand by 2020, while ExxonMobil and BP are also both hoping to produce several hundred thousand barrels each per day. ""The current rush to invest in unconventional fossil fuels is wholly inappropriate and due to their carbon intensity, these projects risk dangerous levels of climate change,"" says Paul Monaghan, Head of Social Goals and Sustainability at The Co-operative. ""Our long-term future and economic stability depends on the development of a low carbon economy within our lifetimes. We intend to use this report as the basis of our shareholder engagement with oil companies, and will be working with our 6.5 million customers to ensure that the UK and the EU have a robust legislative framework in place that will prevent these climate hostile fuels from entering the domestic market."" WWF and CFS are calling for a global halt to the licensing of new unconventional oil and for strong legislation, similar to the Emissions Standard currently in force in California, to be introduced in North America and Europe, prohibiting the sale of fuels with higher emissions than traditional oil. Because the lifecycle emissions of oil sands and oil shale are higher than those produced by conventional oil extraction, if this standard were replicated elsewhere, it would effectively outlaw unconventional oil products. ""Companies and investors claim to recognise the need to tackle climate change and support international efforts such as Kyoto. In oil sands we have an activity that is going against this imperative and undermining Canada's Kyoto commitments, so it is time for investors to challenge this strategy."" James Leaton continues. ""Technologies which could potentially mitigate the environmental impacts of these proas carbon capture and storage (CCS), are still too far away from being a viable solution on a large scale. The scope for development of CCS must not lock us in to a carbon intensive future, when it is clear that the developed world needs to start cutting emissions now."" Ian Jones, Head of Responsible Investment at The Co-operative Investments added: ""We intend to use this report as the basis of our shareholder engagement with oil companies to try to persuade them to take a more progressive path."" ""The extraordinary lengths some oil and gas companies go to in attempting to make these climate-hostile fuels somewhat less so should be re-directed to bringing forward low-carbon energy. Most oil companies have hardly begun to factor in the externalities that are currently imposed on the environment, yet are rapidly expanding unconventional oil developments in the hope of future technological solutions, subsidies, and favourable government intervention. Shareholders should challenge those oil companies that fail to steward investment responsibly.""

Shanghai, China ",Eight Chinese NGOs Announce Green Banking Innovation Award,Industrial Bank ,China,,,,"
On behalf of eight Chinese environmental NGOs, Mr. Yu Xiaogang, Director of Green Watershed, announced the Green Banking Innovation Award in  on July 26th. China Industrial Bank Co. Ltd. received this award at the Best China Banks Ceremony organized by the Economic Observer weekly in Shanghai. The Green Banking Innovation Award is the first-ever award in China specifically about green banking and sustainable finance, which will promote banks and other financial institutions to consider their roles in environmental protection. This award was nominated and voted by eight renowned NGOs: Green Watershed, Friend of Nature, Institute of Public & Environmental Affairs, Green Earth Volunteer, Global Environmental Institute, Civil Society Watch, China Development Brief and Green Volunteer League of Chongqing. SynTao Co. Ltd., a leading consulting firm in  on corporate social responsibility, acted as an advisor to this award. In his speech, Mr. Yu Xiaogang explained: “Green Banking is defined from two dimensions. Internally, a green bank often improves resource efficiency and encourages employees to participate in environmental activities. Externally and more importantly, it has to minimize indirect environmental impacts through financing activities, and explores new opportunities from environment-related business.” According to this definition, the jury committee, consisting of eight NGOs, developed an approach to assess the overall performance of nominated banks based on materials submitted by banks as well as public information. China Industrial Bank got the highest score and won this award. This is a bank that promises to integrate social responsibility and sustainable development into its strategy, and has implemented numbers of activities. For instance, environmental performance has become a precondition for its business loans, and the bank will withdraw the money if any environmental violation is discovered. China Industrial Bank also collaborates with IFC on energy efficiency lending project that supports companies to improve energy efficiency and control carbon emission. With this, the bank was awarded by Financial Times in 2007 as runner up in “the Sustainable Deal of the Year”. In addition to that, China Industrial Bank is a member of UNEP FI and a signatory of CDP 6, and recently announced to adopt the Equator Principle. It is a brand new experience for grassroots in  to award a bank. This not only indicates Chinese NGOs are using more diversified approaches to advocate sustainable development, but highlights the efforts of Chinese banking sector on environment. Mr. Yu Xiaogang pointed out at the end of his speech, “This is a first but important try. To the winner, this award means both honors and responsibilities. We expect China Industrial Bank can continue its innovation and build up a model green bank in China.” Organizers said they would continue to nominate and note Chinese green bank next year.

San Francisco, US ",Environmental Groups Urge Exxon Executive to Re-route Sakhalin I Oil Pipeline,,,Sakhalin II oil and gas project ,oil and gas,Russian Federation,"
Twelve US, Russian and international environmental
organizations sent a letter today to Exxon Chief Executive Rex
Tillerson urging the company to re-route a proposed pipeline away from
herding grounds vital for indigenous people and around a bay that is
vital for a critically endangered whale population in Russia (see copy
of letter below). If the pipeline is built according to current plans,
two indigenous groups' livelihoods will be severely harmed and the
Western Gray Whale will be further threatened with extinction,
according to the groups and several independent reviews.  In Phase Two of the Sakhalin I pipeline, Exxon proposes
to build an oil pipeline across the enormous Piltun Lagoon, which
provides vital sustenance for the critically endangered Western Gray
Whale.  The Western Gray Whale Advisory Panel and two Public Expert
Environmental Reviews have expressed strong concerns about the
pipeline's impacts on the whales and have urged that the pipeline be
rerouted around Piltun Lagoon.  The expert Western Gray Whale Advisory
Panel stated:  ""Given the precarious state of the western gray whale
population, a precautionary approach is essential. We suggest that it
would be preferable to develop an alternative option, such as rerouting
of the pipeline, to eliminate the potential for disruption of key
processes of biological productivity within the Lagoon.""  Environmental organizations point to additional expert
reviews that concur with the international Western Gray Whale Advisory
Panel:  ""In addition to the Western Gray Whale Advisory Panel,
two additional reviews by independent Russian experts have recommended
that Exxon show some precaution and re-route the proposed pipeline
around Piltun Lagoon,"" said Aleksey Knizhnikov, Oil & Gas
Environmental Policy Officer, WWF Russia.  The environmental groups' letter to Exxon's Tillerson
also challenges a proposal to build an ice dam across Piltun Lagoon to
facilitate pipeline construction.  According to the letter:  ...roject plans put the fish reserves and entire
living ecosystem of Piltun Bay at great risk because the proposed ice
bridge, which will act as a dam, will interrupt the natural water
exchange between the Sea of Okhotsk and the large, northern part of the
bay during the winter and spring of 2008-2009. Close to 2/3 of the bay
will be artificially isolated from sea water for several months, until
the summer sun finally melts the ice dam.    The
environmental groups' letter also urges Tillerson to re-route the
proposed pipeline away from areas used by subsistence indigenous
reindeer herders.  According to the letter:   is intended to cross the most
important summer reindeer pastures and calving grounds on the island,
which have been traditionally used, and are used to this day by a
community of herders including both native Uilta and Evenki peoples. 
You should be aware that the infrastructure previously built by Exxon
on Chaivo Bay has already done enormous damage to the reindeer pastures
and calving grounds, and from 2001 to 2006 the domestic reindeer herd
shrank by approximately 40% due to a rising number of miscarriages and
a falling birth rate. If the planned Piltun pipeline is built through
the summer reindeer pastures and calving grounds, the reindeer herds
will potentially be decimated, and the Uilta and Evenki peoples risk
losing both their livelihoods and their traditional way of life.  The environmental groups are challenging Exxon
to change the pipeline route to avoid these impacts and in so doing
decrease political risks associated with the project:  ""Around the world Exxon is being challenged to be more
responsive to environmental concerns.  Sakhalin I is an example of a
project where Exxon can reduce project impacts while lowering project
risks in this politically unstable environment,"" said Doug Norlen,
Policy Director, Pacific Environment.  The proposed Sakhalin I pipeline, on Sakhalin Island in
the Russian Far East, is proposed by Exxon Neftegas Ltd., a project
operating company managed by Exxon.  -30-
     The Western Gray Whale
Advisory Panel includes world-class scientific experts specializing in
whales and marine conservation,  The panel was established by the
International Union for the Conservation of Nature to review the
impacts of oil and gas projects in the Sakhalin area on the critically
endangered Western Gray Whale.  Since the WGWAP's creation, the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Export Credit
Agencies of the US and UK have withdrawn from consideration billions of
dollars in potential financing for the nearby Sakhalin II project.
Among scientists, the WGWAP continues to be viewed as a kind of
‘supreme court' of scientific review of the health of, and impacts to
the Western Gray Whale. "

Edinburgh, London ",UK groups slam RBS for fossil fuel financing on the eve of its CSR report launch,Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS)  ,United Kingdom,,,,"
On Friday July 4, the Royal Bank of Scotland will launch its 2007 Corporate Responsibility (CSR) Report. A coalition of environmental NGOs, including Friends of the Earth Scotland and People & Planet , are casting doubt on the bank’s green credentials in light of its ongoing role in financing fossil fuel expansion around the world. In 2007 RBS supported the fossil fuel industry with over $6 billion, while the bank’s embedded missions passed 50 million tonnes of CO2 – more than Scotland .  The groups expect that the report will focus on the bank’s lending of $2-4 billion to renewables projects in order to bolster its environmental credibility, while largely ignoring the impacts of the greater continued support of over $6 billion for - often heavily contested - fossil fuel projects . The emissions embedded in the bank’s fossil fuel lending portfolio have continued to rise, passing 50 million tonnes of CO2 in 2007 – greater than Scotland's emissions, and more than 100 times the bank's internal emissions.   The Bank has consistently claimed it should not be held responsible for the emissions resulting from fossil fuel projects, yet implicitly claims the credit for emissions reductions resulting from renewable energy. In last year's report RBS gave the false impression that the bank's support for renewable energy was as great as its support for  fossil fuels, by excluding much of the financing provided or arranged for firms involved in fossil fuels.  It remains impossible to identify the full extent and implications of the Bank's fossil fuel investments from any public documentation, not just the CSR report.  There are also serious concerns about the human rights impacts of some of RBS' investment portfolio. RBS indirectly finances Chinese state oil company Sinopec, which plays a key role in propping up the Burmese junta. Less than two months previously, during the brutal crackdown on the monks' protests, Sinopec began drilling an onshore well in a joint venture with the Burmese regime’s Myanmar Oil & Gas Enterprise.   RBS has publicly recognised the need for there to be a transition to a low carbon economy, and is keen to portray itself as being a key player in this transition through sponsorship of events such as last week’s Low Carbon Economy Summit in London. Environmental campaigners say that if RBS is to be taken seriously as a ‘green’ bank, it must become fully transparent regarding the implications of the finance it provides and arranges, properly consider the risks arising from such investments, and therefore cap and reduce its lending to coal, gas and oil projects and companies.  Duncan McLaren, Chief Executive of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said:  ""We welcome the activity of RBS in financing renewable energy, but it cannot claim environmental credit for supporting clean energy capacity while simultaneously failing to disclose and denying responsibility for the enormous amount of carbon emissions resulting from its financial support for fossil fuels. It's time the Bank came clean about the details of its lending portfolio, so we can have an informed debate.”  James Lloyd, Head of Campaigns at People & Planet, said:  ""In the last year and a half, RBS has made small steps in the right direction. For example, taking down its oilandgasbank.com website, ending its climate change denial and capping its internal emissions. It now needs to put its money where its mouth is and stop pouring cash into a new wave of fossil fuel projects that will emit millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide for decades to come.”  Kevin Smith, Climate Change and Finance Campaigner at Platform, said:  ""If Tom McKillop is serious about the need for a low carbon economy, the most practical move he could make would be to stop lending money to new oil pipelines and coal mines. Investing in renewables needs to happen instead of fossil fuel financing rather than alongside it.”  Karen Grant, from Scottish Education and Action for Development, said:  ""Corporate Social Responsibility should involve careful consideration of an investment’s impacts on human rights as well as the environment. RBS’ involvement in activities in human rights hotspots such as Burma, West Papua and Sudan is undermining its commitment to being a good corporate citizen.""

Following its commitments of last year, the Caisse d'Epargne published their labeling methodology to inform consumers with respect to the banks' management of issues related to security, responsibility and climate.


Friends of the Earth France accepted Caisses d'Epargne's invitation to participate in the development of the climate methodology, which is currently a very innovative initiative compared with other financiers. The most difficult part still has to be done, however: to incite consumers to use this methodology, to train bankers to integrate it in their day-to-day practices and, most of all, to generalize it to all the banking sector. Friends of the Earth France will monitor these developments carefully.


In 2005, the first FoE France analysis on the environmental practices of French banks highlighted the ""backlog of the squirrel"" (Caisse d'Epargne's logo). In 2006, the institution seemed to wake up, a fact which was confirmed in 2007. By 2008, Caisse d'Epargne went even further: its labeling methodology, which has been made fully public, has made it a very innovative bank in terms of consumer information.


Yann Louvel, private finance campaigner at Friends of the Earth France, explains : ""Most of the banks only work on their direct GHG emissions. But our calculations, confirmed by several banks, clearly show that these emissions only count for 0,1% of the induced emissions by banks' financing and investment activities. The conclusion is clear: we must give priority to developing environmental policies governing banks' financing activities, particularly with respect to climate change. And these policies need to start with developing a GHG reporting methodology.""


The Caisse d'Epargne climate methodology focuses on calculating CO2 emissions of its retail products and services, including the emissions generated by financed companies, and also the emissions generated by the products made by these companies. Sébastien Godinot, campaigns coordinator at Friends of the Earth France, adds : ""By working with the Swiss consultant Centre Info, the Caisse d'Epargne chose to calculate the GHG emissions covering Scope 1 (direct emissions), 2 (indirect emissions), and 3 (upstream and downstream emissions, including the use of the product) of the GHG Protocol, the international reference for GHG accounting. This is very positive since the large majority of companies limit themselves to levels 1 and 2.""


For instance, car producers generally publish the emissions linked to the production of the cars, but not to the use of the cars, which actually represent 88% of the total lifecycle emissions.


The approach, however, is far from perfect. Friends of the Earth France raised 5 main points to Caisse d'Epargne for the future:

 


The use of the labeling will largely depend on the training bankers will get in the local branches. This implies a massive training program in the next two years;


Its use will also depend on the sensitization of consumers, so that they can understand it and use it, similar to the energy labeling system for other appliances which is now commonly used.


Its effectiveness will also depend on how the Caisse d'Epargne uses the methodology to inform the development of its own financial products and services. The labeling initiative currently informs bank customers, but it has not yet modified the bank's business model;


Considering its very innovative aspect, the methodology will need to be deepened and consolidated in some respects;


Most of all, the methodology today applies to the retail bank, but not to the bank's two other major business units, corporate investment banking and asset management. Since these activities generate most of the bank's induced emissions, Caisse d'Epargne have commited to go this way: this is fundamental.



Sébastien Godinot, campaigns coordinator at Friends of the Earth France, concludes : ""The effort made by Caisse d'Epargne clearly demonstrates the huge potential for progress. The other French banks should be inspired and question their own practices, instead of participating in nuclear power plants in seismic zones, like BNP Paribas is doing in Bulgaria. We're convinced that, in the end, this labeling will become mandatory, because it answers growing demands from citizens on companies' transparency, and it follows one commitment of the Grenelle de l'Environnement (major French official meeting on the environment with NGOs, state, localities and unions that happened last autumn in France). All banks must then adopt the labeling methodology"".

Tokyo, San Fransisco, Moscow, Nijmegen ",Environmental groups condemn Japanese and French banks for financing Sakhalin II oil and gas project in Russia,BNP Paribas ,France,Sakhalin II oil and gas project ,oil and gas,Russian Federation,"
Environmental organizations today condemned the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and four private banks’ June 16 decision to provide approximately 5.3 billion dollars in financing for the problematic Sakhalin II oil and gas project in the Russian Far East.  JBIC (the Japan government’s official export credit agency), Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (Japan), Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd (Japan), Sumitomo Mitsui Bank Corp (Japan) and BNP Paribas (France) have severely violated their environmental policies by financing Sakhalin II, according to the groups.  ""We are indignant that JBIC and the other Japanese and French banks financed Sakhalin II.  We stand in solidarity with Russian and international environmental organizations in condemning our government bank’s decision to finance a project that so severely violates their environmental standards.” said Naomi Kanzaki, Development Finance and Environment Program Director, Friends of the Earth, Japan.The Japanese and French banks’ decision to finance Sakhalin II comes despite severe violations of these banks’ environmental and social policies that have been documented over several years by a diverse array of professional experts appointed by Sakhalin Energy, public and private banks, international and Russian scientific institutions, and Russian government authorities.  On June 11, 2008, seventeen environmental groups sent the banks involved a fourteen-page letter citing a litany of these examples of violations.  “The broad range of experts that have documented environmental damage and policy violations represent a growing consensus that Sakhalin II is an environmental and social failure,” said Dmitry Lisitsyn, Chairman of the Sakhalin Island-based Sakhalin Environment Watch.     The environmental groups’ letter was accompanied by a graphic photo report of a fact finding mission completed in early June. The environmental groups stress that financing by JBIC and other banks for Sakhalin II conflicts with decisions against financing by the broader international banking community:“Sakhalin II never achieved environmental clearances from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, UK Export Credit Guarantee Department and the US Export-Import Bank.  The project’s fundamental environmental and social shortcomings contributed to the ultimate unwillingness of these public banks to finance the project.” (from the June 11 letter)  “These five banks have severely compromised the larger international banking community’s efforts to maintain minimal environmental and social policies of public and private banks world-wide,” said Doug Norlen, Policy Director, Pacific Environment.  “It is decisions like these that contribute to a deep cynicism about sustainable banking.  If threatening an endangered whale population with extinction is considered responsible banking, then one starts to wonder what reckless banking looks like,” said Johan Frijns, Coordinator of BankTrack, the NGO network on private bank reform.“This is tragic news for the environmental and social credibility of JBIC and the private banks involved.  But its even worse news for Sakhalin’s environment and impacted communities that are victimized by these banks’ decision,” said Kanzaki.   Notes:   Sakhalin II is operated by Sakhalin Energy Investment Company, Ltd, which is comprised of Gazprom, Royal Dutch Shell, Mitsubishi and Mitsui.     . "

Tokyo ",Japanese Banks Blasted for Investment Plans in Sakhalin II,BNP Paribas ,France,Sakhalin II oil and gas project ,oil and gas,Russian Federation,"
Eighteen environmental organizations today sent a letter assailing the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and four commercial banks’ reported plan to provide approximately 5.3 billion dollars in financing for the problematic Sakhalin II oil and gas project in the Russian Far East. The groups are asking JBIC, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. and French BNP Paribas to refuse all funding to the Sakhalin II project. According to the letter, Sakhalin II’s environmental damage violates the banks' funding requirements and should be deemed ineligible for loans.   “Sakhalin II has consistently committed severe violations of JBIC and commercial bank environmental and social policies. Financing of Sakhalin II will damage these bank’s environmental credibility and expose them to increased reputational and financial risks,” said Eri Watanabe, FoE Japan.  The environmental groups’ fourteen-page letter cites a litany of examples of violations of bank policies, internationally accepted practice and Russian law that have been documented over several years by a diverse array of professional experts appointed by Sakhalin Energy, public and private banks, international and Russian scientific institutions, and Russian government authorities.  “The broad range of experts that have documented environmental damage and policy violations represents a growing consensus that Sakhalin II is an environmental and social failure,” said Dmitry Lisitsyn, Chairman of the Sakhalin Island-based Sakhalin Environment Watch.   The environmental groups’ letter also stresses that financing by JBIC and the commercial banks consortium for Sakhalin II will be in conflict with decisions against financing by the international banking community:  “Sakhalin II never achieved environmental clearances from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, UK Export Credit Guarantee Department and the US Export-Import Bank. The project’s fundamental environmental and social shortcomings contributed to the ultimate unwillingness of these public banks to finance the project.”(from the letter)   Reportedly, JBIC, the Japanese government’s export credit agency, will lead the  syndicate of banks which is to provide financing for Sakhalin II this month.  “Financing under such conditions undercuts the international banking community’s efforts to maintain minimal environmental and social policies of public and private banks world-wide,” said Doug Norlen, Policy Director, Pacific Environment.   The letter also presents the results of environmental groups’ fact-finding mission on the pipeline route that they conducted in early June 2008.  “The extensive and ongoing environmental damage that we documented is the result of poor project design and implementation that has also led to over a year’s delay in the completion of the project,” said Lisitsyn.  “Commercial banks should stay out of the project. The fact that multilateral financial institutions and export credit agencies have decided to steer clear of the Sakhalin II project ought to send a signal of warning to private banks: Pursuing this project involves a multitude of complex risks and threats that could do serious damage the banks’ public image, especially in the light of the wide media exposure of mismanagement in Sakhalin II,” said Jeni Tasheva, Campaigner for BankTrack.   Notes:  Sakhalin II is operated by Sakhalin Energy Investment Company, Ltd, which is comprised of Gazprom, Royal Dutch Shell, Mitsubishi and Mitsui.Further Information: - Sakhalin II Oil and Gas project- Find a copy of the letter to the banks here "

Brussels ",Banks shun harmful investments,ASN Bank ,Netherlands,,,,"
Today sees the launch of the report ‘Ending Harmful Investments’ by Netwerk Vlaanderen in cooperation with BankTrack. The report discusses limits to investments in four damaging practices: the support of dictators, the infringement of labour laws, the destruction of the environment and the production of weapons. The report contains examples of pioneering financial institutions. The leaders in the field are the Dutch Algemene Spaarbank voor Nederland (ASN), the Italian Banca Etica, The Co-operative Bank from the UK and Triodos Bank. A number of traditional banks and pension funds are beginning to follow their example, albeit reluctantly. The arms industryThe report concludes that ASN Bank, Banca Etica and Triodos Bank completely avoid investments in the arms industry. Also Dexia excludes a large part of the arms industry from its own investments (but not from investments carried out on behalf of customers). Other financial institutions such as ING, Fortis, Rabobank and KBC draw the line at investments in businesses involved in controversial weapons such as anti-personnel mines, cluster munitions and nuclear weapons, but again, this only covers its own investments. KBC excludes producers of anti-personnel mines, cluster munitions and weapons with depleted uranium from all the products which it offers. BurmaAccording to ASN Bank and Triodos, it is impossible to do business in Burma without involvement in human rights abuses. The Co-operative Bank has specific policies for investments in businesses active in Burma. ASN Bank, Triodos Bank and The Co-operative Bank rule out investments in companies active in Burma. Also several large pension funds are restrained with regard to businesses active in Burma and therefore avoid investments in the worst aspects of the military regime. Large banks such as Fortis, ING and Rabobank state that they are not themselves active in Burma and that they do not fund any projects there. However, investing in businesses which are active in Burma is not a problem. Damage to the environmentASN Bank believes that oil and gas have too many negative social and ecological effects and do not offer a sustainable solution for the long term. ASN Bank therefore invests exclusively in alternative energy sources. Also The Co-operative Bank, Banca Etica and Triodos Bank are very cautious. Banca Etica does not invest in oil and gas. The Co-operative Bank does not finance any oil, gas or coal companies whose main activities contribute to climate change. All four avoid investments in businesses implicated in serious environmental damage. Also the policies of HSBC, Dexia’s insurance services and the Norwegian Government Pension Fund rule out investments in firms involved in some serious forms of damage to the environment. Infringement of labour lawsThe policy of banks such as ASN and Triodos also rule out investments in businesses which do not respect labour laws. Exploitation and child labour are incompatible with their business principles, and they refuse to finance companies or projects which are involved in these practices. The same is true for a number of large banks and pension funds, but the report shows that their policies are vaguer and less far-reaching. The report aims to help the financial institutions concerned to develop a less risky policy; it offers motivation and gives examples of institutions which already have a policy with clear limits on investments.""Ending Harmful Investments"" also gives examples of financial institutions with a transparent investment policy. For example, ASN Bank, Banca Etica and the Norwegian Government Pension Fund make all their investments public. They allow their customer to see what happens with their money.

Brussels ",Risk of harmful investments is too high for Belgian customers,,,,,,"
Today, the Belgian NGO Netwerk Vlaanderen publishes a ranking of the largest banks active in Belgium. The classification is based on a new research into the banks policies and investments. Netwerk came to the conclusion that bank customers still run an unacceptably high risk of involvement with harmful investments. Dexia and KBC achieve the best scores amongst the large banks. Deutsche Bank performs very badly. Therefore ""Burmese soldiers"" will congratulate the bank for its “good” score in the ranking this afternoon in a Netwerk action in the head office of Deutsche Bank in Brussels.  The risk of harmful investment varies between extremely high and very low. Deutsche Bank has achieved the worst score. They have taken no steps to avoid investments that damage humans or the environment. These findings coincide with the results of a new Urgewald study ""Deutsche Bank - ein fragwürdiges Markenzeichen"". That research shows Deutsche Bank investments in companies active in war regions, responsible for human rights violations or involuntary resettlements. Fortis, ING, AXA and Citibank customers have a very high risk of harmful investments. KBC and Dexia score slightly better but the risk for both these banks remains high. Out of all of the banks that were researched, only Triodos is doing well. The risk of damaging investment is low.  Mathias Bienstman, campaigner with Netwerk Vlaanderen says: “Bank customers still run an unacceptably high risk of damaging investments. Their money ends up with companies that destroy the rainforests of Indonesia, or support the dictatorship in Burma, for example. Up to this point no large bank has taken sufficient notice of the impacts of investments on the environment, labour rights, or the victims of dictatorial regimes.” The ranking  The score of each bank assesses the chance of involvement with investments that threaten peace, the environment, labour rights or democracy. Netwerk Vlaanderen researched the banks’ policies to avoid harmful investments. Without such a policy banks run a very high risk of involvement with harmful investments. A bank which avoids damaging investments in one domain will move one place up the scale. This is the case for Dexia and KBC which have effectively excluded investments in controversial weapons. Also Fortis, ING en AXA apply a policy that excludes controversial weapons. But their policy is up until now insufficient to totally avoid the risk of involvement with investments in these weapons. A bank that does not take any steps to avoid harmful investments moves one place down the scale. This is the case for Deutsche Bank.   World map with damaging investments  Netwerk Vlaanderen has revealed the damaging investments of banks active in Belgium on the website: www.banksecrets.be.  By clicking on the logo of a bank, a world map appears showing the damaging investments of that bank. The score of the bank in the ranking is also displayed, as well as the possibility to send an e-card to the person within the bank responsible for sustainability policy.   Burmese military congratulates Deutsche Bank for their ‘good’ score To launch the ranking, an action will take place this afternoon in the Brussels head office of Deutsche Bank. Burmese soldiers will congratulate the bank for its “good” score in the ranking. The bank can therefore continue to invest in companies that extract oil and gas in Burma. The gas extracted by Total alone contributes one billion dollars each year to the dictatorship.

Tasmania, Australia and Netherlands ",NGOs Welcome ANZ Decision Not to Finance Gunns Proposed Pulp Mill,ANZ ,Australia,Tamar Valley Pulp Mill Tasmania (formerly Gunns Pulp Mill) ,forestry - pulp and paper,Australia,"
The Wilderness Society (Tasmania) and BankTrack welcome the decision of ANZ not to provide funding to Gunns Ltd. for its controversial Tasmanian pulp mill project.


After months of conducting its own review of the pulp mill proposal, ANZ has allegedly declined to participate in a syndicate funding the $2 billion project, media have reported widely. In light of ANZ's new forests policy, its adoption of the Equator Principles, and recent mounting public pressure from civil society groups opposed to the project, the bank's withdrawal comes across as a commendable action, putting in practice the high environmental and social standards that it claims to subscribe to.


“Gunns’ pulp mill would see the destruction of high conservation value forests in Tasmania and the project does not have a social licence. ANZ’s decision is in line with its new forest policy and with principles that set a high standard for corporate social responsibility, for which they are to be congratulated,” said Mr Paul Oosting, Pulp Mill Campaigner for The Wilderness Society.


“Gunns’ pulp mill poses a huge reputational risk for any bank that gets involved due to the negative environmental and social impacts it will cause,” said Mr Oosting.


“This is a welcome example of a financial institution taking a responsible approach towards social and environmental issues, and we sincerely hope that ANZ's Australian and international peers would follow suit,” said Jeni Tasheva, campaigns officer at BankTrack.


While the move of ANZ will complicate efforts of Gunns to obtain sufficient funding, the company is currently seeking other options to finance the mill. Among potential financiers cited in the media are Macquarie Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, Deutsche Bank and several unspecified big Asian banks.


In the current context of heightened media attention and ANZ's withdrawal from the project, any bank that steps in to finance of the proposed paper mill would risk major negative publicity and becoming the target of concerted civil society organisations' campaigns.


“We strongly urge other banks and lenders to abstain from financing the pulp mill project, which is potentially damaging to both local communities and native Tasmanian forests of high conservation value,” said Tasheva, “ANZ had good reasons for the decision, and these count for other banks as well.”

Brussels, Montevideo ",New Report: European banks financing damaging agrofuels in Latin America,Barclays ,United Kingdom,,,,"
Many major European banks are funding the rapid expansion of agrofuel production in Latin America, leading to large scale deforestation, increasing human rights abuses and threatening food sovereignty, according to a new report released today.   The report - released by Friends of the Earth Europe amid global worries about the increasing impacts of rising food prices - calls for an end to investments by European banks in harmful agrofuel projects.   Agrofuels have been blamed as a major factor driving up food prices. According to the UN and the World Bank, 100 million more people are currently facing severe hunger due to higher prices for basic foods.   'European financing of agrofuel production in Latin America' documents how major European banks, such as Barclays, Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas, Axa, HSBC, UBS and Credit Suisse are investing billions of Euros in the production and trade of sugar cane, soybeans and palm oil in Latin American countries.  Fuels from sugar cane, soybeans and palm oil are increasingly used in Europe. Their large scale production in countries such as Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Colombia is extremely controversial as it leads to the destruction of the Amazon and other valuable ecosystems, as well as to the contamination of drinking water. Large scale plantations also lead to human rights violations against peasants, with working conditions on some plantations in Brazil classed as modern slave labour.  At the same time agrofuel companies are making record profits, enabled by loans, investments and other financial support from private banks. All major European banks have invested billions of Euros over recent years in agrofuel producing companies such as Cargill, Bunge, ADM, Cosan and Brasil Ecodiesel. Several of these companies have been involved in, and convicted of, illegal activities in Latin America.   Some examples of European banks involvement:

in 2007 Deutsche Bank owned 35 per cent of the shares of Brasil Ecodiesel
Bunge currently has credit facilities worth more than a billion Euro from 
banks such as Barclays, BBVA, BNP Paris, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, KBC and Credit Suisse
 in 2007 Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse provided financial services totalling more than a billion Euros to Cosan 

 Paul de Clerck, Friends of the Earth International corporate campaign coordinator, said: ""Agrofuels are a booming business and banks are out to make maximum money while millions of people are suffering from lack of food and the environment is being destroyed. Banks should immediately stop their investments in such harmful agrofuel development.""  Friends of the Earth is also calling on the European Commission to revise its plans for a mandatory 10 per cent target for the use of agrofuels in transport by 2020, which it says will exacerbate the problems associated with the production of agrofuels. Agrofuels are billed as a solution to climate change but growing scientific evidence shows that they may actually increase rather than decrease greenhouse gas emissions, especially if wider knock-on effects, such as changes in land use, are taken into account.  ""Using crops to feed cars instead of people is a false solution to climate change,"" added Mr de Clerck. You find the report for download here.
 *** NOTES:
 Biofuels are plants grown to make fuel instead of food. When they are grown in intensive agricultural systems, such as environmentally-damaging large-scale monoculture plantations, they are called agrofuels.   This number was cited by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on April 29 2008 when he announced a new task force to tackle the global food crisis.   In March 2007, the Supreme Court in Brazil judged that Cargill operated illegally while constructing a terminal on the banks of the Tapajos River to facilitate exports of soy beans without proper Environmental Impact Assessment. See fact sheet.  In March 2008 the Federal Regional Tribunal in Brasil ordered Bunge to immediately stop using wood as energy source for its facilities in Piaui due to the lack of necessary permits.

Berkeley ",New Financiers and the Environment,Bank of  ,China,,,,"
Financial institutions from countries such as China, Brazil, India and Thailand are playing an increasingly active role in financing infrastructure and mining projects around the world. For example, since 2007 with ICBC, Bank of China and China Construction Bank three out of the ten biggest banks by market capitalization come from China.  Although they invest in environmentally sensitive sectors, many emerging financiers do not yet apply internationally accepted standards in their projects.  The new report discusses the experience with environmental standards and how it can be useful for new financiers. It brings together experiences and perspectives of civil society, financial institutions, and academics from developing and industrialized countries.  Ten authors present case studies of overseas projects funded by Chinese, Indian and Thai financiers, and analyze the experience with environmental standards which could be applied by these financiers. The report is available for download (in English and Chinese) and from nicole@internationalrivers.org

New York, Edinburgh, Charlotte ","Protests at shareholders meetings of Citi, Bank of America and RBS",Bank of America ,United States,Mountain top removal coal mining ,mining - coal ,United States,"
Campaigners of BankTrack member groups in the US and the UK gathered yesterday and today at the Annual Shareholder Meetings of Citi, Bank of America and RBS to challenge the banks on their role in financing projects and activities that exacerbate climate change. The protests are part of an ongoing world wide effort to push banks to take up their responsibility for combating climate change.New York: Protests at Citi shareholders meeting Yesterday in New York activists with Rainforest Action Network (RAN) were joined by Appalachian residents at Citi’s Annual General Shareholder Meeting to protest the bank’s role as a leading financier of the coal industry and to support a landmark shareholder resolution on climate change.The resolution—which was offered by Boston Common Asset Management, Catholic Healthcare West and Pleroma Inc.—requested that Citi cease all financial support for mountaintop removal (MTR) coal mining and the construction of new coal-fired power plants. This marks the first time a shareholder resolution addressing the climate change implications of a bank’s external financing will come to a vote.“Banks are the top financiers of the world’s most carbon-intensive industries and could play a critical role in the transition to a low-carbon economy,” said Rebecca Tarbotton, director of RAN’s Global Finance Campaign. “Coal is a ticking time bomb for investors and the climate. Citi shareholders can either respond to the climate crisis with vision and leadership, or continue to lock in an outdated energy infrastructure for decades to come.”Charlotte, North Carolina: activists challenge Bank of America on lending $3.2 billion for new coal plantsThis morning activists with Rainforest Action Network (RAN) were joined by Appalachian residents, including retired coal miners, and dozens of North Carolina citizens at Bank of America’s Annual General Shareholder Meeting to protest the bank’s role as a leading financier of mountaintop removal (MTR) coal mining and new coal-fired power plants.Despite reaping publicity for its climate change commitments, including its recent signing of the Carbon Principles, Bank of America was part of a lending syndicate that provided $3.2 billion in financing to Duke Energy. The loan will enable Duke to move forward with plans to build several controversial coal-fired power plants in North Carolina and Indiana.Coal-fired power plants are responsible for nearly a third of the nation’s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. In 2006, emissions by power companies in Bank of America’s utility sector portfolio totaled 715 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2), equal to more than 10 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions for that year.""Unlike the credit crisis, we can’t bail out a dead planet,” said Rebecca Tarbotton, director of RAN’s Global Finance Campaign. “Bank of America’s reckless investments in new coal-fired power plants are locking in an outdated energy infrastructure that threatens our climate, our communities, and our economy.”In addition, Bank of America has financial relationships with each of the top five producers of MTR coal. These companies are responsible for nearly half the total MTR coal production of the top 20 most active MTR coal companies. The EPA estimates that more than a million acres across Appalachia have already been lost to MTR, and that if the practice continues unabated, an additional 1.4 million acres of forest will be lost by the end of the decade. Mountaintop removal flattens mountain ranges and transforms healthy mountain woodlands into toxic sludge and rubble that has clogged more than 700 miles of rivers and streams. The large-scale destruction forces animal species from their habitat and uproots Appalachian communities.Scotland: RBS put in trial for financing climate destructionMeanwhile today in Edinburgh, students together with PLATFORM put the Royal Bank of Scottland on a mock trial preceding the banks Annual General Meeting. The bank was found guilty of environmental and climate crimes and was given a suspended sentence to clean up its investments by 2009 or face a boycott. RBS was put on trial as part of a protest against its lending to environmentally destructive fossil fuel projects, such as its loan to E.ON the company hoping to build the first new coal power station in the UK for over 30 years, at Kingsnorth in Kent. Over 50 students from across the country gathered with props outside RBS’ flagship branch in St Andrews Square for the mock trial. Grey whales, boreal forest, oil pipelines and coal plant cooling towers were witnesses testifying to RBS' complicity in driving forward climate chaos. The protest is part of People & Planet's Ditch Dirty Development campaign which targets both private and public financial support for fossil fuel projects, aiming to increase spending on renewable and decentralised forms of energy. Pressure on banks increases The protests at the shareholders meetings this week are part of an ongoing effort by BankTrack to ask banks to respond adequately to the unfolding climate crisis, by divesting from all fossil fuel extraction and coal power plants.""The banks targeted in our actions are amongst the biggest financiers of fossil fuel extraction and CO2-intensive industries in the world. NGOs call upon the banks to take up their responsibility to the climate and change their lending from fossil fuel projects to renewable energy projects."" says Mika Mino-Paluello from Platform.“Smart banks see the writing on the wall; the era of fossil fuel is to come to an end; any euro invested in this sector is an investment in the past. What we need is banks that opt for investing in the future, that is, in a real shift towards financing renewable energy”, says BankTrack coordinator Johan Frijns. “This week’s protests help to bring that message forward.” "

New York ",Campaigners confront Citi over coal financing at annual shareholder meeting,Citi ,United States,Mountain top removal coal mining ,mining - coal ,United States,"
Activists with Rainforest Action Network (RAN) were joined by Appalachian residents at Citi’s Annual General Shareholder Meeting today to protest the bank’s role as a leading financier of the coal industry and to support a landmark shareholder resolution on climate change. The resolution—which was offered by Boston Common Asset Management, Catholic Healthcare West and Pleroma Inc.—requests that Citi cease all financial support for mountaintop removal (MTR) coal mining and the construction of new coal-fired power plants. This marks the first time a shareholder resolution addressing the climate change implications of a bank’s external financing will come to a vote.Coal-fired power plants are responsible for nearly a third of the nation’s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. In 2006, the combined CO2 emissions of Citi’s power company clients totaled an estimated 1,577 million tons, equal to 25 percent of the nation’s total greenhouse gas emissions. Citi is the top underwriter for American Electric Power—the country’s largest electricity generator and emitter of greenhouse gases—having provided more than $12 billion in financing over the past seven years.“Banks are the top financiers of the world’s most carbon-intensive industries and could play a critical role in the transition to a low-carbon economy,” said Rebecca Tarbotton, director of RAN’s Global Finance Campaign. “Coal is a ticking time bomb for investors and the climate. Citi shareholders can either respond to the climate crisis with vision and leadership, or continue to lock in an outdated energy infrastructure for decades to come.”Among those accompanying RAN at the shareholder meeting were community organizer Maria Gunnoe, a life-long resident of Boone County, W.Va. Gunnoe has experienced the destruction of mountaintop removal firsthand and has organized extensively around the issue in order to preserve the Appalachian way of life and communities throughout the region.“Citi’s carbon policy must address coal from the cradle to the grave,” said Gunnoe. “As long as the coal industry and its bankers wage war on the mountains and people of Appalachia, there will be no true carbon principles.”Citi has financial relationships with each of the top five producers of MTR coal. These companies are responsible for nearly half the total MTR coal production of the top 20 most active MTR coal companies.

Berlin, London ",ADB Pulls Out of Controversial Coal Project,,,,,,"
The
Director of the Asian Development Bank's Private Sector Operations
Department, Robert Bestani, notified the Bank's Board last week that it
will no longer ask for approval of the Phulbari Coal Project in
Bangladesh. The ADB's Board was slated to approve a US$ 100 m loan and
US$ 200 m political risk guarantee for the project on June 3, 2008.  This comes as another major blow to the UK based company GCM Resources
(formerly known as Asia Energy), which aims to establish one of the
world's largest open pit coal mines near the town of Phulbari in
northwestern Bangladesh. GCM/Asia Energy was forced to shut down its
operations and flee the project area after a major protest of over
50,000 people in 2006 that resulted in three deaths and hundreds people
injured as government-backed paramilitary forces fired upon the
protesters.  Since then and in spite of the Bangladesh
Government's Emergency Power Rules that ban major civil liberties,
widespread opposition in the project area has continued. National
opposition has been led by the National Committee to Protect Oil, Gas,
Mineral Resources and Ports (NC). Although its General Secretary Prof.
Anu Muhammad has received death threats and its local leader Mr.
Nuruzuman was publicly tortured by the military in February 2007, the,
NC and other civil society organizations have remained undaunted in
their opposition to the Phulbari project.  Prof. Muhammad
says: ""The area around Phulbari is extremely fertile and densely
populated. It is also one of the few regions in Bangladesh that are
safe from flooding and other natural catastrophes and therefore plays a
key role for the food security of the entire country. The proposed
""development"" project is merely a scheme to loot natural resources from
a poor country for the rich. We will not allow GCM Resources to turn a
land of food for the people into a black hole for corporate profit.""  According to the company's own estimates, the mine would displace some
50,000 people. However, an expert committee commissioned by the
Bangladesh Government in 2005 found these numbers to be grossly
underestimated. The expert committee reports that 130,000 people would
be displaced for the mine and a further 220,000 would be impacted
through the massive draw-down of the water table, which is necessary to
keep water from running into the 300 meter deep mine pit. This would
have major impacts on drinking water and irrigation for many miles
beyond the actual mine. Furthermore, the company has no viable plan to
prevent acid mine contamination of the soil and water as a result of
mining 15 million tons of coal for over 35 years.  Mining
expert Roger Moody notes: ""It is extremely costly to adequately prevent
and mitigate acid mine drainage in a mine of this size. The acid is
likely to stay in the environment for decades after the mine closes
contaminating the land, rivers and streams. And GCM has not provided
any financial details as to who would cover the bill for such an
environmental disaster.""  Various community leaders and
representatives of the Phulbari area wrote a letter to the ADB's
Executive Directors in December 2007, followed by a letter by over 60
international civil society organizations protesting ADB's involvement
in the project. International NGOs point out that the project would
also cause extensive damage to the Sundarbans mangrove forest, an
UNESCO declared World Heritage Site where the port facilities for
exporting the coal are to be constructed. As several of the ADB's
Executive Directors began raising questions about the environmental and
social feasibility of the project, the Bank's management finally
decided to take Phulbari out of ADB's funding pipeline.  Tim
Jones of the World Development Movement says: "" The Phulbari project is
truly a British and international scandal. GCM Resources is a British
company and is backed by banks such as Barclays (UK), UBS and Credit
Suisse (Switzerland). Among its other investors are the British hedge
fund RAB Capital and the mutual funds manager Fidelity from the US. The
ADB's decision sends an important signal to these institutions about
the unacceptability of their investment into this project.""  Bangladesh, British and international civil society organizations are
now calling on these financial institutions to follow suit and pull the
plug on the Phulbari coal project. "

Europe ",Protest rallies against Turkish dam all over Europe,Société Générale ,France,Ilisu dam ,energy plants - dams,Turkey,"
Critics of the ill-conceived Ilisu Dam in Turkey today held protests and rallies all over Europe in front government buildings, banks and companies involved in the dam project.


Actions were planned for Paris, Milan, Rome, Perugia, Berlin, Stuttgart and other German cities today, March 14, to mark the International Day of Action for Rivers, Water and Life. At least 77 organisations from 20 countries, including France, Germany and Italy, are all urging the governmental and financial institutions to withdraw from the project.


The protesters' case against the dam was bolstered by revelations in a new report that environmental and social conditionalities are not being followed. Indeed, the report – written by a committee of experts hired by European governments – shows that the social and environmental risks of the project are as great as anticipated by NGO critics.


“The expert report shows that all efforts to lift the project to international standards have completely failed. Since the approval of the guarantees, none of the conditions has been fulfilled,” says Yann Louvel, private finance campaigner at Friends of the Earth France.


The experts found that Turkish officials in charge of the project were completely unfamiliar with the additional social and environmental requirements, which were conditions of loans to the project from European financial institutions. Among their findings were that 200 additional experts would have to be hired for the resettlement plan alone, that plans to create an archaeological park with monuments from the flooded area are unlikely to attract tourists, and that those monuments cannot be transported without risk of destruction and damage. The experts also revealed that key environmental studies are missing.


The planned Ilisu Dam is extremely controversial because of its massive negative environmental, social and cultural impacts. At least 55,000 people would have to be displaced for the project and a 10,000-year-old town would be flooded.


Last year governments of Germany, Austria and Switzerland granted export credit guarantees for the project. They justified this support by attaching environmental and social conditions to the contracts, claiming that the project would then adhere to international standards.


But Heike Drillisch from the German organisation World Economy, Ecology & Development (WEED) asserts, “The European governments try to continue with business as usual and negotiate new deadlines with the Turkish officials. In reality, the report reveals the fiasco the European governments entered into by approving the export credit guarantees for Ilisu.”


“European governments, banks and companies must acknowledge that international standards cannot be met and withdraw from the project”, urges Antonio Tricarico from CRBM, Italy.


Protest actions are taking place in Paris (France): headquarters of Société Générale Milan (Italy): headquarters of UniCredit Group, owner of Bank Austria Creditanstalt Rome & Perugia (Italy): branches of UniCredit bank Berlin (Germany): chancellor’s office Stuttgart (Germany): headquarters of the construction company Zueblin Frankfurt (Germany): headquarters of DekaBank Hannover (Germany): branch of Savings Bank, member of supervisory board of DekaBank Karlsruhe (Germany): branch of Savings Bank, member of supervisory board of DekaBank

London, Washington, Sakhalin ",Environmental Victory for Sakhalin II,Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS)  ,United Kingdom,Sakhalin II oil and gas project ,oil and gas,Russian Federation,"
Pacific Environment, WWF-UK, Sakhalin Environmental Watch and other groups celebrate Sakhalin Energy's abandoned attempt at public financing from the United States and the United Kingdom.  Late yesterday Sakhalin Energy Investment Company, Ltd. (Sakhalin Energy) told Dow Jones that it is withdrawing applications for hundreds of millions of dollars in public financing for the crisis-plagued Sakhalin II project from the US Export Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank) and the UK Export Credit Guarantee Department (ECGD).   This announcement is a triumph for local environmental groups that have formed a coalition with national and international environmental organizations to block billions of dollars in public and private financing due to the chronic environmental impacts of the project. Sakhalin II, the world's largest integrated oil and gas project, located on and off-shore of Sakhalin Island in the Russian Far East, has been plagued by environmental problems, including threats to the critically endangered Western Gray Whales, damage to wild salmon spawning grounds, and negative impacts to indigenous and fishing cultures.   ""We celebrate this tremendous victory,"" said Dmitry Lisitsyn, Chairman of Sakhalin Environment Watch. ""Since its inception over a decade ago, Sakhalin II has committed severe environmental violations of these public banks' policies. Every day new negative impacts are being seen, including now in Aniva Bay, where project sedimentation is negatively impacting our local scallop fisheries.""  Dow Jones reported that Sakhalin Energy's decision to withdraw financing was due to ""serious concerns over possible delays"" in financing. However, Sakhalin Energy's statement neglects to mention that for five years the company has been unable to secure billions of dollars in public and private financing due in large part to the company's failure to demonstrate compliance with banks' environmental policies. In 2007, the public European Bank for Reconstruction and Development withdrew its consideration for financing of Sakhalin II in large part because the project could not demonstrate environmental policy compliance.  ""This announcement demonstrates that the Sakhalin II project's environmental problems are irreversible violations of the environmental standards of these public banks,"" said David Gordon, Executive Director of Pacific Environment.  In recent weeks, environmental organizations met with high level officials in Ex-Im Bank and other US agencies amidst widespread rumours within the government that Ex-Im Bank and possibly ECGD would cause the Sakhalin II application to be withdrawn as a way to avoid having to officially decline financing due in great part to environmental non-compliance.  ""We are happy that Ex-Im Bank and ECGD ultimately did not support a project that would compromise the integrity of their environmental policies,"" said Doug Norlen, Policy Director, Pacific Environment. ""But the banks had a responsibility to state their rejection publicly, rather than sneaking out the back door by asking Sakhalin Energy to withdraw its application.""  The withholding of Ex-Im Bank and ECGD financing for Sakhalin II greatly increases the political, financial and reputational risks of any other bank that has, or is still considering financing for the controversial project, including the Royal Bank of Scotland, and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, respectively. Also, the withholding of financing sends a strong message to oil companies seeking approval and financing for highly risky projects in the Arctic region.  “This welcome news may inspire banks such as RBS and SocGen to reconsider their continued support for the Sakhalin project; they expose themselves and their shareholders to an operation that wreaks havoc to the planet and that therefore more responsible institutions would have felt obliged to decline”, said Johan Frijns, coordinator of BankTrack.  ""Shell's consistent failures on Sakhalin II provide a stark example of why oil companies shouldn't be allowed into vulnerable Arctic regions such as the US Bristol Bay and Chukchi Sea,"" said James Leaton, WWF.

San Francisco ",“Carbon Principles” Another Nail in Coals Coffin,Citi ,United States,,,,"
Three of the nation’s leading banks – Citi, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley – released a set of principles yesterday that could affect lending to coal-fired power plants. The so-called “Carbon Principles” reflect the tremendous pressure felt by members of the financial industry for their investments in coal and other greenhouse gas-intensive industries. According to Rainforest Action Network (RAN), which is calling on banks to end all coal investments, the Carbon Principles are an important step toward recognizing the climate risks associated with financing coal plants but are limited by their lack of any binding commitments and their failure to address the impact of destructive coal extraction methods such as mountaintop removal mining.  “The proof is in the pollution,” said Rebecca Tarbotton, Director of RAN’s Global Finance Campaign. “If this policy prevents the financing of new coal, it will be productive.”  The principles, which call for greater due diligence by banks and utilities in assessing the climate and economic risks associated with the construction of new coal plants, are a sign that growing public support for a moratorium on coal development is finally influencing bank policy. However, the principles would not require banks to set firm reduction targets for their investments in the coal sector.  “Calling them the ‘Carbon Principles’ is an overstatement,” said Tarbotton. “A serious climate change policy would commit the banks to emissions reductions in their financing and extend beyond coal into other carbon-intensive sectors such as coal mining and the oil and transportation industries.”  RAN, which in the past successfully challenged several of the world’s largest banks – including Citi, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and others – to adopt project lending policies that help safeguard the environment and human rights, is currently pushing banks to stop funding coal and other carbon-intensive sectors that contribute heavily to climate change. RAN has called on banks to set meaningful reduction targets for their financed investments.  Since January 2007, RAN and its allies have organized more than 60 public protests at Citi bank branches across the country and thousands of online actions to pressure the financial giant to stop funding coal.

Amsterdam / Brussels ",ING Withdraws from Slovak Nuclear Project,Belfius ,Belgium,Mochovce nuclear power plant (units 3 & 4) ,energy plants - nuclear,Slovakia,"
Last week, the Dutch banking group  ING told Greenpeace representatives that it has withdrawn financial support for the construction of the Mochvoce 3 and 4 nuclear reactors in Slovakia. ING took this step after it had received information from environmental organizations on the  risks related to the Mochovce project.  According to a press release by the Slovak utility Slovenske Elektrarne (SE), ING was the lead bank that had coordinated a loan of 800 Million EURO from nine banks on October 23rd 2007 for the utility's investment program. Eighty-five percent of this investment program is destined to complete construction of the Mochovce 3 and 4 nuclear power stations. ING representatives said to Greenpeace: ""ING will not invest a single EURO into this project."" They promised that ING will neither invest through project loans, nor indirectly through corporate loans.   Greenpeace’s EU campaigner on nuclear energy, Jan Haverkamp says: ""This decision is an important signal. The Mochovce project is amongst the worst nuclear projects  in the pipeline in Europe. ING's refusal to finance it shows that Mochovce does not meet today’s social corporate responsibility standards.""  The planned VVER 440/213 nuclear reactors received a building permit from the Czech communist authorities in 1986. Although construction was halted in 1994, the permit was prolonged. In 2004, the Slovak government then decided it wanted to see  Mochovce 3 and 4 finished. It took this up in its negotiations with the Italian utility, ENEL, who bought 51% of SE’s shares and is now the majority owner of the Slovak utlity.  The Mochovce blocks are upgraded versions of the original 1970s design. But since most of the concrete has been poured and vital parts were already delivered in the early 1990s, the Slovak State Nuclear Agency UJD has confirmed that Mochovce 3 and 4 will not be able to reach modern safety levels. One of the most significant problems is that the plant has no containment structure, which is needed not only to keep radioactivity inside after an accident, but also to protect the reactors from external events, such as an airplane crash. The project has also never been submitted to an Environmental Impact Assessment, nor was there any public participation in its planning, because the Slovak government deems the 1986  construction permit to still be valid. “This is a clear violation of EU regulations,” says Heffa Schücking from the German NGO, Urgewald. “Mochovce is a dangerous project and will risk the health and lives of millions of citizens in the heart of Europe,” she adds.  Greenpeace, Urgewald and organisations from the BankTrack network and CEE-Bankwatch are now calling upon other banks from the consortium to also withdraw from the project. These banks include ERSTE Group (Austria), Dexia, KBC/CSOB (both Belgium), Intesa Sanpaolo (Italy), Societe Generale, Calyon (both France), and Mizuho (Japan). "

Sassenberg ",West LB Pulls Out of Controversial Gold Mine,,,Toka Tindung gold mine ,mining - non coal,Indonesia,"
The Indonesian province of North Sulawesi is a biodiversity hotspot and
harbors some of the world's most spectacular nature areas. Northern
Sulawesi is also home to a series of gold de-posits, the largest of
which is known by the name of Toka Tindung.
Plans to establish gold mining operations here have met with widespread
resistance both from local inhabitants and the Provincial government,
who fear that the mines would disrupt the ecology and the econ-omy of
the region, which is based on fishing, agriculture and tourism.  The British-based mining company Archipelago Resources, which is
attempting to force the development of the Toka Tindung mine, recently
received a serious blow, when the German bank WestLB did not renew its
credit arrangements with the company. WestLB is one of four banks,
which had originally agreed to provide project financing for Toka
Tindung. The other banks involved are Australia's ANZ and Investec and
the French bank Société Générale. NGOs are now calling upon these banks
to follow suit and to pull out of the controversial project.  ""We are amazed that WestLB held on to this project as long as they
did,"" says Heffa Schück-ing from the German NGO Urgewald. ""Since 2005
the people of Northern Sulawesi Province have consistently demonstrated
and spoken out against the project and both the provincial parliament
and the Governor have given a clear ""No"" to Toka Tindung. This and the
fact, that the company pushed forward construction without obtaining
valid permits is a clear indica-tion, that Archipelago Resources is not
a company that banks should invest in,"" says Schücking.  Activists believe that their threat to launch a public campaign against
WestLB in Germany played a role in the bank's decision to finally
withdraw from the project. ""Supporting a project, which local people
don't want and which will harm unique ecosystems, would have created a
lot of damage to WestLB's reputation,"" says Marianne Klute from Watch
Indonesia.  From the start, the gold mining project has been
contentious. In July 2006, the Indonesian Federal Environment Ministry
forbid Archipelago Resources' plan to dump tailings from the mine in
the ocean and the company thus put forward a plan to store tailings on
land. However, this solution is far from safe as the area is prone to
earthquakes and floods. The Governor of the Province, S.H. Sarundajang,
thus refused to grant a permit for the mine, which is located near the
Lembeh Strait, the Bunaken National Park and the the Tangkoko
Conservation Area. At a press conference in February 2007, Sarundajung
said that short-term extractive industries like gold mining don't fit
into the long-term sustainable development plans of this province and
stated, ""I prefer to be a green governor rather than allowing the
destruction of our envi-ronment.""  Archipelago Resources and
its Indonesian subsidiary have nonetheless moved forward with
construction, thereby enraging the local population and showing utter
disregard for the law. The company's security forces have time and
again attacked peaceful demonstrations by locals and there are many
accusations of corruption and unlawful intimidation against the firm.  Villagers claim that Archipelago Resources' illegal construction
activities have already resulted in unprecedented damage to the
environment. On March 11th 2007, 400 villagers of Rinondoran and
vicinity had to flee as their houses were buried under a 1.5 Meter
thick layer of mud. The avalanche turned the crystal clear water of
Rinondoran Bay into a stinky mud pool with hundreds of dead fish. The
villagers suspect that this was a man made environmental catastrophe,
caused by the construction activities of Archipelago Resources in the
hills above Rinondoran. The contract to construct the dumping ponds and
dams for the mine was granted to Bakrie constructions, which belongs to
the Indonesian minister Aburizal Bakrie. This is the same company that
is responsible for the mud volcano that has been flooding the region
Sidoarjo in East Java over the past months. Archipelago Resources,
however, denies any responsibility and speaks of a natural catastrophe.
 ""Archipelago Resources does not care about the law nor about
the people in our region,"" says Revoldi Koleangan of AMMALTA, the local
alliance of farming and fishing communities opposed to the project. ""We
are therefore glad to see that the company is losing support from its
financial backers and hope that it will soon be forced to leave the
province entirely,"" he adds. "

Edinburgh, London ",NGOs Call on Royal Bank of Scotland to recall Loan on Sakhalin II,ABN AMRO ,Netherlands,Sakhalin II oil and gas project ,oil and gas,Russian Federation,"
Nineteen local and international environmental organizations called today on Sir Fred Goodwin, CEO of Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), to recall a controversial $1 billion loan by ABN AMRO for the Russian energy giant, Gazprom’s purchase of a controlling share of the enormous Sakhalin II oil and gas project in Russia. Sakhalin II has caused many severe environmental problems and violates the Equator Principles, to which RBS has signed.  The groups also request to meet with Goodwin.  RBS leads a consortium of banks that purchased ABN AMRO in 2007.      Environmental groups opposed ABN AMRO financing for Sakhalin II because the project threatens the Western Gray Whale with extinction, damages hundreds of wild salmon runs, and negatively impacts local communities.  “When RBS bought ABN AMRO, it acquired the bank’s assets and liabilities, including financial and reputational, and thus the responsibility to address the wrongful financing of Sakhalin II,” said Dmitry Lisitsyn, Chairman, Sakhalin Environment Watch.  Environmental groups and independent consultants of potential lenders, including the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development  have for many years documented Sakhalin II’s severe, chronic and irreversible violations of bank environmental policies.  For private banks, this includes the Equator Principles on environmental performance, which both RBS and ABN AMRO have committed to follow.  EBRD eventually withdrew its consideration of Sakhalin II while many other banks suspended consideration of the project due to environmental problems.  “At the 2005 ABN AMRO Annual Meeting, Chief Executive Officer Rijkman Groenink committed to not finance Sakhalin II until it was brought into compliance with the Equator Principles,”  said Paul de Clerck of Friends of the Earth International, who was at the 2005 ABN AMRO Annual Meeting where the commitment was made. “So, it came as a complete shock when the bank circumvented the Principles by financing Sakhalin II through one of the project sponsors.  RBS must now take responsibility to correct this damage.”  “The buck now stops at RBS,” said Doug Norlen, Policy Director, Pacific Environment.

Utrecht ",Mind the Gap: BankTrack rates credit policies of 45 banks,ABN AMRO ,Netherlands,,,,"
The banking sector is showing progress in developing credit policies that deal with the social, environmental and human rights aspects of their operations, but this progress is slow and unequal, with some banks leading the way and many lagging far behind. Moreover, there continues to be a worrying gap between adopting stringent policies on the one hand and implementing them in day to day investment decisions on the other.This is the conclusion of 'Mind the Gap', a new report and web section launched today by BankTrack, the international NGO network monitoring the financial sector. The report, based on a ten month research project, evaluates the credit policies of 45 major international banks on three dimensions: the content of sector and issue policies, the level of transparency and accountability and the implementation of policies.  Outline of contentThe report compares the content of seven sector and seven issue policies against a 'good policy standard', as derived from international treaties, guidelines and best practices. Existing bank policies, or the absence of it, are then scored against this benchmark.  The research covers policies on agriculture, dams, fisheries, forestry, military industry and arms trade, mining, oil and gas, biodiversity, climate change, human rights, rights of indigenous peoples, labour rights, taxation and toxics.  A similar exercise is then undertaken for the bank performance on transparency and accountability on both institutional and deal level.  Finally, the report describes 30 controversial cases -referred to as Dodgy Deals- banks are involved in. They range from dams to mines, from controversial weapons to child labour, from oil pipelines to oil palm plantations, and from pulp mills to coal-fired power plants.  All findings are presented in a set of 45 bank profiles included in the report and on the website. A number of banks provided comments to the findings, which are included in the profiles.Selected Findings The report is packed with numerous observations and findings on the state of affairs on Banks' credit policies. Amongst these findings are:  

36 out of 45 banks have no policy on agriculture.


HSBC is the only bank receiving a maximum score of 4, for its dam policy.


Despite rapidly depleting fish stocks and widespread overfishing, only one bank has developed a policy on the fisheries and seafood sector (Rabobank, score 3).


Only 4 out of 45 banks have developed policies for the mining and the oil and gas sector, this despite the large adverse impact of these sectors on global sustainability (HSBC, ING, ABN AMRO, Barclays).


Banks are becoming well aware of the need to develop a climate policy, with no less than 31 out of 45 banks issuing statements of sorts on their policies or practices. Despite this, the overall quality is poor, lacking clear commitments on emission reductions.


The human rights commitments of Rabobank, scored with a 3, stand in clear contrast to the often vague and aspirational policies of all other banks (scored 1 or 0).


Not a single bank has developed a policy on tax avoidance and tax havens. Only BBVA (Spain) states that it does not support activities related to tax evasion by its clients.


34 banks publish an externally verified annual sustainability report which meets the basic requirements of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines and its Financial Services Sector Supplements. Transparency and accountability on deal level remains poor, with few banks providing any detail on specific clients and transactions.


The three Chinese banks surveyed (ICBC, Bank of China, China Construction Bank) all had no publicly available environmental or social financing standards; only ICBC participated in the Carbon Disclosure Project. 

Despite the progress made in development of credit policies, nearly all banks still find themselves involved in controversial deals, details of which are presented in the report.  Comments""All taken together, Mind the Gap does not paint a rosy picture of the banking industry"", says Ulrike Lohr, coordinator of the project for BankTrack. ""A few banks lead the way, too many fall behind; yet it is encouraging that banks pay increasing attention to the need to develop policies to deal with social and environmental risk way beyond the Equator Principles"". ""The long list of Dodgy Deals included in the report emphasise the need for stringent implementation of policies where they exist and the urgent need to develop such policies where they don't"" adds Michelle Chan-Fishel of FoE US. ""Implementing policies in the day to day business of a large banks is a huge challenge, but this is what civil society expects banks to do; to put their money where their mouth is.""  ""Banks must realise that no matter how good their policies are, the public will judge their performance not on transactions that proceed smoothly behind the screens but on the one deal that stands exposed as dodgy and in marked contrast to their stated sustainability principles"", said Andreas Missbach of the Berne Declaration; ""transparency is key to any credible sustainability strategy"".  ""We hope to establish a clear benchmark with this report. Banks should see 'Mind the Gap' as an encouragement to move further and faster towards achieving best practice in all sectors they are involved in. Much remains to be done and we will check again early 2009 how things have progressed"", says Johan Frijns, coordinator of BankTrack. "

Zurich, Utrecht ",UBS alerted over Phulbari Coal mine,UBS ,Switzerland,,,,"
UBS, a financial heavyweight from Switzerland, is facing scrutiny by    civil society organisations for investing in a proposed coal mine in    Bangladesh. The Phulbari coal mine, proposed by GCM Resources Plc,    is set to cause major social and environmental upheavals in the    region, displacing upwards of 50 000 residents. Despite strong local    opposition, investors UBS, RAB Capital and Barclays continue to back GCM with significant shareholdings. GCM    Resources' strategic focus is the mine, and financial institutions    with sights on easy profits derived from expropriation and significant    environmental damage, are propping up a shaky project which has already    been stalled for over two years.
Swiss based Berne Declaration and the BankTrack network    recently wrote to UBS  on behalf of local community representatives    outlining the grave environmental, social and human rights problems associated with the project. As proposed, the Phulbari Coal mine is ""open cut"" meaning    that between    140 and 300m worth of earth will need to be removed to access coal    seams deep under ground. Some 50 000 residents will need to be    relocated, potentially    reaching 200 000 should full scale expansion plans be realised.    Extensive damage to the UNESCO declared world heritage site    Sundarbans mangrove forest, the largest single block of mangrove    forest in the world, is also    expected from port facilities. Energy production from coal poses    substantial impacts on climate change, and is also inappropriate at a    time when Bangladesh is appealing to the rest of the world to curb    greenhouse gas emissions.
Despite the project having been reportedly cleared by advisors Barclays to satisfy the    Equator Principles, development standards which encompass community    and social considerations, the undertaking faces immense local    opposition. In August    2006, 50 000 people protested outside the local offices of Asia Energy    (now GCM Resources Plc). A paramilitary force peppered the crowd    with bullets, killing five people, including a fourteen year old    boy. Approximately 100 individuals suffered injuries from the shootings. Since    then, GCM Resources Plc has fled the site and the Bangladesh    government has signed an agreement with the local communities    promising that the coal mine would be stopped. In January 2007,    Bangladesh declared a state of emergency, and a military backed    government was installed. The current ruling party has proceeded to    infringe the fundamental rights    of countless citizens whilst maintaining relationships with    transnational corporations in an attempt to stoke foreign investment    and additional income.
Without the developer's presence in the region and fearing reprimand    from a heavy handed government, local opponents to the projects have    little recourse within their own country or with project sponsors.    Responsible financial institutions have been approached with evidence of    environmental damage and extensive social harm, and have been asked    to respect the human rights of those affected by divesting. The    Berne Declaration and BankTrack have offered to put financial    institutions in direct contact with communities in the area.     Responding to questions about their 11% investment listed in GCM    Resources Plc, the second largest listed shareholding, UBS denies    any strategic interest in the    company. The large multinational communicated that ""it does not    comment on potential or specific    client relations or transactions or its investments in any particular    company"". UBS vaguely asserts to civil society and the communities    affected that its holding may or may not be on behalf of other people.     Andreas Missbach from the Berne Declaration says ""responding to victims    of actual and potential human rights abuses in this way, UBS has shown    complete disregard for its duties to stakeholders, selectively and    irresponsibly hiding behind bank secrecy provisions"".     The transparency of financial institutions' shareholdings is of major    consequence to determine who is responsible for facilitating dodgy    investments. Determining whether banks themselves are actual    shareholders, or whether they are holding shares on behalf of another    party, can sometimes be an impossible task for local communities. Banks    have been known to take advantage of these vagaries to shun their    responsibilities.    Whoever are the real shareholders in GCM, by virtue of their    involvement in share listings,    financial institutions must fulfil their duty to respect the human    rights of stakeholders. "

Utrecht, Bali ",Banks challenged to fight climate change,,,,,,"
International banks are key financiers of activities and operations that contribute to climate change. Therefore, banks must take up their responsibility and adopt stringent  policies and practices that will reduce their negative climate impact and make them contribute to positive change. To do so requires hard choices of banks, especially regarding their involvement in the fossil fuel sector.  This is the key message of a new paper launched today by BankTrack, the international network of NGOs monitoring  private banks. The paper, 'A Challenging Climate; what international banks should do to combat climate change' outlines the key elements of a  advanced bank policy on climate change:  Banks should disentangle themselves from activities and projects that substantially contribute to climate change. They should cease supporting all new coal, oil and gas extraction and delivery, new coal-fired power plants and the most harmful practices in other GHG-intensive sectors.  Banks should then minimize the extent to which their other activities contribute to climate change. They should assess and report on all Greenhouse Gas emissions associated with their loans, investments, and other financial services; establish stringent portfolio and business-unit emissions reduction targets and time lines, and develop the necessary tools to address climate issues across the full range of their operations and services.  Finally banks should increase their support for the development and use of climate-friendly technologies and production processes by increasing support for emissions reduction technology, renewable energy production and energy efficiency in all business lines, and by developing products and services that will help retail and other customers to address climate change.  The report also lists which energy projects BankTrack considers 'solutions' (wind, small hydro, solar, biomass and several other technologies) and those which must be considered 'false solutions' (nuclear power, large hydro, sustained use of gas, biofuel) to meet the climate challenge.  The report especially singles out nuclear power as a no-go area for banks eager to diversify their energy portfolio, clearly stating the climate challenge does not provide opportunity for a revival of the nuclear industry. The release of the report at the time of the Bali Climate summit (COP-13) is part of ongoing efforts by BankTrack and its member groups to influence energy investment decisions of banks, away from fossil fuel exploration, development and (coal power) generation, towards low/no carbon energy options. ""All large banks nowadays seem to have a climate initiative of sorts; but these barely scratch the surface of what really needs to happen. At the end of the day, the continued financing by banks of new oil and gas development projects the world over will be seen by an increasingly critical public as amounting to complicity in climate destruction"" says Johan Frijns, coordinator of BankTrack  Financing new coal power plants must quickly become a thing of the past"" says Becky Tarbotton, Climate campaign coordinator with the Rainforest Action Network. ""The business potential of financing the energy shift towards renewable is staggering; what looked like a niche market only a few years ago is now turning into a fast growing multi billion dollar industry. All the signs point towards an essential shift  to a low/no carbon economy to protect the climate; smart banks will get out of coal and go for that market."" ""Banks, because of their role of financiers in virtually every sector of society could play a major role in helping to combat climate change"", Sebastien Godinot of Friends of the Earth France commented. ""Imagine what would happen if banks would insist on climate commitments of all their clients, in the same way as they routinely assess them on other business aspects - it would provide a major boost to decarbonise the economy"" ""Too many things pass for solutions to the climate crisis these days, nuclear power being one of them "", says Heffa Schuecking of Urgewald. ""But you can't solve the climate crisis by creating another crisis. Nuclear power will make future generations pay dearly for our unwillingness to make hard choices today."" "

Brussels ",Bank Secrets Cracked,,,,,,"
Today, the financial watchdog Netwerk Vlaanderen NGO (B) launches the report ‘Bank Secrets’. The dossier details the investments by 121 financial groups in companies violating fundamental human rights. The investors channel money to 13 companies selling weapons to dictators, denying people access to land and clean water, co-operating with armed rebel groups and being involved in forced relocations and heavy and irreversible pollution. International banks involved121 banks from 24 different countries play a role in the financing of these companies, including banks based in Abu Dhabi, Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, DRC, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mauritius, The Netherlands, Peru, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, the UK, the US and the multilateral World Bank.Netwerk Vlaanderen reports that for the period 2003 – 2007, loans add up to a total of US$13 billion. Furthermore, during the period 2004-2007 banks have arranged and underwritten bond issues to a total value of US$ 28.4 billion. During the same period, the companies were assisted in issuing shares to a total value of US$ 14.8 billion.Investors complicit to human right abusesAlthough the human rights abuses are well documented, financiers keep on supporting the involved companies. The lack of sustainability standards in their investments policies, allows them to channel money to companies like AviChina, which sells military material to China, Burma and Sudan. Because of violations of human rights in these countries, the European Union decided on an arms embargo. By financing AviChina, investors undermine this embargo. Other reported investments include the support to mining companies which systematically pollute the environment. The Australian company Emperor Mines, for example, exploits a gold and silver mine in an ecologically and culturally precious area in Papua New Guinea. Emperor Mines dumps monthly 14.000 tuns of toxic waste - containing lead, chromium, arsenic, cadmium, nickel and copper - in the local river. Thousands of people depend on the water for fishery and small scale agriculture. This does not stop several major international financial groups from backing the company financially.These are just some examples of the practices detailed in the report ‘Bank Secrets’. The overall picture is staggering and continues to provoke fierce reactions from bank personnel and clients.Bank personnel and clients reactIn Belgium the report was launched in co-operation with LBC the largest union in the financial sector. Stefaan Decock, spokesperson from the union, states: “These kind of investments can no longer be tolerated. We think that financial institutions should take important environmental and human rights norms into consideration in their investment decisions. We continue to work for an ethical bottom line: no money for dictators, serious environmental destruction, controversial arms or violations of labour rights.”“Investors should not wait until they are found legally responsible for the violations of human rights and serious environmental damage. They should make sure they don’t generate profit from such controversial practices. Financial institutions have a huge leverage power and can contribute to positive change.”, said Inez Louwagie from Netwerk Vlaanderen.

São Paulo and Brasília ",Environmentalists go to court to suspend auction Rio Madeira Dam Project,,,Rio Madeira dams: Jirau and Santo Antonio ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"
Friends of the Earth - Brazilian Amazon filed a civil lawsuit on Wednesday (Dec. 5th) in the Federal Courts, requesting the suspension of the Santo Antônio Hydro Power Plant project auction, in the Madeira River (state of Rondônia, in the Amazon), scheduled for December 10th. A previous lawsuit, filed by the Federal Prosecutor Office has been ruled in favour by two of the three judges of the Federal Courts responsible for the decision and can, as soon as it is deemed possible, reverse the validity of the Madeira project.  The NGO based its lawsuit on information that was used to justify the granting of the license, last November, by IBAMA, the federal environmental agency. Official data regarding the explosion in deforestation in that particular area since the granting of the preliminary license, was also used to file the lawsuit. The Federal Prosecutor Office also questions the withdrawal of the transmission lines for the purposes of obtaining a licenses.   IBAMA granted the preliminary license on July 9th of this year, but its final judgment became public only in November. The draft, signed by the current director of licensing Messias Franco, shows that the main shortcomings identified by the organization, in March of this year (details in note 1 below), were never the subject of further investigation during later reports. Therefore, the new executive board of Ibama, which replaced the one which denied the license, was responsible for an illegal act.   “Many suggested this illegality by the time the license was granted, but now it is proved and acknowledged by Ibama itself” said Roberto Smeraldi, director of Friends of the Earth. ""It seems that IBAMA attempted to delay the disclosure in order to facilitate the auction, preventing the preliminary license from being questioned. But there is still time for the courts to prevent this manipulation.""   The civil suit is also justified since the reports regarding deforestation are alarming. Deforestation exploded in the project area, and especially in the municipalities that were not the object of environmental studies, which was limited only to Porto Velho. Official data from DETER (an online deforestation monitoring system), collected by the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), show an increase of deforestation in the Rio Madeira basin of more than 600%, between July and September, as reported by the national press. Actions such as the official granting of the preliminary license signal illegal activity participants, such as illegal land claimants, that this is the time to reconsider their actions. ""This is an irreversible impact, that can only be mitigated from now on if the justice impose the realization of serious studies in the entire area of influence”, said Smeraldi.  The judgement from Ibama staff of experts, dated March 2007, denied the preliminary license, claiming numerous failures on the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) developed by the consortium Furnas/Odebrecht, and determined the realization of new studies. Similar failures were detected by independent specialists commissioned by the Public Prosecuting Office of Rondônia Sate, which were paid by the consortium in the end of 2006 (details in Note 2 below).   But the Ibama executive board was replaced, with its new members ignoring the judgment from their own staff experts, and later conducting some partial studies by external consultants, all paid by the Ministry of Energy. The preliminary license was granted some weeks later.   “This is a scandal. Political and commercial interests must not subvert a licensing process like this. If this project is indeed important for the country, it should abide to our legislation, assessing its real impacts, which are of paramount importance to determine the real costs”, comments Gustavo Pimentel, of Friends of the Earth.  A civil lawsuit by the Federal Prosecuting Office, filed last March, challenges the way the licensing process was conducted and requests that any license granted on those grounds must be cancelled. Two judges from the Federal Court in Brasília have given votes favoring the civil lawsuit. The third judge has asked for more time to analyse the issue, thus the decision is yet to be finalized.   Last Tuesday (4), more than 250 indigenous leaders from the Amazon submitted a petition to President Lula requesting the suspension of the Santo Antônio dam project. They claim that indigenous peoples were not made aware of the licensing process, despite the assessment’s certification that there are indirect impacts to many indigenous territories, and even isolated tribes.  With the auction approaching, civil society is accelerating campaigns against the dams. The Dam-Affected Movement (MAB) has scheduled public demonstrations in Porto Velho this Monday (Dec.10th). Friends of the Earth Brazil and International Rivers launched a cyber action where people can send emails to President Lula demanding a Rio Madeira free of dams. (see note 3).   Note 1 Judgement of Ibama experts, March 2007  “Given the high level of uncertainty in the process; the identification of affected areas not considered in the Assessment; the uncertainty of the degree of impacts along with the absence of measures for mitigation and environmental controls necessary to ensure the sustainable use of natural resources and the well being of communities; and the mandatory compliance with the Precaution Principle, the team experts concluded it is not possible to analyze the environmental viability of Santo Antonio and Jirau dams, which is fundamental for the realization of a new and broader Environmental Impact Assessment, both in national and trans-border territories, and the organization of new public consultations. Thus, we recommend the Preliminary License not be granted.”

Germany ",Nationwide Protests against Investment in Turkey’s Ilisu Dam,,,Ilisu dam ,energy plants - dams,Turkey,"
Kurdish groups and NGOs organized demonstrations outside local branches of the German Sparkasse (Savings Bank) and Deka Bank in eleven German towns today. The protests are targeting the two banks financial support of the controversial Ilisu dam in south-eastern Turkey that will submerge the ancient city of Hasankeyf. Deka Bank alone is underwriting construction of the hydropower project with more than 100 Million Euros.  “With the financial contribution from DekaBank, more than 55,000 people will be deprived of their livelihoods,” says Ercan Ayboga, member of the Initiative to Save Hasankeyf. “The whole ecosystem of the Tigris will suffer an ecological disaster and our 12,000 year old cultural heritage will be destroyed.”  Demonstrations take place in Berlin, Hamburg, Bremen, Hanover, Düsseldorf, Cologne, Aachen, Bonn, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Munich. Activists demonstrate in front of Sparkasse branches and alert customers how Deka Bank is irresponsibly investing their money in Turkey.  “Customers of the Sparkasse ought to know that their money finances the destruction of cultural goods and the forced displacement of people in Turkey,” says Heike Drillisch of the development organisation WEED. “We don’t think the customers will appreciate that.”   The Ilisu dam project is highly controversial. Several German and Swiss banks have already refused to participate in the project. And, while export credit agencies of Austria, Germany and Switzerland granted the project financial guarantees; they also tied 150 conditions to those guarantees to mitigate ecological and social problems. Non-governmental organisations reject financing Ilisu as such, charging the financial support is a blatant violation of international standards. Worse yet, the conditions set by the export credit agencies were completely ignored during expropriation of the first villages.  Deka Bank advertises its cultural sponsorship with the slogan “Create Opportunities,” but Johan Frijns of BankTrack says, “In Hasankeyf and its surroundings Deka Bank is taking away opportunities for people to save their culture and to live their lives.” Illegal expropriations have already started.

Europe ",Say No to Belene Nuclear Plant!,BNP Paribas ,France,Belene nuclear power plant ,energy plants - nuclear,Bulgaria,"
Say no to Belene and join the protest
European Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs is sitting in the hot seat. In the coming weeks, the Commission is expected to issue an opinion on the Belene nuclear power project (NPP) in Bulgaria. If the project is approved, it would clear the way for the Bulgarian government to apply for loans from public institutions such as Euratom and the European Investment Bank. Jan Haverkamp from Greenpeace remarks: “This will be a landmark decision since Euratom has not provided a loan for the construction of new reactors in more than 20 years. And it would be the very first time it supports the construction of Russian reactors within the EU.”   NGOs from throughout Europe are therefore mobilizing citizens to write to the European Commission. “Belene is one of the most dangerous and controversial NPPs in the pipeline and we are alarmed to see the Commission ignoring the project’s immense safety risks,” says Heffa Schücking from the German NGO Urgewald.   The Facts on Belene The plan to build a nuclear power plant (NPP) near the town of Belene in northern Bulgaria goes back to the early 1980s. Even then, Soviet scientists warned that this site is seismically active and thus unsuited for a nuclear power station. During the last large earthquake in the region, over 120 people died just 14 kilometres from the planned NPP site. In the early 1990s, Belene was scrapped and the first democratically elected Government in Bulgaria determined the project to be “technically unsafe and economically unviable”. This was shortly after the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences issued a 421-page study, which came to a negative assessment of the project and specifically warned against the seismic risks of this location.  In 2002, however, the Belene project was revived, and in 2006, the Bulgarian government awarded a contract to the Russian company Atomstroyexport to build two reactors of a new design in Belene. The so-called Russian AES 92, or VVER 1000/466B reactors have not been licensed anywhere in the world, and there is no safety assessment or operational experience for this reactor type. One of the leaders of the Bulgarian NGO coalition BeleNE!, Albena Simeonova says: “I’m amazed that our government is willing to pay up to 7 billion euro to turn our country into a testing ground for the Russian nuclear industry. I hope that the EU will not support this plan.”  Private Banks Pulled Out Private banks have largely been reluctant to provide loans for Belene. Recognising the project’s immense reputational risks. Banks from Germany, Italy, Switzerland and the US all declined loan applications for Belene in 2006. In fact, the only bank known to support it (albeit with a small loan) is the French bank BNP Paribas. In reaction to a wave of NGO protests throughout Europe, Badouin Prot, CEO of BNP Paribas, promised that his bank would not provide further loans for the project. Whether or not BNP Paribas keeps its promise, Belene is definitely in financial dire straits as the project will require an enormous amount of capital – estimates are currently around 7 Billion euro.   If the Commission, however, gives its approval, Belene would be eligible to apply for loans from Euratom and the European Investment Bank. This in turn could increase the likelihood of private banks re-entering into the project.  “If the Commission wants to secure the health and safety of European citizens, it should not issue a positive opinion on a project, which soviet scientists, former Bulgarian governments and numerous commercial banks all assessed as negative,” says Heffa Schücking of Urgewald. “Europe’s public and private banks must stay away from a project that will put millions of European citizens at risk,” she adds.    Urgewald, Greenpeace, CEE-Bankwatch, BankTrack, Friends of the Earth and many other NGOs are currently mobilizing protest emails to the European Commission. Join the protest and write to the Commissioners of the European Union.   "

San Francisco ",Thousands on Streets to Protest Citi and Bank of America’s Coal Investments,Bank of America ,United States,Mountain top removal coal mining ,mining - coal ,United States,"
Rainforest Action Network (RAN) turned out thousands of activists in more than 50 cities across the U.S. today to protest Citi and Bank of America’s investments in new coal-fired power plants and dirty coal extraction methods such as mountaintop removal coal mining. RAN is pressuring the two banks to divest from coal and invest in renewable energy sources such as wind and solar.  The National Day of Action – organized by RAN, Coal River Mountain Watch, Appalachian Voices, Rising Tide North America, Mountain Justice Summer, Student Environmental Action Coalition (SEAC), Energy Justice Network and others – featured everything from flyering and leafletting at local bank branches and ATMs to creative street theater and non-violent direct action at bank offices. Cities in which actions took place included San Francisco, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, New York, Las Vegas, Charlotte, Portland, St. Louis, Denver, Chicago, Boston and Houston.  “Today’s strong turnout is a reflection of the public’s anger with these banks over their role in funding the new coal rush. Coal has devastating impacts on local communities and public health, and coal-fired power plants are the world’s top contributor to global warming,” said Rebecca Tarbotton, director of RAN’s Global Finance Campaign. “Citi and Bank of America are hereby on notice that unless they stop investing in global warming and start investing in the future, public actions like today’s are just the beginning.”   According to Bloomberg, Citi was the coal industry’s top underwriter in 2006 and is a leading lender to companies proposing to build new coal-fired power plants across the United States. If built, these plants would emit more than 600 million tons of carbon dioxide annually, undermining all other attempts to reduce emissions and prevent climate change.  Both Citi and Bank of America, in addition to funding new coal plants, also invest heavily in companies that practice mountaintop removal coal mining, a destructive coal extraction method that is responsible for the loss of millions of acres of forests and mountains and the decimation of communities throughout Appalachia. The carbon contained in forests destroyed each year by mountaintop removal is roughly equivalent to the carbon emissions of two 800-megawatt coal-fired power plants. "

Brussels ",Too Risky for Business,,,,,,"
Activists from the Belgian and International Coalitions to Ban Uranium Weapons, Netwerk Vlaanderen and Friends of the Earth today organised a “radioactive buffet” for staff in the entrance hall of the Brussels offices of The Bank of New York Mellon. The buffet was organised to oppose the involvement of the bank in funding the production of controversial depleted uranium weapons. These weapons are both chemically toxic and radioactive, and have caused serious health consequences for both military and civilians.The radioactive buffet was one of many events taking place around the world to mark the publication of 'Too Risky for Business. Financial Institutions and Uranium Weapons', a report that details the role that 47 international banks support the manufacture of uranium weapons. The report shows the involvement of the Bank of New York mellon in supporting uranium weapon producers ATK, General Dynamics and GenCorp.Activists wearing tuxedos and ball gowns distributed “radioactive” food and drinks to the staff of the bank, while musicians played classical music. The action was organised to highlight the consequences of the bank’s investment in the US arms companies ATK, GenCorp, and General Dynamics. These companies are three major producers of uranium weapons, which contain radioactive and chemically toxic depleted uranium. The dangers of Uranium WeaponsDepleted uranium is a radioactive and chemically toxic waste product from the nuclear industry. It is used in anti-tank weapons and in the armour of tanks. The use of these weapons creates clouds of tiny metal particles that contaminate the battlefield and surrounding environment for millions of years. Scientific research has shown that depleted uranium causes cancer, birth defects, and other serious health problems. These effects have been recorded in both soldiers and civilians, and are evident well after the end of the armed conflict leaving a legacy of disaster..Towards a banThere is a growing awareness that these weapons violate the most fundamental human rights. Military trade unions, human rights organisations and the environmental and peace movements are all calling for a world-wide ban on the production of uranium weapons. In June 2007 Belgium published a law that bans depleted uranium weapons. Belgium became the first country in the world to implement a ban on the manufacture, use, storage, sale, acquisition, supply and transport of uranium weapons. The ban on uranium weapons also raises questions about financial institutions that are contributing to the production of these deadly weapons.Too risky for Business?The companies who produce these weapons are readily supplied with capital by large financial groups, investments that make the production of these weapons possible. This is the conclusion of the report 'Too Risky for Business. Financial Institutions and Uranium Weapons.', published today by Netwerk Vlaanderen (B), the International Coalition to Ban Uranium Weapons (ICBUW), and BankTrack.The research report shows that more than 40 financial institutions are currently investing in producers of uranium weapons. Three US stock market listed companies: Alliant Techsystems, GenCorp and General Dynamics, are supported by financiers from Canada, the US, Japan, Great Britain, France, Germany, Taiwan, Singapore and Italy. In the period July 2004 – June 2007, these institutions guaranteed credit facilities worth a total of at least 3 billion US $. The financial institutions have also underwritten the issuing of 4.2 billion US $ in bonds and 120 million US $ in shares in these companies. Various financiers also hold significant shareholdings in the producers of uranium weapons. David Heller, of Friends of the Earth stated: “The civilian and military community calls on investors to act responsibly and put an end to their support for the production of Uranium Weapons. A number of investors have already taken this step. Others will hopefully follow. Governments also have an important role to play here. Just as with a ban on investments in weapons such as anti-personnel mines and cluster munitions, governments can ensure that banks are no longer legally able to invest in producers of uranium weapons.” Via actions in many countries, the International Coalition to Ban Uranium Weapons calls on the banks mentioned in this report to take a positive step and implement an investment policy that no longer allows this sort of investment.

Washington DC ","Coalfield Residents, Activists and Students Close Down D.C. Citi Branch",Citi ,United States,Mountain top removal coal mining ,mining - coal ,United States,"
Rainforest Action Network (RAN), Coal River Mountain Watch, the Student Environmental Action Coalition (SEAC) and students from around the country shut down a Washington, D.C. Citi branch yesterday by performing a theatrical “die-in” and delivering a bundle of coal to the financial giant. The protesters, in Washington for this week’s major youth climate conference Power Shift, called on Citi to stop funding the leading cause of global warming in the United States: coal.  “There is no room for coal in America’s energy future if we are going to avoid catastrophic climate change” said Rebecca Tarbotton, director of RAN’s Global Finance Campaign. “We have better options. Citi could be a real climate leader if they directed their financing towards efficiency and renewable energy. As it stands, dollar for dollar, they’re the biggest climate criminal in the country.”  According to Bloomberg, Citi was the coal industry’s top underwriter in 2006 and is a top lender to companies proposing to build new coal-fired power plants. If built, these plants will emit more than 600 million tons of carbon dioxide annually and negate nearly every other effort to combat climate change. While Citi finances this coal rush, leading climate scientists are recommending drastic reductions in global emissions in order to prevent climate chaos. Citi is also a top financier of companies that practice mountaintop removal coal mining, a coal extraction method that is decimating Appalachian mountains and communities.  “At home in Appalachia, coal companies are literally bombing our homes and mountains,” said Hillary Hosta of Coal River Mountain Watch. “They are operating illegally, poisoning our air and water, and driving us out of our homes. I want Citi to realize that their coal investments are destroying real people’s lives here in the United States.”   “Young people realize that climate change is a matter of life and death for ourselves and future generations, and we will do whatever it takes to tackle the root causes,” said Faye Bibeau, a lead organizer with SEAC. “Citi is going to be in for a rude awakening when they realize that youth today will not stand for their money being used to finance coal and climate change. They can say goodbye to student credit card customers if they continue to fund coal”. "

Bucharest ",Greenpeace study warns Cernavoda inhabitants of tritium dangers from nuclear power plant,,,Cernavoda nuclear power plant (units 3 & 4) ,energy plants - nuclear,Romania,"
Today,
the international environmental organisation Greenpeace presented a
study on tritium emissions  from the Cernavoda nuclear power
plant. It commissioned the study from the international tritium
expert Dr. Ian Fairlie from the United Kingdom. The study recommends
that pregnant women, nursing mothers, and  children (under 4) should
not live within 10 kilometres of the Cernavoda nuclear power plant,
and that people living within 5 kilometres should not consume food
from their gardens, beehives, orchards, and wild foods growing
nearby. The study also calls for a special commission to be set up to
study Cernavoda tritium emissions and recommends that plans for
Cernavoda 3 and 4 be halted until further studies are completed .
Dr. Ian Fairlie, an independent expert
who worked for several British government departments and regulatory
agencies and currently advises NGOs, the European Parliament and
local authorities on tritium issues, presented his findings to an
audience of Romanian scientists, representatives from
Nuclearelectrica, the Ministry of Environment, the town of Cernavoda
and several institutes.
Tomorrow Dr Fairlie will present his
findings to the population of Cernavoda . He states “The CANDU 6
design that is used at the Cernavoda nuclear power station is known
for its far larger emissions of tritium than other reactor designs.
There is much scientific uncertainty around the health impacts of
tritium. Authorities should take this uncertainty seriously and act
preventively rather than expose the population to possibly large
risks.” He explained that, in particular, pregnant women as well as
small children are more sensitive to radiation risks.
Jan Haverkamp, Central Europe energy
expert for Greenpeace, commented: “The Environmental Impact
Assessment of the Cernavoda reactors 3 and 4 downplays the tritium
debate. Not even the proposal for an Environmental Authorisation of
the units 1 and 2 that was issued day before yesterday reflects this
debate. Greenpeace finds that inexcusable and is of the opinion that
the people of Cernavoda have the right to base their own private
decisions on the fullest information on the matter.” He added: “If
I were to live near a CANDU reactor, I would like to talk with my
partner and weigh all factors – the higher risk because of tritium,
our work, our social contacts and so on. I would not want to be
patronised by authorities who say that everything is OK when serious
doubts exist.”
Greenpeace commissioned Dr. Ian Fairlie
with this study for several reasons. First of all, Dr. Fairlie is the
author of a similar study, also commissioned by Greenpeace, of the
effects of tritium emissions from Canadian CANDU reactors .
Because of its findings, Greenpeace is of the opinion that it had the
moral obligation to extend this study to CANDU reactors elsewhere in
the world. Also, Greenpeace participates actively in the
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the Cernavoda 3 and 4
reactors and has concluded that the EIA report was heavily biased
towards nuclear power. It has demanded in its comments a more
balanced view including also negative aspects of the technology like
the effects of large accidents, terrorist risk, the effects of
nuclear fuel production, the lacking solution for the problem of
nuclear waste and the true risks of tritium emissions – all lacking
in the current report .
Finally, adding up all the problems
that surround nuclear energy, Greenpeace demands that the Romanian
government looks more seriously at the alternatives to nuclear power,
including the policies  in the recently published Energy evolution
Scenario . This scenario points out that a focus on energy
efficiency, decentralisation of electricity production and the
development of renewable energy sources is a not only a viable but
also cheaper alternative to the current energy policy of Romania,
which is based mainly on new nuclear power and fossil fuels .
Haverkamp: “Nor in the Romanian energy policy debate of this
moment, nor in Cernavoda's Environmental Impact Assessment such an
alternative is seriously included. Why continue exposing people to
nuclear risks when there is a better alternative? Why do we not look
seriously at the alternatives?”
 

Notes for editors: Tritium is the radioactive form of
hydrogen. It is generated in very large amounts in CANDU reactors
because of neutron radiation of heavy water – an essential part of
these reactors. It is impossible to contain tritium in the nuclear
power station and CANDU reactors emit several tens or hundreds of
times more tritium than  pressurised water reactors or boiling water
reactors used elsewhere. Tritium can pose a health risk when
incorporated in the human body, where its  beta-radiation can damage
cell-function and DNA.
 The results of the study are
available on internet:

London, Edinburgh, Burma ",Royal Bank of Scotland profits from Burmese oil,Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS)  ,United Kingdom,,,,"
The Royal Bank of Scotland was warned today that its assets could be supporting the Burmese junta. A letter from Burma Campaign UK, PLATFORM and BankTrack warns that through its stake in Bank of China, RBS capital could be invested into and RBS profits could derive from Burmese oil and gas. The RBS controls 8.25% of Bank of China, key backer of Chinese oil companies propping up the military regime in Burma. Petrochina and Sinopec have been criticised heavily for co-operating closely with the Burmese military rulers.  Both named Bank of China as their principal banker  and continue to borrow and repay loans of hundreds of millions of dollars.  Bank of China arranged a $1.1 billion loan to Sinopec in 2005, which is being paid back until Nov 2010. This November, Bank of China plans to underwrite further $2.7 billion of bonds to Sinopec.Only this September, Sinopec began drilling an onshore well in a joint venture with the Burmese regime’s Myanmar Oil & Gas Enterprise. The launch ceremony on September 26 coincided with the first day of the dictatorship’s brutal crackdown on civilian dissent and was attended by military officials and Sinopec executives.In August 2007, the Burmese military confirmed the sale of natural gas from the Shwe gas fields to Petrochina. Earlier in 2007, Sinopec signed a US$ 1 billion contract for the  construction of an Arakan-Yunnan oil pipeline.  Sinopec and Petrochina run many exploration, extraction and pipeline projects, many operated jointly with the Burmese regime.Oil & gas ventures in Burma have been repeatedly condemned by human rights organisations as propping up the regime. Sales of natural gas, such as those to Petrochina, account for the single largest source of revenue to the military government. RBS is not a silent partner in the relationship. The bank controls 8.25% of the Bank of China and owns around 4.5% outright, making it the most significant private shareholder.  RBS has publicised its “close co-operation” and “strategic partnership” with Bank of China, covering corporate governance and risk management. Through its stake, RBS CEO Fred Goodwin is a director on Bank of China’s board.Bank of China made $5.5 billion of profit in 2006 , of which a substantial proportion was passed on to RBS. As Sinopec and Petrochina repay their loans, RBS could be banking profits derived from Burmese crude. Through Bank of China loans, RBS is enabling the Chinese oil companies to expand their operations.In their letter, Burma Campaign UK, BankTrack and PLATFORM are warning RBS that it risks supporting or profiting from the Burmese dictatorship, unless it takes public steps to immediately change the Bank of China’s lending practices or sells its stake. Mark Farmaner of Burma Campaign UK said “Support for oil & gas drilling in Burma is support for the regime. RBS must ensure that Bank of China provides no financial services that underwrite the junta.”Johan Frijns of BankTrack said “Banks must recognise the responsibilities that derive from their loans and investments. RBS must ensure its loans stop supporting human rights abuses and climate change.”Mika Minio of PLATFORM said “RBS’s holdings are fuelling repression by financing fossil fuels in Burma. Whether it’s human rights or climate change, the bank is in denial over the impacts of its core business. RBS must stop dodging responsibility and do the right thing – stop financing destructive fossil fuels.”

Zürich ",Genocide in Darfur,Credit Suisse ,Switzerland,,,,"
The genocide in Darfur relies mainly on the income of the Sudanese government from the oil industry. Involved are also Swiss financial institutions such as UBS or Credit Suisse which in total hold around 6 billion US dollars worth of investments in the controversial oil companies in Sudan. UBS plans, furthermore, to underwrite PetroChina’s IPO (initial public offering) on the Shanghai stock exchange on 5 November, despite massive international criticism. The non-governmental organisations Society for Threatened Peoples, Berne Declaration, Genocide Intervention Network and Bank Track demand that the financial institutions reconsider their investments.  In today’s media conference, the non-governmental organisations Society for Threatened Peoples, Berne Declaration, Genocide Intervention Network and BankTrack have disclosed the involvement of Swiss banks in companies engaged in the Sudanese oil industry. Around 70 percent of Sudan’s oil income is spent on military purposes. According to Genocide Intervention Network, PetroChina, Sinopec (China), Petronas (Malaysia) and the Indian Oil and Natural Gas Company (ONGC) belong to some of the “highest offenders” and thus are directly or indirectly connected with the genocide in Darfur. PetroChina is furthermore investing over a billion US dollars in a pipeline project in Burma, which will provide the military junta with an income of 150 million US dollars per year.  A large number of Swiss financial institutions own investments in the above mentioned oil companies - the UBS group owns investments with a stock market value of 2.7 billion US dollars and the Credit Suisse group up to around 2.8 billion US dollars. Several cantonal and private banks also own investments with a stock exchange value of millions of US dollars. Above all, UBS Securities Co. is planning to underwrite PetroChina’s IPO on the Shanghai stock exchange on 5 November 2007. This would lead to one of the greatest sales of shares in the region, with an estimated value of 5.9 billion US dollars.  The genocide in Darfur can only be stopped with the additional use of effective economic pressure - this is why the four organisations call on the Swiss banks to urge their business clients acting in Sudan to take consistent measures to prevent their direct or indirect contribution to genocide. If the oil companies in question do not react, the financial institutions should pull back. In this case, the UBS must resign from underwriting PetroChina’s IPO. Christoph Wiedmer, the manager of the Society of Threatened Peoples demands: “Economic players can no longer deny its responsibility in regions where human rights abuses of this dimension are taking place. Either the investors achieve a change of thinking in the concerned governments and oil companies, or they should cancel their business relations with the problematic companies.”  These financial connections of banks with companies supporting Sudan’s oil income are only one, albeit grave, example of how banks can come into conflict with human rights. This is why Andreas Missbach from the Berne Declaration demands: “The major banks UBS and Credit Suisse must create substantial, attainable and transparent human rights guidelines, in order to avoid becoming an accomplice in human rights violations.”    "

São Paulo ",High financial risks for Rio Madeira Dam Project,,,Rio Madeira dams: Jirau and Santo Antonio ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"
Technical, legal, social and environmental uncertainties increase financial risks to investors and creditors of Rio Madeira Dam Complex in the Brazilian Amazon, says a report published today by Amigos da Terra – Amazônia Brasileira. The report is the first of its kind for Rio Madeira, providing a rounded analysis of the project based upon a similar methodology employed by credit rating agencies which translates different aspects of the project into the level financial risks.   The study argues that crucial potential impacts have not been adequately addressed such as failure to study the impacts of canal locks, and the contradictory technical assessments on broad issues including the project’s area of influence, possible impacts in Bolivia, indigenous lands, involuntary resettlement and extent flooding. The fee for environmental compensation, which is still undefined, may also affect cost and construction timeline.   Construction risks for the Rio Madeira Complex was yet another aspect of the risk analysis commonly ignored by financiers, as cost explosions are common for hydroelectric plants in the Amazon. The study analyses the possibility of delays, cost overrun and quality sub-performance along with their respective impacts. A second major threat is the legal weakness of the preliminary license and, consequently, of the construction license, which may result in postponement of the project, delaying the energy delivery. Similarly, the granting of the environmental license is based weak grounds, and is already being challenged by the Public Prosecution Office.   Gustavo Pimentel, Eco-Finance Manager at Amigos de Terra says that taking off the transmission line from the terms of reference to speed up the power plants license may backfire. “Now there is a risk of having two large power plants in the middle of the Amazon disconnected from the consumption centers in the southeast. The transmission line to Araraquara (state of São Paulo) does not have a defined path, nor any terms of reference for the Environmental Impact Assessment. Its license will take years to come, and nobody can predict when the works will be complete”.   Amigos da Terra is engaging with banks and pension funds about the study’s conclusions. “No creditor would like to enter this deal to lose money. Everybody we talk to is worried about the project’s financial risks. The beneficiaries of Petros and Funcef pension funds should be very concerned, as their pensions may be at stake”, argues Pimentel.

Berlin, Turkey ",Arbitrary expropriation at Ilisu dam site,,,Ilisu dam ,energy plants - dams,Turkey,"
The European Ilisu campaign has learned during a site visit, that without the knowledge of responsible authorities in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Turkish government has begun to expropriate the first affected villages at the controversial Ilisu dam site on the Tigris river in a move that violates conditions imposed by European export credit agencies.  
 
Expropriated people are extremely angry at this development and the affected population’s overall indignation at the Ilisu dam project is growing. Christine Eberlein of the Swiss organisation ""Berne Declaration"" and member of the European Ilisu campaign observed this when she visited the villages of Ilisu and Karabayir in mid-October. Her report reveals the miserable compensation packages offered and the unfair processes by which the Turkish authorities are forcing the affected families to resettle. A Kurdish Human Rights Project delegation made similar observations in September during a visit to the affected areas.  By attaching 150 conditions to their approval of export credit guarantees, the governments of Germany, Austria and Switzerland intended to ensure that those facing resettlement receive fair compensations and new income possibilities. Although the final guarantee contracts have not yet been signed, the Turkish government has started the expropriations – completely ignoring these conditions.  No adequate resettlement alternatives were offered to the affected families, as the conditions demand. As a result, all families have been left with little choice than to accept financial payment which does not adequately compensate them for their losses. In addition to farming, many of the affected individuals in Ilisu earn a living from tourism. The loss of this income will not be compensated for at all. The families whose lands have been expropriated feel cheated and have challenged the compensation levels in the local courts. However there is little scope for them to challenge the fact of the actual expropriation. It is especially ironic that the head of Ilisu village, who came to Germany, Austria and Switzerland last year at the invitation of the Ilisu consortium to promote the construction of the dam, has now voiced his frustration with the expropriation process in a letter to the European ECAs and asks for immediate support.  ""The first badly run expropriations reveal the full tragedy of the Ilisu dam project” states Heike Drillisch of the German non-governmental organisation WEED, which has monitored the Ilisu dam project for many years. NGOs alerted the export credit agencies (ECAs) to the lack of adequate resettlement land a long time ago. “It is a shame that the agencies believed obviously unsubstantiated assertions by Turkish officials. The affected population is now faced with ruin.” Christine Eberlein adds: “The conditions are completely worthless if they can be ignored so easily by the Turkish government. The ECAs now say that they take our concerns very seriously. Had they been more diligent in their assessment of the project in the first place, they would have easily foreseen the problems that are now arising, and would never have become involved.” The NGOs demand that the export credit agencies press for corrections to the expropriation process and insist that conditions be honoured, or withdraw from the project immediately. They call on the private banks and companies involved in the project to put their engagement on hold until a satisfactory solution to the expropriation and resettlement problems is found.  BackgroundThe governments of Germany, Austria and Switzerland approved export credit guarantees for the Ilisu project of some €500 million at the end of March 2007, enabling Andritz AG (A), Ed Züblin GmbH (GER) and Swiss companies Alstom, Colenco, Maggia and Stucky, to profit from the project. The private banks DekaBank (GER), Bank Austria Creditanstalt (A) and Société Générale (F) signed financing contracts in August 2007. The final guarantee contracts have yet to be signed.  The Ilisu dam project will affect between 55,000 and 78,000 people, mainly Kurds. At least 11,000 people will lose all of their land. The expropriation has started in the villages next to the construction site, including the villages of Ilisu and Karabayir. ECA representatives have called the re-settlement of the affected people in these villages a test for the expropriation of the villages in the future reservoir area, which will take place at a later stage.  The European Ilisu campaign, a network of European organisations including Amis de la Terre (F), Berne Declaration (Switzerland), Eca-Watch Austria, Forests and the European Union Resource Network (FERN, Brussels), Kurdish Human Rights Project (KHRP, UK), The Corner House (UK) and World Economy, Ecology & Development (WEED, Germany), has been monitoring the Ilisu dam project for many years in close cooperation with the local Initiative to Keep Hasankeyf Alive. BankTrack is a network of non-governmental organisations focusing on the role and responsibilities of the financial services sector in fostering sustainability.

Charlotte, North Carolina ",Activists Drape 50-Foot Banner Across From Bank of America Headquarters,Bank of America ,United States,Mountain top removal coal mining ,mining - coal ,United States,"
Environment  Activists with Rainforest Action Network's (RAN) Global Finance Campaign draped a 50-foot banner reading ""Bank of America: Funding Coal, Killing Communities"" across the street from Bank of America's downtown Charlotte, N.C., headquarters this morning. The group is urging the financial giant to stop funding mountaintop removal coal mining and the construction of new coal-fired power plants.A highly destructive method of coal extraction, mountaintop removal involves exploding the tops off of mountains to reach the coal within and dumping the rubble in adjoining valleys - choking streams and increasing flood risks for local communities. Bank of America has invested billions of dollars in companies that practice mountaintop removal in the Appalachian region, including Massey Energy, Arch Coal and Alpha Natural Resources. These companies are responsible for the loss of millions of acres of forests and mountains and the decimation of communities throughout Appalachia.""Mountaintop removal and dirty coal plants have no place in our modern economy,"" said Rebecca Tarbotton, director of RAN's Global Finance Campaign. ""Mountaintop removal flattens mountain ranges and transforms healthy mountain woodlands into toxic sludge and rubble that clogs mountain streams. Communities throughout Appalachia are being devastated by this shameful practice. If Bank of America and other financial institutions would shift their investments from coal to renewable energies such as wind and solar power, we could meet all our energy demands by mid-century without using any coal at all.""""Here in West Virginia, coal companies are using 3 1/2 millions pounds of explosives a day to bomb our homes and mountains,"" said Julia 'Judy' Bonds, founder of Coal River Mountain Watch. ""They are poisoning our water and our air. I want Bank of America to realize that when it funds coal companies, it is ruining lives and killing our communities.""More than 150 new coal-fired power plants are currently being planned throughout the U.S. at a projected cost of $125 billion. These plants will emit millions of tons of carbon dioxide and other dangerous toxins, such as mercury, into the atmosphere annually. RAN is urging banks to follow the recommendations of NASA's chief climate scientist, Dr. James Hansen, who has called for a moratorium on all new coal-fired power plants. A United Nations scientific panel tasked with studying the issue also warned against further development and construction of conventional coal-fired power plants. "

the Netherlands, Tasmania ",New ANZ CEO Mr Smith asked to not finance Gunns pulp mill Tasmania,ANZ ,Australia,Tamar Valley Pulp Mill Tasmania (formerly Gunns Pulp Mill) ,forestry - pulp and paper,Australia,"
BankTrack, a network of 24 international civil society organizations tracking private finance, along with The Wilderness Society and Rainforest Action Network, today unveil www.tellmrsmith.org. The new interactive website describes Mr Smith's opportunity to prevent large-scale environmental, economic and health impacts, and gives people around the globe the chance to tell ANZ’s new chief not to support Gunns Ltd’s destruction of Tasmania’s native forests and their proposed pulp mill.Mr Smith is a man with an extraordinary task. He will assume the role of ANZ’s Chief Executive Officer from October 1st and will take responsibility for ANZ’s environmental and social impacts. Mr Smith arrives at a time when ANZ is heavily involved with Gunns Ltd and their controversial pulp mill. If the mill were to proceed, it would spell disaster for the one of the world's remaining great natural areas, dramatically increasing logging and burning of native forest, and spilling deadly chemicals from the mills' chlorine based bleaching process into Tasmania's waters. Since 1995 ANZ has provided crucial financial services to Gunns. Today ANZ provides the company with secured bank loans with a current debt thought to be more than AU$300 million (US$250 million). Relative to the pulp mill ANZ is understood to have advised on the project and is also the lead arranger. Further, Gunns management states that ANZ is certain to provide project finance, underwrite the mill, and that the bank has already arranged export credit deals from Europe. Mr Smith can put a halt to the project and prevent widespread impacts by ending support for the destruction of Tasmania’s native forests and Gunns’ proposed pulp mill.Mr Smith arrives at ANZ from his previous position at HSBC, one of four international banks which founded the Equator Principles (EPs) in 2004. EPs are environmental and social principles that ANZ promises to apply to Gunns' new project. Concerns regarding the environmental, health and economic impacts of the proposed mill worry local residents, whilst procedural irregularities and major gaps in the environmental assessment documentation create an enormous risk that the ANZ will fail to live up to its environmental commitments, including the Equator Principles. Mr Smith is now being asked to bring ANZ in line with their environmental and social commitments and prevent further damage by Gunns. ANZ so far has managed to kept out of the spotlight regarding Gunns, however a new chapter in the bank's drive for sustainability opens as Mr Smith assumes his executive  responsibilities. David Barnden from BankTrack comments “Mr Smith has a wonderful opportunity to show ANZ’s customers, the Australian public, and the world true leadership and commitment to uphold banking industry standards.” Whilst Mr Smith receives petitions from across the globe, the mega-pulp mill awaits final assessment by Australia’s environment minister, Mr Turnbull. In Australia the project enjoys widespread opposition and critical media coverage, and is becoming one of the key political issues as federal elections fast approach. In Mr Turnbull’s Wentworth electorate, constituents overwhelmingly opposes the mill's approval which, along with the Chief Scientists' upcoming report, will weigh in heavily on his decision. Uncertainty over the mill increases as Mr Turnbull distances himself from the controversial actions of Tasmanian Liberal leader Mr Lennon who ushered fast-track legislation through Tasmanian parliament after Gunns repeatedly failed to meet the state’s established environmental standards. Gunns Ltd has a market capitalisation well under the AU$2 billion (U$S 1.6 billion) cost for the pulp mill and relies heavily on ANZ to finance the project. Without ANZ's help, Gunns' pulp mill project will likely fail.You can tell Mr Smith to stop supporting Gunns destruction of Tasmania’s irreplaceable forests by visiting www.tellmrsmith.org  "

Berlin/Frankfurt ","NGOs condemn signing of the contracts for Ilisu Dam by Société Générale, Bank Austria and DekaBank",Société Générale ,France,Ilisu dam ,energy plants - dams,Turkey,"
The Turkish government and German DekaBank, French Societe Generale and Bank Austria have signed the financial contract for the highly controversial Ilisu Dam in Southeast Turkey.
Earlier this week, the final delivery contracts were signed already with the construction companies, including Andritz AG (Austria), Alstom Switzerland and Zueblin (Germany). A broad coalition of non-governmental organizations and civil society initiatives in Europe and Turkey criticize the European banks for entering into this project with devastating ecological, social and cultural impacts. At the same time, villagers in the reservoir area resist their expropriation by going to court.""By supporting the Ilisu project, Société Générale, Bank Austria and DekaBank demonstrate a deep disregard of environmental criteria and extreme disrespect for the affected population"", states Heike Drillisch of the environmental and development organisation WEED. ""The destructive potential of the Ilisu dam exceeds everything that would be conceivable in Europe. No responsible bank would take part in it."" The World Bank and other European banks had declined to fund the project.""Ilisu is more than a cultural, human and environmental catastrophe in Turkey"", states Ulrich Eichelmann from eca-watch Austria. ""It is a European scandal demonstrating how little attention companies, banks and politicians involved give to international standards, when great sums of money are involved.""The Ilisu project will dam the Tigris shortly before the border to Syria and Iraq, and will flood the antique city of Hasankeyf as well as countless further cultural sites and valuable habitats for threatened animal species. Tens of thousands of affected people, predominantly Kurds, will lose their current basis of existence. Protests of the affected population and Iraqi government were ignored. ""The project documents reveal that not even the fundamental data concerning the environment and the cultural properties which are given to the destruction are available"", emphasises Heffa Schuecking of the environmental and human rights organisation urgewald. At the end of March, the German, Austrian and Swiss governments granted export credit guarantees for the Ilisu project. These agreements are tied to about 150 obligations, which are supposed to bring the project in line with international standards. They include the demand to collect basic data on the ecological and cultural assets in the affected region. ""Without the presence of reliable data and management plans, the World Bank would not even start to assess the project"", states Christine Eberlein from Swiss Berne Declaration.Meanwhile, the expropriation of property has started in the Ilisu region under gross violation of the obligations imposed by the export credit agencies, according to information by the 'Initiative to Keep Hasankeyf Alive'. Consequently, nearly all families concerned filed complaints against the responsible water authority before court. However, the water authority announced not to accept the judgement. In no case the sums will be sufficient to enable families to achieve an adequate livelihood in the surrounding cities.""All our former concerns are confirmed by how expropriation is starting"", criticizes Ercan Ayboga of the 'Initiative to Keep Hasankeyf Alive'. ""The people are given pittance and are abandoned to their fate. The resistance in the region will continue. DekaBank and the other banks should be aware of this.""Whoever hopes that by signing the contracts the resistance will fade away, is mistaken"", the NGOs confirm. ""We will continue to inform people in Europe including the involved banks' clients about this incredible project and its flaws.""The charity organisation medico international recalls the German government's continued obligation to stop the project. ""We urge all parties represented in the German parliament to have a parliamentary delegation to Hasankeyf investigate the disrespect by Turkish authorities for the conditions tied to the export credit guarantees"", demands medico international's Martin Glasenapp.Non-governmental organizations WEED - Eca-Watch Austria - Berne Declaration - Initiative to Keep Hasankeyf Alive - BankTrack - Network - medico international -Informationsstelle Kurdistan - Verband der Studierenden aus Kurdistan (yxk) - Zanin Hannover - International Rivers Network (IRN) - urgewald "

London ",RBS profits threatened by fossil fuel financing,Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS)  ,United Kingdom,,,,"
As the Royal Bank of Scotland prepares to announce its interim 6-month  profits on Friday, NGOs warn that the bank’s financing of oil & gas  projects may threaten current & future profit margins. Calculations  indicate that the bank is carrying unaccounted for current carbon  liabilities of up to almost £1 billion, over 20% of the bank’s interim  profits.  In 2006, RBS’ estimated embedded emissions resulting from loans to oil &  gas extraction totaled over 43.7 million tonnes carbon dioxide . If  costed according to a social price calculated by Sir Nicholas Stern ,  these carbon liabilities add up to £940 million over six months -  equivalent to over 20% of RBS’ expected interim profits.  Even at the EU’s carbon trading figure  – generally recognised as  lower than the real cost of carbon, due to overly generous permit  allocations - internalising these costs would set RBS back £598 million  per year.  The bank’s forays into conflict areas bring further risks. RBS is  working to source financing for a $6 billion gas project in the Niger  Delta involving Shell. The Olokola LNG project threatens to displace  local communities and cause conflict. The largest rebel group in the  Niger Delta, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, has  threatened “It is inconceivable that  they can be protected from our  ability to sabotage the Olokola facility. We will test the integrity of  that protective measure.”   RBS’ insurance divisions have been particularly hard hit by the recent  extreme weather events and floods that hit England, widely associated  with climate change , could bring £300 million of claims to Direct  Line & Churchill, through which RBS controls 16% of the home loans  market.   Mika Minio-Paluello from Platform said “Unless the bank begins to  recognise its climate responsibility and take its carbon liabilities  seriously, shareholders may be in for a revenue shock in the future. On  its current course, RBS faces a double whammy – greater insurance losses  as a result of climate change; and higher costs should Governments  impose financial charges to reduce climate changing emissions.”  Duncan McLaren of Friends of the Earth Scotland said: “RBS seems happy  to claim kudos and credit when it funds renewable energy projects, yet  rejects any accountability for the emissions that result from the oil  and gas projects it finances. Such double standards cannot be good for  the reputation of Scotland’s biggest business.” Bronwen Thomas of national student network People & Planet said “We are  calling on RBS to accept responsibility for the climate impacts of its  lending. Climate change is and will remain one of the biggest issues  amongst students.” ------- ”The Oil & Gas Bank”, PLATFORM, Friends of the Earth Scotland,  BankTrack, People & Planet, new economics foundation http://www.carbonweb.org/documents/Oil_&_Gas_Bank.pdf The methodology attributes funder liability for carbon emissions from  financed projects in proportion to the share of funding provided. The  report does not imply that all emissions of financed projects be  allocated to the bank – merely those corresponding to the proportion  financed. The figure of 43.7 million tonnes CO2 is the share of annual  emissions from active projects funded by the bank.   “Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change” http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/stern_review_report.cfm   http://www.pointcarbon.com/ The current trading rate for EU carbon allowances is €20.25.   http://www.unitedijawstates.com/ndpvf.htm  “Gas emissions blamed for downpours” FT 24.07.07   “Banks balance gloom over dollar and floods crises with upbeat  results” Sunday Herald 29.07.07 "

Brussels ",AXA disinvests from landmines and cluster munitions,,,,,,"
In a official communication AXA announes to pull out investments of companies that produce anti-personnel mines and cluster munitions.  This is surprising good news from the Paris headquarters of this bank-insurance company. For last years AXA has shown heavy reluctance to adopt stricter weapon investment policies.  One step ahead The decision by AXA to disinvest from anti-personnel mines dates from 2006. AXA claims to have fully implemented this policy now. Disinvesting from cluster munition producers is a new move in the AXA investment policy. The group refers to the emerging international consensus around a ban on cluster bombs and to the ‘Oslo process’. This initiative by Norway already managed to get more than seventy countries working on an international treaty against cluster munitions.Campaigns are successful The campaign ‘My Money. Clear Conscience?’ by Netwerk Vlaanderen, Vrede, Vredesactie and Friends of the Earth Flanders & Brussels has now managed to convince all five most prominent banks in Belgium to disinvest from anti-personnel mines and cluster munitions. But not merely Belgian organisations raised the pressure on AXA. In 2006 Amnesty International FR and Handicap International FR started campaigning against these investments. In March 2007 both NGO’s even decided to break up their insurance contracts with AXA. Limited responsibility This new policy by Axa is an important step ahead. But AXA still doesn’t take its full responsibility. This exclusion policy only covers AXA’s direct investments. The general account insurance assets, including the invested insurance premiums, will no longer be invested in producers of anti-personnel mines and cluster munitions. But an investor buying shares of an AXA investment fund has no reason to be at ease. Such investments ‘on behalf of third parties’ are not covered by the new policy. Through AXA investment funds investments in producers like Lockheed Martin, ATK and Raytheon will go on. And this is not a minor exception. In 2006 52% of AXA’s € 1,315 billion assets under management were ‘on behalf of third parties. So the new policy merely covers half of AXA’s investments.Transparency needed Above that there is still a lack of transparency at AXA. The group just states it’s policy on anti personnel mines is fully implemented. But no information on the identified and excluded companies is published. AXA claims to use independent experts to assist in identifying producers. But a public ‘black list’ is needed to be able to fully assess and control AXA’s new policy. AXA: Communication - 2007 "

London, Edinburgh, Utrecht ",RBS adopts climate rhetoric while financing global warming,Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS)  ,United Kingdom,Canadian tar sands ,oil and gas,Canada,"
Following release of RBS’ Corporate Responsibility  report today, environmental NGOs have welcomed RBS’ financing renewables and recognition of climate change as a threat. Yet major concerns remain over RBS’ distortion of the reality of its support for fossil fuels and its continued refusal to accept responsibility for the climate impacts of its loans, unlike other banks. 
Mika Minio-Paluello of PLATFORM said “Following our March report, RBS have dropped the title ""The Oil & Gas Bank"" and moved from climate denial to recognition that climate change is a major threat. We see this as a campaign success, but remain concerned that the bank continues to obscure its full impacts on the climate.” Duncan McLaren of Friends of the Earth Scotland said ""We wish this represented a fundamental shift in RBS' approach to climate change. However, the reality is that RBS's lending practices and policies will continue to drive climate chaos."" PRACTICE RBS continues to obscure the true reality of its financing of fossil fuels. The CSR report makes much of the $2.6 billion RBS provided to renewables project finance in 2006, while playing down the $2.9 billion provided to oil & gas project finance. However, this focus solely on project finance creates a false impression that the bank’s support for renewable energy is comparable to its support for fossil fuels. General corporate finance far outweighs project finance and includes extensive support for oil & gas and very little for renewables. In one loan to ConocoPhillips alone, RBS acted as administrative agent on $22.5 billion of credit facilities.  Only two days before publication of the CSR report, RBS spent $1.35 billion acquiring majority shares in Sempra Commodities - a company specialising in marketing crude oil and coal.  Mika Minio-Paluello of PLATFORM said “Due to RBS’ refusal to act transparently, it’s near impossible to estimate its corporate finance loans to renewables. However, we’re pretty confident that in 2006, the bank provided well over $10 billion to fossil fuels – more than five times that provided to renewable energy.“ The 2006 CSR report also fails to mention the community, environmental and social concerns raised by the highly controversial projects it was intimately involved in during the year, including gas in the Niger Delta and highly polluting oil sands in Canada. The first has led to concerns over conflict, environmental destruction and community relocation. Extraction of oil sands in Alberta faces major opposition over alleged contribution to high cancer rates, destruction of the boreal forest and excessive carbon emissions. Johan Frijns of BankTrack said “ If RBS is as serious about climate change as it claims, it would increase transparency over all financing of energy, not only project finance, and draft a public transition policy for moving from fossil fuels to renewables.” POLICIES In interviews with the FT and The Herald , Tom McKillop claims climate credit for financing renewables, while refusing to accept that RBS derives climate responsibility for financing fossil fuels. RBS continues to lag behind its competitors in recognizing the impacts of its loans:


Bank of America, RBS’ competitor for LaSalle, has not only admitted responsibility, but committed to reducing the embedded emissions resulting from its loans to energy and utilities companies by 7% by 2008. 
HSBC recognizes that “its most significant impact  is the investment and lending decisions we make. 


HBOS have said “Tackling climate change will hinge on the investment decisions made by institutional investors. HSBC, HBOS and Barclays are members of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC), RBS is not. 

The bank continues to promote itself publically as an ""oil & gas bank"". Bronwen Thomas of national student network People & Planet said “We are calling on RBS to accept responsibility for the climate impacts of its lending. Climate change is and will remain one of the biggest issues amongst students. If RBS remains “The Oil & Gas Bank” in deed if not in name, this will impact heavily on its image amongst young people.""ENGAGEMENT Tom McKillop’s quotes in Wednesday’s Financial Times, which accompanied the launch of RBS’ 2006 CSR report, were highly vitriolic and critical of the NGO report “The Oil & Gas Bank – RBS and the financing of climate change”.  This followed extensive efforts by the NGOs to engage with the bank in a fair and accountable manner. Mika Minio of PLATFORM said “After RBS’ PR team opportunistically resorted to climate denial in March, it’s ironic that McKillop is accusing us of ‘bad science’. McKillop’s attack on us seriously misrepresents our report – I’m wondering whether he even read it.”------- http://www.rbs.com/content/corporate_responsibility/downloads/2006_CR_report.pdf

Jakarta, Amsterdam ",World’s biggest palm oil trader responsible for illegal logging and violating Human Rights,,,Wilmar International ,agriculture - palm oil ,Singapore,"
Wilmar, the world’s biggest trader in palm oil, is illegally logging rainforests, setting forests on fire and violating the rights of local communities in Indonesia, according to a new report published today by Friends of the Earth Netherlands.  Paul de Clerck, Corporates Campaigner at Friends of the Earth International, said: “This report reveals that Indonesian palm oil traded by Wilmar is scandalous and damaging the environment. Forests are being cut and burnt down illegally, Indonesian laws are being broken and local people are suffering.”Europe is one of the world’s biggest palm oil importers, with palm oil used as an ingredient in many food products and cosmetics, and increasingly as a biofuel. Wilmar supplies multinational companies such as Unilever, Nestle and Cargill.Rully Syumanda, Forest Campaigner at Friends of the Earth Indonesia / WALHI said “Europe's growing demand for palm oil is leading to environmental and social devastation”.The palm oil industry has attempted to market the trade as environmentally and socially sustainable, but this report exposes these policies as hollow and inadequate. Singapore-based multinational Wilmar is a member of the industry-led Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and is funded by the World Bank’s private arm as well as private European banks which have codes of conduct against unsustainable palm oil. Rabobank and Standard Chartered Bank are the main European financers.Anne van Schaik of Friends of the Earth Netherlands said: “Rabobank apparently has a code of conduct for financing palm oil, but absurdly this doesn’t apply to the handful of general loans that the bank gives to Wilmar. The code of conduct is therefore meaningless – boosting Rabobank’s image but doing nothing to protect against illegal deforestation.”Milieudefensie and two Indonesian non-profit organisations investigated  three plantations of Wilmar International Ltd. on West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Specifically, the report reveals:

The Indonesian authorities are suing Wilmar for intentional and systematic illegal burning of forests to clear land for plantations;


Wilmar has violated an Indonesian law that requires approval of the Environmental Impact Assessment before palm oil development begins;
Wilmar is clearing forest beyond its allocated borders and without the legally required permits;
Wilmar has cleared areas of forest that local communities have customary rights to, without even consulting them.

Friends of the Earth Netherlands (Milieudefensie) has filed complaints to the Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil and to the private arm of the World Bank – the International Finance Corporation.

United States of America ",Sakhalin II: new environmental violations brought to light,BNP Paribas ,France,Sakhalin II oil and gas project ,oil and gas,Russian Federation,"
Fifteen Russian and international environmental organi- zations sent a letter today to leading public and private banks documenting extensive new environmental violations on the controversial Sakhalin II oil and gas project in Russia. These include the project’s continued refusal to follow the recommendations of an expert scientific  panel commissioned by project sponsors to review impacts on the critically endangered Western Gray Whale; failure to protect wild salmons spawning rivers from massive erosion and construction across geologically unstable zones; and the unwillingness of project sponsors to publicly disclose draft oil spill response plans for citizen input. Banks receiving the letter include the export credit agencies of the UK, Japan and US, and private bank including RBS, BNP Paribas, Mizuho, SMBC, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, and others. Campaigners have targeted these international financing of Sakhalin II for years due to the project’s severe environmental and social impacts including the threat of extinction to the critically endangered Western Gray Whale; harm to hundreds of wild salmon runs; long-term damage to Sakhalin’s and Hokkaido Japan’s fishing communities through construction impacts and potential catastrophic oil spills; and other socio-economic and health impacts. Sakhalin II gained widespread international attention in December 2006, when the Russian government-controlled Gazprom assumed a controlling share in the project following six months of pressure from Russian environmental regulators. For five years prior these events, Sakhalin II failed to secure international public and private financing due to the project’s inability to comply with these banks’ environmental policies. Violations identified by these banks paralleled those identified by Russian regulators. Today, Royal Dutch Shell continues to fill most senior management positions and is still responsible for construction and environmental management. “Be it before, during or after the Gazprom takeover, Sakhalin II has never been close to complying with Russian law, international best practice, and the policies of public and private banks that are considering financing for the project,” said Dmitry Lisitsyn, Chairman of the Sakhalin Island-based Sakhalin Environment Watch. “Its unfathomable that any public or private bank would still consider financing for Sakhalin II. With the project 85% built, many of Sakhalin II’s most serious violations are permanent and irreversible, hence the project will never comply with these banks’ environmental policies” said Doug Norlen, Policy Director, Pacific Environment. The groups’ letter takes aim at ABN Amro, which reportedly provided $1 billion of financing for Gazprom’s purchase of a controlling share of Sakhalin II, despite ABN’s status as a founder of the Equator Principles on environmental and social performance. “By financing Sakhalin II, ABN Amro circumvented the Equator Principles and undercut environmentally responsible banks that have thus far refrained from financing the project,” said Paul de Clerck, Corporate Campaign Coordinator, Friends of the Earth International. The letter comes one week after Sakhalin II Project Director, David Greer, resigned in disgrace after the widely publicized leak of his “motivational memo,” which plagiarized General George Patton and inferred that there are cowards within the employees’ ranks who lack confidence in their ability to continue effectively on the crisis-prone project. Letters analogous to this letter have been sent to the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, US Export-Import Bank, RBS, BNP Paribas, Mizuho, SMBC, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, and others. For further information also visit the dodgy deals site of Sakhalin II. At a cost of over USD 20 billion, Sakhalin II is said by project  sponsors to be the largest integrated oil and gas project in the world.  The project operator, Sakhalin Energy Investment Company, Ltd., consists of Gazprom, Royal Dutch Shell, Mitsui and Mitsubishi.

Brussels Belgium, Jakarta Indonesia ",Major international banks finance catastrophic mud volcano,Barclays ,United Kingdom,,,,"
Major international banks such as Credit Suisse, Barclays, Fortis Group, Merrill Lynch & Co. and Natixis are injecting hundreds of millions of Euros into a set of companies responsible for a catastrophic mud volcano in Indonesia, Friends of the Earth International/ Europe has revealed in two new reports launched today. Toxic mud has been gushing from the ground in Sidoarjo, Indonesia since May 2006, following drilling operations by the company Lapindo Brantas Inc.  Friends of the Earth International has demanded that the international banks withhold any further financing from Lapindo Brantas Inc until the company pays compensation for the damage from the disaster. Lapindo Brantas has so far failed to restore the damaged area or compensate the vast majority of the 3,500 families who have been forced from their homes.   Paul de Clerck, corporate campaigner of Friends of the Earth International, said: ""Funding from international banks like Credit Suisse and Fortis enabled Lapindo to start their gas exploration. Now the banks must accept their role in the disastrous mudflow created by the drilling. Any new loan from the banks should be conditional on Lapindo paying compensation for all the damage it has caused in Sidoarjo.""  Since May 29, 2006, when the mud flow started, more than 15,000 people have been affected, 600 hectares of land including 11 villages have been submerged and farmland, road and rail tracks destroyed. At least 8 people have been killed in a large gas pipeline explosion related to the mud flow and the livelihoods of tens of thousands of people have been destroyed.  So far all efforts to stop the mud flow have failed and the catastrophic situation of the mudflow victims remains unresolved. The Indonesian government has ordered Lapindo to pay US$ 435 million in compensation to victims and for efforts to halt the mud. But Lapindo is shirking its responsibility for the enormous damage it has created. It denies causing the mud flow and argues that the compensation costs are too high. A year after the mud began to flow, Lapindo has only paid partial compensation to a small number of victims. The Indonesian company Energi Mega Persada, owning 50% of the Brantas Production Sharing Contract, has tried to dodge its liability several times by selling its assets to dubious overseas companies. Fortunately, these efforts were stopped by the Indonesian government.  Farah Sofa from Friends of the Earth Indonesia / WALHI said: Lapindo Brantas tries to claim that the mudflow in Sidoarj Indonesia, is a natural disaster, but this is not true. Numerous experts have judged that the incident is a direct consequence of Lapindo Brantas irresponsible actions"".As outlined in the reports by Friends of the Earth International, Credit Suisse, Barclays, Merrill Lynch, Natixis and Fortis  have provided loans of several hundreds of millions of Euros to Energi Mega Persada (Indonesia), PT Medco E&P Brantas (Indonesia) and Santos (Australia), the three companies owning Lapindo Brantas Inc. Without this financial support, Lapindo would not have been able to explore the gas field in Sidoarjo. Friends of the Earth, Banktrack and Berne Declaration have addressed the banks with their responsibility and urged them to take steps to guarantee that Lapindo pays all costs related to restoration and compensation .  Barclays, Merrill Lynch and Natixis did not respond at all. Credit Suisse, the bank that has provided the largest loans, said that they expect Lapindo to take its responsibility. But since May 2006 Credit Suisse has provided a new loan of US$ 126 million to Energi Mega Persada without inserting conditions to ensure that Lapindo actually pays for the damage they caused.   Fortis has refused to take any responsibility or to take up the issue any further because it doesn’t finance the Brantas project itself. Friends of the Earth insists that Fortis does indeed have a responsibility as it finances two of the three owners of the Brantas Production Sharing Contract, the agreement under which the gas exploration is taking place. Fortis Bank is an important creditor and provides financial services to the companies. "

Amsterdam ",Milieudefensie publishes Climate Performance Index 2007 of Dutch Banks,ABN AMRO ,Netherlands,,,,"
Investments by Dutch banks cause more than three times the total CO2 emissions that the Netherlands emit annually. Dutch banks invest over twenty times more in projects that harm the climate such as oil extraction and coal-fired plants, than in projects for climate friendly renewable energy. ABN AMRO is the worst performing Dutch bank with the biggest climate impact. These are the findings of a Friends of the Earth Netherlands (Milieudefensie) report published today. With the slogan “Climate Change? Not with my money!”, the environmental organisation is calling on consumers to switch to a climate friendly bank.Milieudefensie has launched the website, www.nietmetmijngeld.nl (“not with my money”), calling for climate conscious banking. “Banks have an enormous climate impact. Their investments in fossil fuels cause 594 million tonnes of greenhouse gas CO2 emissions. This is more than three times the amount that the Netherlands emits in a year,“ says Donald Pols of Friends of the Earth Netherlands.  “The 6.9 billion euros that banks invest in renewable energy are peanuts compared to the 118 billion euros that they invest in fossil fuels.” The banks are not very open about the impact of their investments on the climate. Milieudefensie's report is the first overview to date comparing these investments. Customers can reduce their CO2 substantially by choosing a climate conscious bank. “For example, an ABN AMRO customer who transfers 2,000 euros from their savings account to the Rabobank, reduces just as much  CO2  as they would by replacing all their incandescent light bulbs with energy saving ones. If they were to transfer 10,000 euros from the ABN AMRO to the Triodos Bank or the ASN Bank they would save as much CO2 as not driving their car for half a year.  On the website, consumers can check the amount of CO2 emissions a bank causes with their savings. Customers can send an e-mail to their bank or order an infopack on how to switch to a climate conscious bank. “We hope large numbers of consumers and organisations will join in this action”, says Pols.ASN Bank and Triodos Bank are the most climate friendly banks in the Netherlands. “Other banks should follow their example and reduce their investments in dirty fossil fuels. We must invest more in energy efficiency and renewables,” adds Donald Pols. He concludes: “It is all hands on deck to save the climate now. Influential actors like banks have a special responsibility to take action and start investing in solutions to climate change.”Members of Parliament will ask questions to the Dutch government about the findings of the report this Monday.

Europe ",Europe-wide Protests against BNP Paribas,BNP Paribas ,France,Belene nuclear power plant ,energy plants - nuclear,Bulgaria,"

On June 5, World Environment Day, environmental organizations in 15 countries protested against the French bank BNP Paribas, because of its involvement in the Belene Nuclear Power Project (NPP) in Bulgaria. BNP Paribas is providing a 250 Million Euro loan for the construction of two nuclear reactors of Russian design in Belene. It is the first western bank to become involved in this controversial project.  Environmental NGOs prosteded in Vienna, Paris, Sofia, Bucharest, Rome, Budapest, Amsterdam, Brussels and other European capitals. They picketed BNP Paribas’ offices with leaflets, banners and placards asking the bank to leave the project. 
The Belene Project is situated in an earthquake area in Northern  Bulgaria, close to the Romanian border. During the last large earthquake in 1977, 120 people died just 14 km from the project site. The plan to build an NPP here goes back to Soviet times. Belene was conceived in the early 1980s and construction began in 1985, shortly before the catastrophe of Chernobyl took place. Popular protests and a study by the Bulgarian  Academy of Sciences, which warned against erecting nuclear reactors in this area, led to a halt in construction and in the 1990s the project was officially scrapped. The Bulgarian Cabinet deemed Belene to be “technically unsafe and economically not viable”. 
In 2004, however, the Bulgarian Government decided to re-start the plan to build two nuclear reactors in Belene. And in 2006, it awarded a construction contract to the Russian firm AtomStroyExport, which put forward a bid in cooperation with the French-German company Areva NP. The reactors planned in Belene are of a new Russian design, for which no safety assessment exists and which has never before been built in Europe. “We do not want to become a testing ground for the Russian nuclear industry’s projects”, says Petko Kovatchev from BeleNE!, the Bulgarian NGO Coalition opposing the NPP.But not only NGOs are critical of the project. Until today, eleven international banks have refused to finance Belene. Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank, UniCredit, Société Géneral, Citibank, Credit Suisse and others turned down the project as too risky and too controversial. “BNP Paribas, however, seems to have less scruples than other banks”, says Sebastian Godinot, from the French organization Les Amis de la Terre. “Financing a project like Belene means risking a second Chernobyl”. “If BNP Paribas goes ahead with financing Belene, they will see enormous backlash”, says Heffa Schücking of the German NGO Urgewald. “BNP Paribas reaps the bulk of its profits in Europe, where the majority of the population is opposed to an expansion of nuclear power. For a bank, which is trying to expand its retail business and to increase its share of institutional investors, financing Belene is a bad move”, she adds.
“Building an unknown type of nuclear reactor in an earthquake area is a recipe for disaster and puts the people of Bulgaria, Romania, Macedonia, Serbia and other countries in the region at great risk”, says Jan Haverkamp of Greenpeace. Several months ago, over 160 NGOs from 28 countries wrote to BNP Paribas and expressed their concerns about Belene. “The bank did not even see fit to answer this letter”, states Haverkamp.

Utrecht, Netherlands ",Banks to stay out of Ilisu Dam Project,Société Générale ,France,Ilisu dam ,energy plants - dams,Turkey,"
Commercial banks today were warned not to become involved in investing or financing the controversial Ilisu Dam project located in Turkey. BankTrack, a network of 17 international NGOs in collaboration with civil society organisations WEED (Germany), ECAWatch (Austria), the Berne Declaration (Switzerland), Amis de la Terre (France), and The Corner House (UK) sent letters to major international banks outlining massive stakeholder opposition to construction of the dam and the failure of the project developers and supporting Export Credit Agencies to meet international standards. The groups warn that commercial banks will face extensive reputational risks if they become involved in the project.   A total of 78 000 people, the majority of them Kurds, would be affected by the construction and operation of the dam. However for communities facing relocation as a result of flooded river valleys, the proposed resettlement plans fall well short of minimum international standards required for large-scale development projects of this type. The NGO letter alerts potential financiers to ongoing litigation within Turkey and at the European Court of Human Rights, and to current legal advice pointing to liability of other financial institutions providing finance for facilitating breaches of international law.  The letter was sent to Société Générale (France), Bank Austria and Zürcher Kantonalbank (Switzerland), which are currently known to consider involvement in the project. A similar letter was released to the wider banking community requesting potential investors to take note of the many serious problems that still remain unaddressed by project sponsors.   “Individual banks were warned that if investment were to take place, they would not escape responsibility owed to project affected communities, the banks’ shareholders and the public at large, even by hiding behind a consortium and ECAs” commented Heike Drillisch from BankTrack member group WEED in Germany.   BankTrack advised the banks that ECA contracts have not yet been signed for the project and the Turkish authorities are showing great reluctance to actually commit to fulfilling conditions tied to ECA approval. Further, the faulty environmental assessment and resettlement planning, doubts over the project's compatibility with international law, and widespread community opposition to the project should be enough for any responsible financial institution to refrain from involvement in Ilisu.

San Fransisco, Utrecht ",Chinese banks need to catch up on environmental policies,Agricultural Bank of  ,China,,,,"
A new report released today by BankTrack, the international NGO network monitoring the financial sector, and Friends of the Earth US, finds that only two of China’s ten most important banks -- China Development Bank (CDB) and the Export-Import Bank of China (Chexim) -- have publicly-disclosed environmental policies. Both banks’ policies fall short of international best practice, while the rest of the banks surveyed had no publicly-available environmental financing standards.     With this report, BankTrack aims to fill a gap in public knowledge on the environmental policies of Chinese banks. China’s financial institutions have long played a key role in bankrolling industrial development in within China, and today they are also becoming important players in financing environmentally and socially sensitive activities around the world. ""By adopting world-class environmental financing standards, Chinese banks can play an important role in advancing sustainability on a global level"", said Johan Frijns, coordinator of BankTrack; ""Otherwise, they threaten to drag down whatever progress that has been made in developing such standards for the international banking sector""Focus on legal compliance The report, titled ""Time to Go Green; Environmental Responsibility in the Chinese Banking Sector"", concluded that environmental financing policies at Chinese banks focus mainly on ensuring the clients obey environmental laws, and thus lag far behind those of international banks. The report includes examples of several environmentally and socially sensitive transactions financed by Chinese banks, such as China National Machinery Equipment Import-Export Corp.' Kiani Kertas pulp mill in Indonesia.   However, the report also points to some encouraging signs that Beijing is beginning to stimulate banks to pay more attention to environmental matters. For example, the Peoples' Bank of China has recently developed a new credit database which includes borrowers’ environmental compliance data. This will allow Chinese banks to evaluate how well companies have followed environmental laws before offering loans.Finally, the report shows that many international banks, who own significant shares of Chinese banks, have the ability to institute world-class environmental standards through their strategic investment agreements.  ""International banks have complained that the lack of environmental financing standards at Chinese peers is putting them at a competitive disadvantage"" said Friends of the Earth-US Michelle Chan-Fishel, who authored the report. ""But banks like HSBC, RBS, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America all own large shares in Chinese banks. They must take responsibility for ensuring that high environmental standards, which they all claim to have, are also adopted by their strategic business partners""  Secrecy prohibits proper assessment None of the commercial banks in the study had publicly-disclosed environmental policies, and a key challenge in writing the report was Chinese banks’ lack of transparency. For example, Chexims' environmental policy was only released in late April 2007, in response to a request by Pacific Environment, a BankTrack member group.  ""lack of transparency and public participation mechanisms are two fundamental deficiencies which put them far behind their international peers"", said Doug Norlen of Pacific Environment. ""In the last several years, almost all of the world’s other public and private banks which have adopted leading environmental standards have done so in consultation with civil society.""  Implementation unclear The report also raised questions about how well banks’ stated environmental policies are being implemented, a problem which also plagues the Equator Principles, a voluntary initiative of banks on project finance, as well as individual banks that have adopted their own standards. For example, CDB’s policy summary states that it only finances deals included in an approved project list published by China’s State Environmental Protection Agency. But given CDB’s rapidly expanding overseas profile, it is unclear how the bank ensures regulatory compliance in its clients’ overseas activities.   Similarly, implementation questions also apply to the Export-Import Bank of China, whose environmental policy includes vague language preventing it from financing projects which create unacceptable environmental damage. For example, the Ramu nickel mine in Papua New Guinea, financed by both CDB and Chexim, proposes to use the controversial practice of submarine tailings disposal as a mechanism for disposing of toxic mine waste.  ""The proposal to utilise submarine tailings disposal at this mine site has been discredited by independent scientific studies"", said Techa Beaumont of Mineral Policy Institute. ""The use of this practice, particularly in a region known for upwelling currents that can bring these toxic wastes to the surface, poses significant environmental harm that could lead to violations of Chexim environmental policies.""There is little indication that adequate environmental assessment and monitoring has been done, despite commitments in Chexim’s environmental policy to enhance these aspects of project development.  The report also includes a case study on the Chexim-financed Merowe dam in Sudan, a project which is indicative of the bank’s new role as a key financier of infrastructure projects in poor countries.   ""China Exim bank should avoid the mistakes that Western financial institutions have made, and address environmental and governance concerns in its lending decisions"", said Peter Bosshard of International Rivers Network. ""Projects such as the Merowe Dam in Sudan, which destroy the environment and impoverish affected people, will not bring about sustainable development, and will squander the great opportunity which China's new role presents.""   The banks covered in this report include: Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China, China Development Bank, China Export-Import Bank, China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure), Agricultural Development Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and China CITIC Group (China CITIC Bank).

Quito, Ecuador and Washington DC ",Oil development proposal violates international standards,,,"Block 31,  Yasuni National Park ",oil and gas,Ecuador,"
Scientists and  conservationists from thirteen countries have urged President Correa of  Ecuador, his Energy and Environment Ministers, Alberto Acosta and Ana  Alban, and ten international banks to reconsider Brazilian oil company  Petrobras’ current plan for oil drilling in Block 31, which encompasses  key areas of Yasuní National Park. Yasuni is the crown jewel of the  Ecuadorian mainland national park system. This park is an area of unique  biological and scientific importance in the core of a UNESCO Biosphere  Reserve, and is adjacent to territories for indigenous peoples living in  voluntary isolation which have been decreed to be untouchable.  In a nation-wide radio broadcast on February 3, President Correa said  the government would suspend the contracts of oil companies that  needlessly damage the environment. However, the Environmental Assessment  (EA) of the current Petrobras project violates major requirements of  accepted international good practice as well as the Equator Principles –  a commitment by the world’s leading international private banks and  investment companies not to finance large projects in the developing  world if they do not meet key environmental and social standards of the  World Bank's International Finance Corporation (IFC).  An international alliance of 43 scientists from Ecuador, North America  and Europe has proposed several critical, feasible design alternatives  that would mitigate many of these risks and impacts. Of particular  concern is the explicit acknowledgment in the EA that there is a  substantial, ""probable"" risk that Waorani and Kichwa indigenous  communities affected by the project will engage in physical protests and  interventions that could lead to work stoppages and violence. There is  also the inherent risk that the processing plant to be built near the  Tiputini River on the northern border of the Park could have a  catastrophic oil spill.  Continuation of the project without incorporating the proposed  alternatives will have broad direct and secondary environmental and  social impacts and will likely lead to major cultural changes among the  indigenous communities in the region. Specifically, environmental  impacts include deforestation, over-hunting, and pollution. Any  contamination or pollution will be particularly damaging to the Tiputini  River, home to rare mammals such as the globally endangered Giant Otter  (Pteronura brasiliensis), the globally vulnerable (and in Ecuador  critically endangered) Amazonian Manatee (Trichechus inunguis), the  globally vulnerable (and in Ecuador endangered) Pink River Dolphin (Inia  geoffrensis), and the Gray River Dolphin (Sotalia fluviatilis), which is  also endangered in Ecuador.  The project will also increase pressures on the indigenous communities  living in voluntary isolation adjacent to Block 31. Forced contact and  dependency with society and a serious threat of extermination could lead  to more acute cycles of internal and external tribal war and irreparable  damage to these peoples.

The Hague ",ABN AMRO Financing for Sakhalin II Poses Huge Risk for Potential Buyers,ABN AMRO ,Netherlands,Sakhalin II oil and gas project ,oil and gas,Russian Federation,"

As ABN Amro shareholders decide today on the future of the bank, whether to be taken over by Barclays or dissected by an RBS-led consortium,  recent financing of Russia's controversial Sakhalin II oil and gas project will sully the environmental reputation of whichever bank that ends up buying it.  
On Tuesday, April 24, 2007, The Moscow Times reported that ABN AMRO Holding and Societe Generale provided US$ 1 billion each to the Russian government controlled gas giant, Gazprom, for its purchase of a controlling share of Sakhalin II.   ABN AMRO's financing of Sakhalin II is grossly inconsistent with its status as a founding signatory of the Equator Principles on environmental and social performance. Sakhalin II threatens critically endangered Western Gray Whales, hundreds of wild salmon rivers, and fishing communities.Sakhalin II also brought thousands of introduced workers to Sakhalin Island, resulting in hyper inflation in housing costs, increased violence and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. Both Barclays and RBS have adopted the Equator Principles.  ""All banks involved in the Great Game around ABN want it both ways; but they can't claim to be environmental leaders while taking over the financing of one of the most ecologically and socially destructive oil and gas projects in the world"", said Dmitry Lisitsyn, Chairman of the Sakhalin Island-based Sakhalin Environment Watch.  ABN AMRO and Barclays' association with Sakhalin II will be particularly embarrassing as both attempt to defend their spot on the ""short list"" of the Financial Times' and International Finance Corporation's (IFC's) upcoming ""Sustainable Bank of the Year Award"" and Sustainable Energy Deal of the Year Award"", respectively.  ""The Financial Times and IFC have their own reputations at stake here. ABN AMRO's and Barclay's association with Sakhalin II will be a credibility drag on the whole lot of them""; said Johan Frijns, Coordinator of BankTrack.ABN AMRO financing of the project may create a furor among fellow Western bankers who last year sharply criticized Russia's apparent expropriation of Sakhalin II and nationalization of the project operator, Sakhalin Energy Investment Company.  ""ABN AMRO financing of the Sakhalin-II project condones Russia's nationalistic energy policy and Putin's heavy-handed tactics"", said Doug Norlen, Policy Director, Pacific Environment.  What's more, the bank consortium that ends up inheriting the Sakhalin II deal will be entering a project with chronic and severe unresolved environmental problems and associated risks. Despite a recent agreement with SEIC shareholders over Gazprom's entry into the project, the Russian Government has repeatedly and publicly recognized many times that the project is still not in compliance with Russian Law.  ""The Russian governments' ongoing confirmation that Sakhalin II violates the law is reinforced by what environmental organizations have documented for years through independent monitoring of the project, and what EBRD has also documented prior to its withdrawal""said Lisitsyn.  http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2007/04/23/061.html: Gazprom Raises $2Bln Loan Gazprom raised $2 billion in syndicated loans to help pay for a controlling stake in Shell's Sakhalin-2 project, Interfax reported Friday, citing an unidentified banker. Two loans of $1 billion each were organized by Societe Generale and ABN AMRO Holding, Interfax reported. Gazprom needs the money to pay $7.45 billion for a controlling 50 percent plus one share stake in the Sakhalin-2 project, Interfax said. (Bloomberg) The Equator Principles are a set of globally recognized private bank guidelines established to assess and manage social and environmental risk in project financing. According to ABN AMRO's website, the bank ""played a leading role in the drafting and subsequent adoption of the Equator Principles by a number of banks"" http://www.abnAMRO.com/com/about/sd/sd_policies.jsp   As a result of these severe environmental problems Sakhalin II tried for three years and ultimately failed to win the environmental approval of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). In December 2006 the EBRD withdrew the project from its consideration.   Sakhalin Energy Investment Company (SEIC) was previously comprised of Royal Dutch Shell (55%), Mitsui (25%) and Mitsubishi (25%). Under the terms of the Gazprom takeover, the Russian government-controlled gas company will have a controlling 51% share, and the other shareholders will dilute their shares by half. "

Only three months after adopting the Equator Principles, ANZ Bank of Australia is risking violations to the well-established principles of global project finance through its involvement in the controversial Gunns pulp mill proposed for the Tamar Valley in northern Tasmania. 
Gunns Ltd, the Tasmanian company responsible for clear felling large areas of Tasmania’s high conservation-value old-growth forests, last week withdrew the pulp mill from the established environmental and social assessment and approval process. New legislation currently before the Tasmanian parliament is now the only way by which Gunns can have the pulp mill approved, bypassing Tamania’s regular procedure. The bill, introduced by Premier Paul Lennon, proposes to bypass the environmental and social review procedures and exterminate both the public’s right to participate and appeal decisions, rights which are fundamental tenets of the Equator Principles. 
 
In an open letter sent to ANZ CEO John MacFarlane by BankTrack, ANZ’s client Gunns is identified as being unwilling to submit its project to current legal standards, leaving as its only option for approval the hurriedly introduced bill which lowers project standards below that of the Equator Principles. These banking principles are based on World Bank’s baseline standards for projects which cover developing and third world countries. ANZ’s implicit approval of the project by continuing involvement with Gunns mocks the bank’s commitments to the Principles. 
ANZ has been tight-lipped and non-transparent on its involvement in the project, refusing to answer BankTrack’s requests for clarification on its ongoing involvement. David Barnden from BankTrack’s Human Rights Program comments: 
‘This is a clear cut case where ANZ must apply the Equator Principles in its assessment of Gunns’ mill. ANZ has an obligation to its shareholders, clients, other Equator Principle Financial Institutions, and project affected communities to adhere to the standards set by the EPs. If ANZ doesn’t pull out, the bank may face reputational and potential legal risks for choosing profits over sound procedure.' 
BankTrack advises ANZ to assure itself that it would not be held liable for legal obligations arising from violations of the Equator Principles, and also said that ANZ should take care to avoid exposure to joint liability with sponsors and other lead facilitators in the event of civil lawsuits. BankTrack requests that ANZ publicly withdraw from any potential involvement in the project.

ANZ’s questionable lending practices have also placed it in the international spotlight over involvement with an environmentally unsound mining venture in the Philippines’ Island of Rapu Rapu.

Utrecht ",Who has adopted the Equator Principles?,Banco Galicia ,Argentina,,,,"
The Equator Principle Secretariat is unaware just exactly which banks have adopted the Equator Principles. Mizuho Bank, an Equator Principle Financial Institution since October 2003 and now hosting the EP Secretariat has no knowledge of the latest two banks that claim to have signed up to the principles.  Respected business website INFOBAE informs that Banco Galicia of Argentina became a signatory to the EPs on March 19. The Buenos Aires based news service reveals Banco will adhere to the Equator Principles, making it the first Equator Principle Financial Institution (EPFI) from Argentina, and the first from
Latin America’s Southern Cone. Banco Galicia is quoted as saying it will apply the Equator Principles to project finance of AR$15 million, equivalent to US$5m or half of minimum amount of investment suggested by the principles. Despite press and civil society being aware of Banco Galicia ’s Equator Principle commitments the EP secretariat is none the wiser.Three weeks ago, Sweden’s Nordea Bank confirmed to a Danish journalist investigating the bank’s involvement in Botnia’s controversial pulp mill in that it had adopted the Equator Principles.When asked by BankTrack to confirm whether or not Nordea and Banco Galicia were EPFIs, the Equator Principle Secretariat replied:‘Nordea Bank and Banco Galicia both have not signed on to the Equator Principles. They are not Equator Principles Financial Institutions (EPFIs). Once they adopt, we're sure to provide you with their adopting information on the Equator Principles website.’BankTrack called Nordea on the 21 of March and was informed by the bank’s compliance department that it had adopted the Equator Principles one month ago, adhering as of 21 February 2007. Nordea told BankTrack it had not yet advised the EP secretariat due to an administrative delay.Nordea Bank also faces accusations of violating the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises for financing Botnia’s pulp mill in after it replaced fellow Equator Principle signatory ING Group as lead arranger for the project. BankTrack member group CEDHA will present the complaint in front of the OECD in 
Stockholm tomorrow.Confusion surrounding the process to sign on the Equator Principles is part of a wider problem of implementation and accountability of the Principles, which are considered the flagship standards for private financers, benchmarking environmental and social performance of multi-million dollar projects throughout the world.Implementation of the Principles is left entirely to the discretion of the EPFI itself. David Barnden, the coordinator of BankTrack’s Human Rights program, comments:‘The Equator Principles cannot be enforced, and there is no mechanism to judge or confirm compliance. More importantly, the Equator Principles lack procedures for stakeholders to bring complaints to the multinational banks investing capital and reaping profits from projects which pose serious threats to local communities and the environment.’ "

London ",The Oil & Gas Bank,Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS)  ,United Kingdom,,,,"
The Royal Bank of Scotland is covering up involvement in carbon emissions greater than those of the whole country of Scotland, according to new research published today, Monday 12 March 2007. The report “The Oil & Gas Bank” reveals the extent to which RBS-NatWest is providing the financial fuel driving climate change. Publicly promoting itself as ""The Oil & Gas Bank"", RBS provides oil corporations with the cash to build and operate drilling rigs, pipelines and oil tankers in some of the world’s most sensitive and unstable places. Bank loans play a key role in forcing open the new carbon frontier. RBS has financed oil projects in Nigeria, Angola and Ecuador that cause environmental destruction, disruption of indigenous peoples and increase conflict. Johan Frijns of BankTrack stated “Identifying itself so brazenly with fossil fuels carries major reputational risks for RBS. The self-assigned title “The Oil & Gas Bank” could soon become a liability rather than a badge of success.”Mika Minio-Paluello of PLATFORM and the report’s lead author said ""RBS-NatWest is locking vast emissions into our collective future. By identifying itself as “the Oil & Gas Bank”, RBS is brazenly embarking on a destructive binge with potentially devastating consequences for the planet.”The report exposes the degree to which just one part of UK plc is fuelling climate change, and undermining efforts to reduce concentrations of carbon in the atmosphere. By financing vast oil and gas projects, RBS loans lead to carbon emissions “embedded” in the activities of the fossil fuel sectors that tower above the bank’s direct, publicly disclosed carbon emissions that stem from its building use or business travel.

The emissions embedded within RBS project finance to oil and gas projects reached 36.9 million tonnes in 2005, equivalent to those of a quarter of all UK homes (6.2 million)


Yet RBS reported 2005 emissions as only 318,000 tonnes in its Corporate Responsibility Report – less than one hundredth of the 36.9 million tonnes RBS was responsible for through its financing of new oil and gas projects. 


Provisional figures for 2006 already show that RBS annual emissions are greater than Scotland’s. 

Bronwen Thomas of national student network People & Planet said “Climate change is a massive issue amongst students, as big as apartheid was in the 1980s. Students are concerned that by opening NatWest accounts they will help push the atmosphere past its tipping point. Soon the Oil & Gas Bank might find their young customers switching to more climate-friendly alternatives.”Andrew Simms, policy director of nef (the new economics foundation) said “At a time when the whole world is waking up to the reality of climate change, RBS is behaving like a corporate fossil. By aggressively pursuing a policy that squeezes the last drops of oil from the most sensitive and volatile regions on earth, they are helping to send us all in the direction of the dinosaurs.”Duncan McLaren, Chief Executive of Friends of the Earth Scotland said "" Through its investments, Scotland's leading bank has been unmasked for helping to fuel climate change. The polluting emissions RBS are responsible for are on course to even dwarf that of Scotland as a nation. It's time for RBS to stop profiting from pollution. "

Paris, France ","New report FoE France : French Banks, Fossil Banks?",Belfius ,Belgium,Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline ,oil and gas,Azerbaijan,"

Les Amis de la Terre today releases the report « French banks, Fossil banks? » (French version). the report estimates, for the first time in France, the French banks' indirect greenhouse gas emissions and underlines the lack of credible energy and climate policies. The report relies on the best international practices and points out the obvious lagging behind  by French banks. Les Amis de la Terre provides them with clear recommendations. The report's release is accompanied with an eco-citizen guide : «Environment : How do I choose my bank ?» aimed towards the general public.

The «French banks, Fossil banks ?» report gives grades, on the basis of a strict methodology, to the energy and climate policies of the ten major French banks. It follows the « French banks: save the climate ! » campaign, launched in 2005, which pointed out the impact of French banks' indirect greenhouse gas emissions which are equal to 3,2 times the global emissions of France! Even though banks have major responsibilities with regard to climate, not a single one of the French banks has yet established a risk-reducing policy. Abroad though, several large banks (Bank of America and JPMorganChase – United States, ABN AMRO - Netherlands, HSBC – United Kingdom) have already established much more ambitious policies.Sébastien Godinot, responsible for the Finance campaign at Les Amis de la Terre, explains : «From the beginning of the climate campaign, banks have developed lending products to encourage retail clients to renovate and insulate housing, the second largest greenhouse gas emitting sector in France. The campaign has been a success, and the banks show how quickly they can react. While today the evidence of the seriousness of climate change is mounting (Stern Report, GIEC, etc.), banks must now go into top gear and pitch in to confront their indirect emissions, produced by the projects and companies they finance. It is time for French banks to have their climate and energy revolution. »Indeed, the report's results are negative: none of the banks reach even an average grade. Crédit Coopératif and Dexia get an acceptable note, followed by Groupe Banque Populaire. All the others banks are laggards. Société Générale and Crédit Mutuel seem even bored with environmental aspects.French banks are financing polluting fossil fuel projects ten times more than renewable energies. They all brag about sustainable development, though they are still financing contentious energy projects like the  Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline from the Caspian Sea (Banque Populaire, BNP-Paribas, Crédit Agricole, Dexia, Société Générale). While industries are now subjected to emissions quota, banks take advantage of the lack of  restriction in their financing choices to rake in astronomical profits.Citizens, as majors economic actors are called to take action toward better banking practices : « The guide «Environment : how do I choose my bank ?», published at the same time as the report, ranks the French banks according to their respect for the environment. Citizens don't know how their money is used when they commit to their bank, though they are aware how their choices can affect society. We will distribute the guide widely and ask customers-citizens either to push for their bank to improve or to switch to an ecologically better bank » explains Déborah Lambert-Perez from Les Amis de la Terre.The two documents are in French. A summary in English is available on the BankTrack website.

Brussels ",Sixty-eight banks fuelling cluster munition producers with billions of dollars,KBC ,Belgium,,,,"
Today Netwerk Vlaanderen launches its new briefing paper ‘Explosive Investments’ revealing the results of its research into the financing of six cluster munition producers like Lockheed Martin, Thales and Raytheon. Sixty-eight financial institutions have been found to play a role in the financing of these companies. International Banks InvolvedFinancial flows have reached these companies from all over the world. The research contains information on financial institutions from Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Switzerland, The Netherlands, UK and USA. Together they secured credit facilities for these six cluster munition producers worth a total amount of US$ 12.6 billion (€ 10 billion) during 2004-2007. Investment banking services have also arranged bond issues for two companies worth a total amount of US$ 1.3 billion (€ 1 billion) during the same period. Several financial institutions have also been found to hold significant shareholdings in four cluster munition producers. And this is only the top of the iceberg.Low Standard of ResponsibilityAlthough 98% of cluster munition victims are civilians, cluster munition producers don’t have any problems attracting capital from financial markets. Financial institutions all over the world seem to have no objections financing companies producing cluster munitions. Expensive and well known concepts like corporate social responsibility and socially responsible investment seem to have little impact on these investment decisions. Financial institutions generally don’t even consider disinvesting from morbid civilian-killers like cluster munitions.On the other hand civil society and affected communities are increasingly realising that the blind allocation of capital resources to this kind of company lends legitimacy to these companies and their continuing production of cluster munitions. A strong signal by the financial community that investing in cluster munitions is no longer meeting their ethical standards, would make a big difference. Best PracticesAmbitious daydreaming? Maybe, but fortunately some financial institutions have already cleared the path for these developments. Recently not only ethical banks but also some mainstream financial institutions have decided to reject any investment in companies involved in cluster munitions. Examples are the Belgian KBC, the Norwegian Storebrand and the Norwegian Pension Fund.Time for a Ban on InvestmentsOf course governments can also play a big role in reallocating capital resources away from cluster munitions. Firstly they can give the good example by excluding cluster munition investments from government funds, secondly they can vote laws banning investments in these weapon systems. Recent steps have been taken by the European Parliament, and the Belgian and Norwegian Parliaments. Now that Norway has taken the initiative to work on an international treaty to ban cluster munitions, including a ban on investments in the treaty could make a major shift.  "

Geneva ",Human Rights are Banking Risks,,,,,,"
Financial institutions can play an important role in promoting human rights, as well as respecting them by preventing or minimizing the social and environmental harm that may be caused by their transactions.


Too often, Banks are complicit in human rights by ignoring the human rights violations of clients while providing financial assistance for the client's activities. To avoid this situation banks should develop robust human rights policies, in the same spirit as they have collectively developed the Equator Principles to deal with social and environmental risks in project lending. The Equator Principles themselves fall far short as a tool to adequately manage human rights risks; better and more detailed policies are needed.


This is the message conveyed today by BankTrack to Mr John Ruggie, UN Special Representative for Business and Human Rights, at the “Consultation on human rights and the financial sector“ taking place in Geneva. The meeting is meant to inform Mr Ruggie on the distinct responsibilities of financial institutions as non-state actors to respect and promote human rights.


In Geneva, BankTrack also releases its new briefing paper “Human rights, Banking risk; incorporating human rights obligations in bank policies“. The paper details what BankTrack considers the human rights responsiblities of banks and what are the elements of a robust human rights policy for banks.


“In the last years, the focus of banks and NGOs alike has been on the social and environmental effects of bank lending“, said Johan Frijns, BankTrack coordinator, “yet there are too many people forced off their lands, too many workers exploited in sweatshops and on plantations, too many arms traded, too many authoritarian regimes kept afloat and too many trigger happy security forces protecting Bank financed projects all over the world to leave human rights issues outside the debate on what responsible banking is all about.“


“It is important that the end report of Mr John Ruggie to the UN Secretary General includes a specific section on the role of financial institutions. Given their role in financing many human rights sensitive sectors and activities and their associated leverage over clients, their potential positive impact can hardly be overstated“ said Andreas Missbach, who represents BankTrack at the meeting in Geneva.

Basel, Zuerich ",Credit Suisse involved in Malaysian logging giants stock exchange listing,Credit Suisse ,Switzerland,Samling ,forestry - pulp and paper,Hong Kong,"
Credit Suisse of Switzerland, British HSBC and the Australian Macquarie Bank are taking steps to list Samling Global Ltd, a Malaysian logging company, on the Hong Kong stock exchange. The sale of shares will start on 23 February, with official trading set for 7 March. Samling expects to raise 280 million US Dollars from the listing and intends to use the money for expansion and to repay debts.  The Malaysian Samling group, which is based in the Malaysian state of Sarawak on Borneo, is one of Malaysia`s biggest logging companies and responsible for the ongoing destruction of large areas of tropical rainforest. Samling oversees about 4 million hectares of forest concessions in Malaysia, Guyana, China and New Zealand. In the past, the company was also active in Cambodia and Papua New Guinea, where it was involved in illegal logging activities.  Samling has been particularly criticized for the systematic destruction of tropical rainforests in the Malaysian state of Sarawak on the island of Borneo, one of the world`s centers of biological diversity and home to the Penan people who live in the rainforest.  On 7 February 2007, the Malaysian police cleared a logging road blockade that a group of Penan had set up to protect one of Sarawak’s last remaining areas of tropical rainforest from logging by the Samling corporation. Many Penan communities, such as the nomadic Penan group under chieftain Along Sega, are permanently being threatened by bulldozers of the Samling corporation. Together with other companies, it has already destroyed large parts of the rainforests on the Penan`s native lands.  Samling fails to meet basic ecological and social standards in other countries too. In January 2007, the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) suspended the certification of a Samling forest concession comprising 570,000 hectares in the South American state of Guyana because the company did not comply with the certification standards.  By cooperating with Samling on the occasion of its listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange, Credit Suisse, HSBC and Macquarie are making themselves part of the irresponsible and destructive logging practices and human rights violations of the Samling group. The Bruno Manser Fonds and the Berne Declaration ask the involved banks to cease their involvement with Samling’s listing immediately and to stop their business relationship with the Malaysian logging group.

Manila, Utrecht ",Strong criticism on Reopening Lafayette Rapu Rapu mine Philippines,ABN AMRO ,Netherlands,Rapu Rapu copper mine ,mining - non coal,Philippines,"
Rapu-Rapu community leaders, the Bishop of Sorsogon, Philippine and international environmental organizations have all strongly condemned the Philippine government's decision to allow the open-pit mine of Lafayette Philippines Inc. (LPI) in Rapu-Rapu, Albay province to return to full-scale commercial operations.They warned that the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), by granting a so called Permanent Lifting Order, has unleashed a multi-billion peso environmental time bomb and an impending social disaster on the small and fragile island.Bishop Arturo Bastes, who lead a official fact finding commission on the case, condemned the decision of the DENR Secretary Angelo Reyes, as having ""utter and blasphemous disregard for the findings and recommendations issued by official investigatory bodies, particularly the Rapu-Rapu Fact Finding Commission"".""I vehemently object to Sec. Reyes' decision. I believe that everything about the Lafayette project is still defective. Rapu-Rapu people will stage demonstrations to condemn this decision of the DENR on February 11 and 12,"" the indignant Church leader said.Defend Patrimony! Alliance Spokesperson and geologist Trixie Concepcion stated: ""It's an anti-people and environmentally destructive decision. The people of Rapu-Rapu are already so traumatized and deprived by the damage left by the HIXBAR mining company operating on the island earlier and the previous mine spills of Lafayette, where the land utilized by its operations has turned denuded, barren, acidic, and  unproductive.Lafayette's large-scale mining operations will cause more tragedies and devastation in the island. Through and through the government has revealed how it advances and defends the interest of foreign mining corporations such as Lafayette at the expense of our people and the environment,""""The mine will only aggravate poverty among the people. Rich opportunities for agricultural development will be obliterated by open-pit mining, forest denudation, landslides, and massive soil erosion. Rapu-Rapu's abundant marine life will also be gradually destroyed, as the cyanide contamination, fish kills demonstrate, and the people's livelihood will be eventually wiped out"" she continued.""We condemn in the strongest possible terms the decision of DENR Secretary Angelo Reyes to allow Lafayette to continue its mining operations,"" Clemente Bautista, national coordinator of environmental activist group Kalikasan-PNE.""The DENR has completely ignored the people's strong opposition against the project and the negative impacts that Lafayette has caused to the people of Rapu-rapu and other nearby municipalities. How can the DENR utterly disregard the community displacements, cyanide contamination, fish kills, landslide, militarization, and human rights violations experienced by the local people resulting from the entry and operation of Lafayette? The people have no recourse but to continue and intensify their struggle and protest actions to drive out Lafayette in their island,"" Bautista said.The decision to allow reopening of the mine has also provoked strong  reactions from international environmental organisations as Greenpeace and BankTrack;Beau Baconguis, Campaigner for Greenpeace Southeast Asia said: “Greenpeace has consistently maintained that Lafayette’s operations will seriously damage Rapu Rapu and its surrounding fragile marine ecosystem. The mine is precariously located along the country’s typhoon belt, in a small and fragile island environment. Its toxic tailings and the inevitable acid mine drainage will continue to pose a clear and present danger to the surrounding environment and the communities who depend on it. Greenpeace calls on the DENR to reconsider their decision and re-evaluate their priorities. Instead of promoting activities such as  mining which destroy our fragile ecosystems, the government should invest in opportunities which promote the protection of our valuable resources.”""International banks keeping Lafayette afloat are strongly advised not to derive any false reassurances from this decision"", said Johan Frijns, coordinator of BankTrack, ""the issues that make this a extremely risky investment for any bank pretending to be serious about sustainability will remain. With no social license to operate, leading to continued widespread opposition to the mine, and operating under adverse natural conditions the very same issues that led to the earlier suspension of operations will return on their plate.""""Banks as ABN AMRO, ANZ, JPMorgan Chase and Standard Chartered choose to take a huge ´RapuRaputational´ risk with their continued involvement in this mining operation"" said Frijns.

Paris, France ",Calyon to Support Controversial Botnia Pulp Mill Project in Uruguay,Crédit Agricole ,France,Botnia pulp and paper mill ,forestry - pulp and paper,Uruguay,"
Calyon last week confirmed to BankTrack that it has decided to support the controversial Botnia pulp mill project on the Argentine-Uruguayan border. In a meeting with representatives of BankTrack, Calyon staff explained that it believes that the project meets all their relevant investment policies. The bank thereby points to the IFC decision to go ahead with the project despite local opposition, as well as recent conclusions by the Finnish government, discarding a complaint presented by the Center for Human Rights and Environment CEDHA against Botnia for violations of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.In doing so Calyon followed suit with the IFC and the Finnish government, ignoring conclusions by the World Bank's Ombudsman (the CAO), which confirmed project violations of IFC Environmental and Social Safeguards. Calyon, which is the only French bank signatory to the Equator Principles, also ignored an Equator Principles Compliance Complaint filed against Calyon in May of 2006 by nine international organizations, which call on Calyon to withdraw support to Botnia grounded on the CAO project violations findings. Calyon staff argued that the project need not comply with Equator Principles, because it is not a ""project finance"" arrangement.    Meanwhile, on Friday January 12, local community stakeholders for the first time since the Botnia pulp mill conflict began successfully blocked all terrestrial passages linking Uruguay and Argentina, as the bilateral crisis over the installation of the Botnia pulp mill deepens. For several hours during the busiest moment of weekend tourist flows into Uruguay, vehicles could not cross the border at any terrestrial passing as they all were cut off by stakeholders who continue to oppose the installation of Botnia’s largest paper pulp plant still in construction.  Calyon has concluded that such widespread local stakeholder opposition and possible reputational risk exposure is not sufficient to pull out of the multi million dollar deal and the large potential profits the pulp mill project promises for investors. Botnia's plant will be the largest pulp mill plant in Latin America, producing nearly 2 million tons of ECF pulp per year.   ""We are extremely disappointed by this decision of Calyon”, said Johan Frijns, BankTrack coordinator. “So much has gone wrong in obtaining a social license to operate from the Argentine communities adjacent to the plant, who have been utterly neglected right until this day. Yet Calyon chooses to move itself right in the middle of this dispute, citing that the project does not have to meet the Equator Principles that would require such a license to be obtained. So much for the pretentions to be a leading bank on social sustainability issues"". "

Utrecht ",Banks Have a Responsibility in Respecting Human Rights,,,,,,"
BankTrack today sent a letter to Dr. John Ruggie, the United Nations Secretary General’s Special Representative on Human Rights & Business, urging him to call for a more comprehensive approach to human rights responsibilities in the banking sector. 
After the business community rejected the Norms on the Human Rights Responsibilities of Transnational Corporations and Other Enterprises, Dr. Ruggie was appointed by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to clarify and achieve some level of consensus on the scope of the private sector’s human rights obligations. He is currently preparing his Final Report to the UN Commission on Human Rights, which will be completed by Spring 2007. 
Examples of corporate complicity in human rights are well known, but banks also facilitate and benefit from human rights violations,” said Inez Louwagie of Netwerk Vlaanderen, a BankTrack member organization that has published two recent reports on the topic. “In fact, many activities that violate human rights simply cannot occur without banks’ financial backing.""
Although the banking sector has made some progress in developing environmental financing standards in the last several years, banks’ understanding of their role and responsibility regarding human rights is relatively poor. The BankTrack letter offered several examples of how companies associated with human rights problems (including mining company Freeport McMoRan, electronics subcontractor Flextronics, and India-based National Hydroelectric Power Corporation) were backed by loans and capital raised by major financial institutions. 
"" Currently, only about eight major banks have developed their own human rights policies,” said BankTrack coordinator Johan Frijns, referring to a January 2006 BankTrack survey of best practices in bank financing standards. “but even from these statements it is not very clear how human rights considerations affect business decisions. That is no longer an acceptable situation"". 
For example, no banks currently prohibit financing transactions involving controversial economic stabilisation clauses, which can be included in Host Government Agreements (legal frameworks between investors and host governments). Such clauses are designed to reduce financial risks due to unexpected and significant changes in law – even labour and human rights laws. 
""The HGA for the Baku-Tblisi-Ceyhan pipeline, for example, allows the BTC consortium to refuse any new human rights laws that the governments of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey  introduce in the next 40-60 years,” said Andrea Baranes of CRBM (Campagna per la Riforma della Banca Mondiale). “This puts the desire of investors to make profit over the obligation of states to progressively fulfill human rights.""
In addition, the letter points out that the Equator Principles, a well-known set of voluntary environmental and social project finance standards, “apply to only a tiny fraction of bank financing activities, and do not adequately address human rights. 
""Project finance is not a common way to finance the production of electronics, footwear, apparel, or controversial weapons -- all sectors with known human rights problems,” explained Andreas Missbach of Berne Declaration, a BankTrack member group. “Even natural resource extraction is corporate financed to a large extent, and not subject to the Equator Principles.” Missbach authored a joint BankTrack report on Swiss banks and their financing of natural resource extraction activities associated with human rights abuses (2006) 
The letter concluded by stressing the ability of banks to play a positive role in human rights. “Corporate clients are clearly within a bank’s sphere of influence,” said Techa Beaumont of MPI, a BankTrack member group. “If the banks exercise their influence to prevent human rights violations rather than enabling them, the banking community can make a valuable contribution towards supporting human rights.""
Human rights obligations of the private financial sector will be one of the key issues for BankTrack to deal with in 2007. "

San Fransisco ",Rainforest Action Network to global banks: do not fund TXU coal-fired power plant,,,,,,"
Rainforest Action Network (RAN) is calling on private
banks around the world to reject Dallas-based utility company TXU’s
solicitations for $11 billion in debt and equity to finance 11 new coal-fired
power plants in Texas. If completed, the new plants will result in 78 million
tons of new carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per year – greater than the total
greenhouse gas emissions of many countries.
The plants, which TXU says will produce nine gigawatts of
electricity by 2011, represent the first phase of TXU’s recently-announced
expansion strategy that also includes the construction of up to 14 additional
gigawatts of similar coal-fired power plants in other parts of the country.
If TXU’s full expansion plan were to be completed, TXU
would become the largest corporate greenhouse gas polluter in the United
States. The outdated pulverized coal-fired technology being promoted by TXU is
widely recognized by regulators and scientists as the highest greenhouse-gas
(GHG)-polluting source of electricity. RAN has issued formal letters to 54
financial institutions, asking them to withhold financing for TXU’s project.
The letters, from RAN’s Executive Director Michael Brune, called the TXU
project a “risky transaction” and warned that in addition to the significant
climate concerns, the expansion of the coal industry “is associated with
destructive and unsafe methods of extraction, as well as the harmful local
impacts of mercury and nitrogen oxide pollution.”
The letters also challenged banks to implement climate
and energy policy protections that would ensure that they reduce the GHG
intensity of their investments, and to support renewable energy sources such as
wind and solar while shifting financial resources away from dangerous energy
sources such as coal and nuclear.
Although GHG emissions are a leading contributor to
climate change, CO2 emissions are currently unregulated in Texas and at the
federal level in the . Texas already suffers from the country’s highest rate of
CO2 emissions, while the generates the most GHG emissions in the world. The 78
million tons of CO2 pollution from TXU’s proposed project will be:
 * Greater than the
GHG emissions of 21 states.
 * Larger than the
total GHG emissions of several countries, including , , and .
 * Larger than ’s
entire emission reduction commitment under the Kyoto Protocol.
 * Twice as large as
’s Kyoto emission reduction commitment.
 * More than 80
percent of the ’s Kyoto emission reduction commitment.
 * Equivalent to the
annual GHG emissions of adding 14 million new cars to roads.
“While governments and corporations around the world are
confronting and trying to solve the global climate crisis, TXU is boldly
proposing one of the most destructive ventures ever seen,” said Brune. “The
world’s financial institutions can prevent this project from ever leaving the
ground by simply declining to be a part of it. We’re calling on banks to say no
to TXU’s dirty energy schemes, and to embrace the environmental values held by
their customers, employees and shareholders.”
The projects three lead arrangers are Citigroup, Morgan
Stanley, and Merrill Lynch. In addition, Barclays Capital, Calyon and WestLB
have been named as second-tier lenders, and numerous other banks have been
approached to join the financing syndicate, including Société Générale, Mizuho
Corporate Bank, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, HypoVereinsbank, Scotiabank, ABN
AMRO, Wachovia and HSBC.
Rainforest Action Network runs hard-hitting campaigns to break America’s oil addiction, protect endangered forests and indigenous rights, and stop destructive investments around the world through education, grassroots organizing, and non-violent direct action.    "

Belgium ",Masterminds behind unethical bank revealed,,,,,,"
Masterminds behind unethical bank revealed.October 2006. A mysterious bank suddenly appears on the Belgian market. The bank is proud to invest in the arms industry, oil- and gas, nuclear power, agrochemicals and companies violating their workers' rights. ACE*bank immediately provokes reactions.After weeks of outrage, enthousiasm and speculations, the belgian ngo -and BankTrack member- NetwerkVlaanderen reveals to be the mastermind behind this fake bank. The action turns out to be part of thecampaign My Money. Clear Conscience?, which protests against controversial investments by commercial banks.This is the amazing ACE* bank story. You can enjoy the video at www.ace-bank.eu (english)The LaunchBrussels, october 2006. A mysterious bank introduces itself on the Belgian market. The bank claims to be the initiative of a major financial group which doesn't want to reveal its identity yet. ACE* bank is a bank with a clear policy: maximum profit, no scruples. Sick of the growing pressure for 'politically correct' investments and sustainability, this young shark fully goes for controversial investments. ACE* bank specialises in investments in the arms industry, oil- and gas, nuclear power, agrochemicals and companies violating their workers' rights. ACE* bank believes firmly in this policy but wants to test the waters: is the customer ready for this straightforward no-nonsense approach? Brussels is chosen as a starting point for a European market research. The first promotion office opens on the 11th of october.  A motivated team of salesmen and -women call in passers-by for an interview about their opinion on the ACE* investment portfolios. Some people are shocked by the details they receive about the investments by ACE*, others like its honesty.   The mediastrategyEveryone is curious about ACE* bank. The major Belgian newspapers report about the launch of this remarkable newcomer on the market. ACE* bank goes for an agressive media approach. Two days after the opening of the Brussels office, the bank sends out a new press release, boasting 'ACE* bank is the Ryan Air of the Financial World'. The bank promises higher interest rates then any other bank, thanks to its low salaries and its choice for interesting projects like Sakhalin, the Russian oil- and gas exploration by Shell. ACE* bank criticises any bank that gives in to pressure from political groups and promises the clients not to miss great investment opportunities like this. Again, the press reacts amased and with curiosity. This is a daring approach, a new wind in the financial world.The outrageIn the meantime, speculations about who is behind this controversial new bank are rising. Journalists start guessing and start pushing the ACE* bank spokesperson for details. He refuses to name the financial backers, but announces to publish their names shortly. At that point, the rumour about the new bank has reached the Commission of Banks and Insurances (CBFA), the commission that controls all the activities by financial institutions on the belgian market. A CBFA deputy director has been alarmed about ACE* bank, which seems to operate without the necessary licences. He rushes to the trendy ACE* promotion office and bumps into the spokesperson of the bank, who tells him to come back during office hours. After a brief and heated discussion, the CBFA deputy director storms down to the nearest police office to file a complaint. That same evening, CBFA decides to send out press releases about the illegal activities of ACE* bank, warning the world against this obscure new company. The suspenseACE* bank decides it's time to react. The bank anounces a press conference a couple of days later, promising to reveal its marketstrategy and financial backers. The press goes mad. Journalists don't know what to think about this. Is ACE* real? Is it a commercial stunt by another bank? Is this bank trying to convince people about the opposite of what it promotes? Is there an ngo behind it? The ACE* bank spokespersons telephone starts ringing of the hook. But ACE* bank doesn't put its cards on the table yet. The press has to wait until the press conference. Some journalists decide not to wait. They start to investigate all possible options. Maybe ACE* bank doesn't really exist. What if it's a campaign? The main suspects, Oxfam, Greenpeace, Netwerk Vlaanderen, etc are questioned about their involvement. Nobody knows anything. Newspapers phone the major communications- and PR bureaus, other banks, advertising specialists etc. Nobody knows anything. But the holes in the net are tightening. One journalist discovers that the ACE* bank office is rented by the City of Brussels. He even manages to get hold of the contracts. He discovers that Netwerk Vlaanderen and the City plan an exhibition about 'sustainable investments', later that month. The same journalist phones Netwerk Vlaanderen undercover, claiming he wants to volunteer for this event. Netwerk tells him the project has been cancelled due to lack of resources. This doesn't stop the newspapers from publishing articles which hesitatingly point at Netwerk Vlaanderen as the main suspect. Not surprisingly, as Netwerk Vlaanderen is known for its direct and confrontational actions about banks. But nobody is absolutely sure, so the pressconference is packed. The repressionThe Commission of Banks and Insurances finds out about the press conference and decides to take action. Whoever is behind this bank, they have to be stopped! 20 minutes before the press conference starts, a group of plain clothed police officers arrives at the bank, with a clear order to arrest all ACE* bank employees. Some of them have a nose for this kind of danger and manage to escape. They call for reinforcements. A diplomat is sent in to negotiate. After his decisive briefing, the officers start laughing and decide to go and have a beer in the nearest pub.The press conference can go ahead as planned. ACE* bank grabs the opportunity to explain to the journalists that it does not differ fundamentally from other banks. The companies in its investment funds also occur in those of financial groups like AXA, ING, Fortis, KBC and Dexia. Why wouldn't ACE bank be allowed to do the same?The revealThe spokespersons assistant starts reading out all the messages of support the bank has received by its potential customers, ending with some more obscure messages from people who feel the urge to throw in the windows and come and puke on the ACE* bank carpet (sic).  Do the ladies and gentlemen of the press have any more questions? Silence, discomfort and confusion. ""In that case, we only want to add one element to your dossier and introduce you to the mastermind behind ACE bank."" Finally, the moment of truth! As if from nowhere, two representatives of Netwerk Vlaanderen enter the building. * ACE bank is not a bank. This is not a hoax. Any resemblance with an existing financial group is purely coincidential. And any other possible dislaimer which keeps banks and their lawyers of our backs. Thank you.VIDEO online now! visit the ACE bank website! "

London, Utrecht ",The Dos and Donts of Sustainable Banking,,,,,,"
BankTrack, the NGO network monitoring the private financial sector, today releases a new publication, 'The Do's and Don’ts of Sustainable Banking; a BankTrack manual'. The publication will be presented at Ethical Corporations’ ‘Sustainable Finance Summit’ in London, during the panel on “Emerging NGO visions of Sustainable Banking”.The manual seeks to answer the straightforward question posed to the panel; ‘what does a really sustainable bank look like?’. It follows the outline of the Collevecchio Declaration, released in 2003, which calls upon financial institutions to embrace six commitments (to Sustainability, to Do No Harm, to Responsibility, Accountability, Transparency, and Sustainable Markets and Governance). The new manual should be seen as the updated implementation guidelines to the Collevechio Declaration, incorporating the latest thinking and expectations of civil society groups on the subject.   It contains a wealth of advice for banks on how to get their house in order, going far beyond what banks now consider as ‘being sustainable’. Amongst other things it argues that becoming a truly sustainable bank requires no less than a change in the overall mission of the institution, to include wider sustainability goals.""Sustainability for the banking sector requires a lot more than cutting down on your paper consumption or even signing up to the Equator Principles""; said Johan Frijns, BankTrack coordinator;""It involves making hard choices and a willingness to forego business opportunities that run counter to your sustainability mission. Contrary to popular belief there is not always a business case for sustainability; there may simply be pressing moral or social reasons to not get involved in a otherwise financially lucrative deal.""  ""There is a need for going far beyond the rhetoric that is currently developing around the topic; this manual shows the way forward for any bank wishing to successfully apply for next years’ Sustainable Banking Awards”, said James Leaton, WWF-UK Policy Advisor, a member of BankTrack.

Sao Paulo, San Fransisco ",Independent Experts Find Fatal Flaws in Amazon Dam Studies,Banco Bradesco ,Brazil,Rio Madeira dams: Jirau and Santo Antonio ,energy plants - dams,Brazil,"
A group of independent experts - including internationally-renowned authorities on the Amazon - have found serious errors and omissions in the environmental impact assessment (EIA) for Brazil's massive Madeira River hydroelectric project. The experts found the EIA to be inadequate, and recommend that additional studies be undertaken to evaluate the project's impacts. The independent studies were commissioned by the Rondônia Public Attorney's office, and financed by the consortium seeking to build the dams. Brazil's environmental protection agency, IBAMA, is currently holding public hearings in Rondônia, the Brazilian state affected by the project, and will then make a decision on whether or not to approve construction of the dams. Glenn Switkes, Latin America Program Director for International Rivers Network, said; ""The experts' review demonstrates that a poorly conceived project with the potential to devastate one of the Amazon's most bio-diverse regions is being railroaded through by the Brazilian government. It is crucial that IBAMA take these opinions into account before it is too late"".Among the panelists was José Tundisi, limnologist and specialist on hydroelectric reservoir management with the International Ecological Institute in São Paulo state, who found the data on sediment accumulation in the reservoirs to be ""inconsistent"" and ""unreliable"".  The Madeira carries one of the highest volumes of soil, sand, and clay of any river in the world. ""Sediment studies should always be undertaken on the river basin level"", he advised. IBAMA limited the study area to that stretch of the Madeira which the project proponents said would be flooded by the dams. Philip Fearnside, ecologist with the National Institute for Amazon Research (INPA), found that there was insufficient data to back up project proponents' assertions that sediment accumulation in the reservoir would not affect the dam's economic viability. He also found that Jirau dam would flood a wider area than projected, extending into neighboring Bolivia. Ronaldo Barthem, of the Goeldi Museum in Belém, and Michael Goulding, of INPA - arguably the world's most preeminent experts on Amazon migratory fish species - warned that under certain conditions, the dams could lead to the extinction of ecologically and economically important fish species such as the dourada and babão. Besides blocking upstream migrations of adult fish, most larva and fry heading downstream would be ground up by the turbines.Even the area to be flooded by the dam could be seriously underestimated by the studies. Bruce Forsberg, a scientist with INPA, found that ""the area flooded could be double that projected (529 sq km) by the project proponents ... casting doubt on the results of all studies carried out to date"". Forsberg also examined the risk that mercury discarded into the river by gold miners would make its way into the food chain as a result of the dams, and found that no attempt was made to quantify how much mercury a river bank dweller eating a daily diet of fish would ingest.Other potential problems identified by the specialists include impacts on downstream lakes which are important fishing grounds; proliferation of vectors for the spread of malaria and other water-borne diseases; and the socio-economic consequences of the migration of tens of thousands of men to the region in search of work.According to Roberto Smeraldi of Friends of the Earth, Amazonia, ""the project aims to transform the entire western Amazon, but the government is treating it as if it had only local impacts."" The Brazilian government is actively promoting the construction of Santo Antonio and Jirau Dams on the Madeira River as part of a larger four-dam cascade to generate electricity and permit barges to navigate 4,200 km up the Madeira to its upstream tributaries in Peru and Bolivia. Environmentalists say the project would not only affect the high biodiversity of the region, but that the Madeira waterway would spur the advance of soy plantations in the Amazon rainforest and surrounding tropical savannas.Brazil's National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES), a federal state-owned bank, has already announced its interest in financing the Madeira River project. The Interamerican Development Bank (IaDB) is also reported to plan partial financing of the project.The federal state-owned bank Banco do Brasil* and the private banks Banco Itaú*, Banco Bradesco* and Banco Santander have also showed interest in financing the project "

Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Sofia, Milan ",European banks withdraw from Belene nuclear power project,Deutsche Bank ,Germany,Belene nuclear power plant ,energy plants - nuclear,Bulgaria,"
UniCredit Group  and Deutsche Bank  have informed a coalition of environmental and watchdog organisations that  they have withdrawn their interest in financing two nuclear power stations  near the Bulgarian town of Belene.   The move comes one week after Standard and Poor´s downrated the Bulgarian utility NEK from ""developing"" to ""negative"" because of its 51  percent participation in Belene , a project with estimated construction  costs of between 2 and 3.5 billion euros.   Sofia-based Petko Kovachev of CEE Bankwatch Network commented: ""The  Belene nuclear power project is a major financial and environmental risk.  Everybody seems to be aware of this except for the Bulgarian government.""  During talks in Vienna last Wednesday between GLOBAL2000, Friends of  the Earth Europe and Greenpeace with UniCredit daughter Bank Austria /  Creditanstalt, the Austrian bank appeared to be fully aware of the fact that  its customers do not want any involvement with risky nuclear investments.  Patricia Lorenz of Friends of the Earth Europe commented: ""It is clear that  these banks are aware of the risks attached to financing nuclear power.  Bank Austria was one of the driving forces to quit UniCredit's engagement in  the Belene projekt as they saw big risks.""   With the decision of UniCredit Group and Deutsche Bank to withdraw from  the Bulgarian Belene nuclear power plant (NPP) project, both bidding  consortia for building the NPP have lost a large part of their financial  backing. The Russian Atomstroyexport has been counting on the participation of its German partner Siemens receiving credits from the  UniCredit Group daughter HVB/Hypovereinsbank and Deutsche Bank. The  Czech/Russian Skoda Alliance is reliant on support from UniCredit via its  Czech daughter Zivnostenska Banka.Bulgarian Economy and Energy Minister Rumen Ovcharov had indicated  earlier this week that next Tuesday the choice of building contractor for  Belene would be announced.   Jan Haverkamp, Greenpeace´s nuclear energy expert for Central Europe,  said: ""I am curious whether that will happen now as we can see the financial  bottom of the project falling away. It is time that Bulgaria shelves this ill- conceived nuclear dream and looks to the future. Bulgaria has immense  capacity to cut down its energy wastage, which in a matter of years can free  up more capacity than Belene would ever generate. On top of that it has  huge untapped resources in renewable energy like wind, biomass, hydro  and solar. This is a moment of opportunity for Bulgaria: We call on the  Bulgarian government to change its energy policy now.""   Last week, on Friday the 13th, citizens and environmental groups in 23  countries protested at their local bank branches against the interest of  UniCredit Group in Belene . In Germany thousands of people sent cards  to HVB and Deutsche Bank to express their discontent with the interest of  the banks to finance dangerous nuclear projects and protests in 60 cities in  Germany were planned for next week. Heffa Schücking of the German  organisation urgewald said: ""It is clear that many people have not forgotten  Chernobyl and do not accept that their bank should support new nuclear  projects.""   Earlier this year Bayerische Landesbank and Commerzbank also denied  involvement in the Belene project, although they had been mentioned by  Bulgarian Economy and Energy Minister Rumen Ovcharov as interested. In  the summer, the Belgian KBC Group denied wanting to finance Belene via  its Czech daughter CSOB and the French Societé Génerale Group withdrew  its Czech daughter Komercni Banka from the Skoda Alliance after receiving  information about the risks attached to Belene.   Jan Haverkamp concluded: ""UniCredit and Deutsche Bank have recently  also expressed interest in other shaky nuclear projects in Central Europe,  like Mochovce in Slovakia and Cernavoda in Romania. We sincerely hope  that their withdrawal from Belene also means that they will now fully shift  their focus towards real solutions like the development of energy efficiency  and renewable energy sources in the region.""   NOTES FOR THE EDITOR  Pictures of Belene and last week's protests are available from the above- mentioned contact addresses.  Fact sheets are available on the chronology of the Belene NPP project,  problems with Belene and the firms so far involved in the Belene NPP  project. They can be obtained from the above-mentioned contact addresses.  (1) UniCredit Group runs the main bank brands of UniCredito in Italy, HVB in  Germany, Bank Austria-Creditanstalt in Austria and is owner of a large  amount of local bank brands in mainly Central and Eastern Europe.  (2) Standard & Poor´s, 11 October 2006  (3) The Belene project started in the 1980s and was stopped in 1992  because of environmental and economic concerns. The project drew amongst others criticism because it is sited in a seismic active area. In  2003, the Bulgarian government revived the project in the hope to create a  strong position in the electricity market on the Balkans. Critics, however,  point out that at least one of the proposed reactor designs (the VVER  1000/320) would not be admissible in, for instance, Germany. The other  proposed design has not been licensed in Europe before. Since its revival  the project was plagued with manipulations, delays and controversies, the  latest being the revelation in the Bulgarian press that Bulgarian Energy  Minister Ovcharov receives almost three-quarters of his monthly salary from  nuclear state companies (the Bulgarian newspaper 24 hours, edition 17  October 2006). The approval of the Environmental Impact Assessment is  already for almost two years held up under court appeals because of its bad  quality and manipulated procedures.

Around Europe ",UniCredito faces Europe-wide protests over Bulgarian Nuclear Plant,UniCredit ,Italy,Belene nuclear power plant ,energy plants - nuclear,Bulgaria,"
The UniCredit Group is offering financing for the construction of a new nuclear power plant (NPP) in Bulgaria. The Belene NPP is highly controversial since it is planned in an earthquake zone, close to the Romanian border. Only 12 kilometers away from the project site, 200 people died in an earthquake in 1977, a fact that is completely ignored by Bulgarian authorities. Furthermore, the planning of the project continues to be marred by manipulations that have resulted in an already one-and-a-half year ongoing court struggle over the NPP’s Environmental Impact Assessment.  Two consortia are bidding to construct Belene and UniCredit is involved in both of them: Its German daughter HypoVereinsBank (HVB) is considering financial support for the participation of Siemens/Areva NP in the Russian-led AtomStroyExport consortium. Another daughter, Zivnostenska Banka, is backing the Czech/Russian Skoda Alliance consortium. In a letter from August 2006, 160 organisations from around the world criticize the Belene NPP as a “recipe for disaster” and call on Unicredit to say No to this controversial project.Read full text of letter here.  Today environmental organisations will carry their protest directly to UniCredit and its branches all over Europe. Activists will picket local branches of the UniCredit Group banks, such as HVB and Bank Austria/Creditanstalt (BA-CA) and inform their clients about the bank's interest in financing the Belene nuclear power plant. In other countries management will be approached with protest letters. Protest actions will take place, among others, in Bulgaria, Romania, Austria, Germany, Italy, Croatia, Bosnia Herzegovina, Serbia, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovak Republic.

Berlin, Germany ","Oil for Germany, at any cost",,,Sakhalin II oil and gas project ,oil and gas,Russian Federation,"
Urgewald proudly presents a new study ""Oel fuer Deutschland -  Koste es was es wolle"" (Oil for Germany - at any  cost) on the  Russian oil industry, environmental destruction  and human rights violations it causes and how  German banks are involved through their financing  of Russian oil companies.  The aim of the study is to raise awareness of  these problems - especially with  parliamentarians, civil servants and the decision  makers in public and private banks - in order to  hold them to account for their financing and to  promote ecological and social standards for  financing in the oil sector.  The study explains the Russian political context,  how financing in the oil sector takes place and  includes case studies, e.g. the vast oil  pollution in the West-Sibirian oil fields, the  oil and gas project Sakhalin II and the D6 oil  platform in front of the Curonian Spit.  The study evaluates 83 syndicated loans granted  by international banks to Russian oil and gas  companies over the past 10 years with a total  credit volume of more than 60 billion US$. The  evaluation shows, that German banks have been  involved in more than 80% of the loans.  The study is in  German, however it contains a  comprehensive table of the 83 granted syndicated  loans in English. The table does not only include  the German banks that are involved but  international banks as well. Read the report: Oel fuer Deutschland -  Koste es was es wolle "

Brussels, Belgium ",Banks continue to invest in cluster munitions,Belfius ,Belgium,,,,"
Since the spring of 2006, Belgium is the first land to introduce a ban on cluster munitions. Despite this, the bank groups AXA, Dexia, Fortis and ING invest in cluster munitions. This has been revealed on September 14th in a new report ‘Explosive portfolios’ published by Netwerk Vlaanderen. Although pressure from the campaign ‘My Money. Clear Conscience?’  forced four bank groups to announce their withdraw from investments in cluster munitions, it is apparent that only KBC has completely ended its investments. Meanwhile this summer Israeli use of cluster munitions in Lebanon has been the starting shot for a new humanitarian disaster.
Explosive portfolios
Netwerk Vlaanderen has researched the financial links between five bank groups (AXA, Dexia, Fortis, ING and KBC) and thirteen producers of cluster munitions. The report reveals that these banks invest more than six billion dollars in these companies. The French company Thales, the US company Raytheon, the Korean Poongsan, and the European EADS are examples of companies that are involved in cluster munitions.   The report shows that the defence policy of Dexia, Fortis and ING is not satisfactory. These three companies announced in 2005 that they would end their direct investments in, and financing of, cluster munitions. Their investment funds, including some available in Belgium, allow their customers to continue investing in these weapons. Despite the new policies, the investments of Fortis and ING in some cluster munitions producers have even increased.  In July 2005, Fortis and ING already called into question the believability of their new policy, by giving direct financing to EADS, a European cluster bomb producer. If ethics stand in the way of important deals with big clients, the banks are able to use convenient loopholes in their policy.  AXA continues to be the only bank group that has not introduced any restriction regarding cluster munitions. AXA invests more than 5.5 billion dollars in the investigated producers.   
A portfolio without cluster munitions
 The good news comes from the bank group KBC. This is the only bank group to have completely withdrawn from cluster munitions. KBC has already placed nineteen producers of cluster munitions on a black list. The policy of KBC is also ahead of the other banks concerning the transparency and controllability of the policy. 
Government must act
The report shows that self-regulation is not enough to halt the flow of money to cluster munition producers. Netwerk Vlaanderen calls on the government to take initiative. Now that Belgium has a ban on cluster munitions, a legal ban on the investment in cluster munitions is an important next step. The controllability of the ethical promises made by the banks must also be enforced. Public bodies can also give a good example by ending their own saving and investments in cluster munitions.  "

Australia and Papua New Guinea ",NGOs lodge complaint against ANZ Bank for PNG illegal logging ties,ANZ ,Australia,,,,"
Five community groups from Australia and Papua New Guinea today filed a formal complaint against the ANZ Bank over its financial support of logging companies that are engaged in human rights abuses and environmental destruction in PNG. The complaint (or ""specific instance"") was filed under the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. The complaint alleges that ANZ is ""actively facilitating and supporting"" the PNG operations of Malaysian logging giant Rimbunan Hijau, a company whose operations involve ""serious human rights abuses, environmentally devastating logging practices and repeated, serious illegal conduct."" ANZ has acknowledged Rimbunan Hijau is a ""long-standing client"" in PNG.Annie Kajir, CEO of the Environmental Law Centre in PNG, said: ""Compliance with basic human rights and environmental standards should be a strict condition of doing business with a reputable bank like ANZ. We hope mediation under the OECD Guidelines will help the bank improve its standards in PNG."" ""ANZ and other banks can play a constructive role by supporting sustainable, community- based forestry in PNG. We are asking the Commonwealth of Australia to use its powers under the OECD Guidelines to help companies in its jurisdiction do the right thing,"" Ms Kajir said.Charles Berger, ACF Legal Adviser, said: ""While ANZ has made good progress in being a more responsible corporation in Australia, we would like to see the same sort of commitment for the bank's PNG operations. Dealing with corporate recidivists like Rimbunan Hijau should be a no-go zone for the bank."" Under the guidelines, the Australian OECD National Contact Point, an authority within the Commonwealth Department of Treasury, has power to mediate the dispute.The groups filing the complaint are the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Human Rights Council of Australia and three PNG community groups: the Environmental Law Centre, the PNG Eco-Forestry Forum and the Centre for Environmental Law and Community Rights (CELCOR).ACF and CELCOR's recently released report, 'Bulldozing progress: Human rights abuses and corruption in PNG's large scale logging industry', is available at: www.acfonline.org.au.

The Netherlands ",Equator Principles Re-Launched,,,,,,"
BankTrack welcomes any initiative that enhances the social and environmental sustainability of bank financing operations. BankTrack acknowledges the improvements in the new version of the Equator Principles (EPs), such as the expansion of the Principles to cover financial advising and the lower threshold, but also believes that the EPs fail to live up to their potential.    The Era of Implementation As the Equator banks have recognized, implementation is critical to the success of the Principles. Since the EP's inception, BankTrack has consistently supported the goal of EP implementation and compliance by encouraging the adoption of robust governance and accountability systems.
Some of BankTrack's feedback, such as the suggestion to regularly review the Principles with an eye toward continuous improvement, was taken on board in the revision and is very much welcome.  (See NGO Comments on the Revision for the Equator Principles).  However, the EP's most fundamental governance and accountability problems still have yet to be adequately addressed
Governance, Implementation and Compliance Systems
EP banks must adopt more robust governance and implementation systems, such as a procedure for dealing with ""free riders"" and a regular reporting requirement.  At the request of the EP banks, BankTrack produced a simple proposed disclosure framework for the banks on implementation. Although the revised Equator Principles (EP2) now includes new transparency requirements, they fall short of what would be minimally adequate to provide a confident accounting of EP compliance.
Independent Accountability Mechanism
BankTrack further believes that the EP banks should adopt an accountability mechanism that would allow communities affected by projects supposedly governed by the EPs to seek redress for problems they may encounter. BankTrack is disappointed that the EP banks have not taken the opportunity provided by the EP revision to provide for such an accountability mechanism.
The proof is in the portfolio
It has not yet been proven on a generalized basis that the EPs are making a difference to communities on the ground. Today, EP banks still are involved in environmentally and socially harmful projects.  For example, at this time, EP banks represent the majority of financial institutions bidding on the deeply controversial and non-EP compliant Sakhalin II project.  This invites legitimate allegations of 'greenwash' which illustrates the urgent need for EP implementation, compliance and accountability systems.
EPs: A Baseline But Not Best Practice
BankTrack welcomes the areas in which the revised EPs have embraced higher environmental and social standards. For example, as the Equator banks have pointed out, the International Finance Corporation Performance Standards (IFC PS) and therefore the EPs now have stronger standards on labor and working conditions, and a new requirement to covenant clients to host-country environmental and social laws.
However, BankTrack regrets the fact that the Equator banks have chosen to reject certain IFC improvements, and to follow the IFC where it weakened its policies. For example, EP2 did not adopt a new IFC requirement on revenue and contract transparency for extractive industries clients, a measure designed to promote good governance and combat corruption. And on the important issue of Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement, the IFC PS and EP2 actually reverses a previous World Bank policy and no longer recognizes people without 'recognizable' land titles. The EP banks should rectify this.
BankTrack views the EPs as a baseline, rather than best practice, in the field of sustainable financing policies. Banks’ financing standards should uphold international best practices, norms and laws, and EP2 fails to do so in some key areas. For example, human rights are enshrined in international law but are not adequately addressed in the IFC PS and the revised EPs. International law also provides indigenous peoples with the right to give or withhold their Free, Prior and Informed Consent for activities that may affect their traditional territories and resources; but the IFC PS and EP2 does not provide for this.  
A recent BankTrack study found that many banks have already adopted individual environmental and social financing policies that go beyond the Equator Principles. However, the report also found that with few exceptions, these policies are lagging significantly behind international norms, standards and best practices.

Switzerland ",Solidly Swiss?,Credit Suisse ,Switzerland,,,,"
Neither UBS nor Credit Suisse operate mines or drilling rigs. But Berne Declaration and BankTrack wanted a more complete picture of the involvement of the two leading Swiss banks in the extractive industries. In our research, we examined the financial links between Swiss banks and  firms involved in the oil, mining and gas industry. We concentrated on significant financing of companies engaged in conflicts with local populations that occurred within the past five years. In over 60 individual cases, our research has shown how raw material extraction lead to human rights violations. The Swiss banks urgently need sound internal standards, in order to responsibly deal with the challenges of human rights, extractive industries and the related issue of climate change.Solidly Swiss?

Brussels, Belgium ",No party time for Burmese democrats,Belfius ,Belgium,,,,"
On 19th of june 2006, the Burmese Nobel Prize winner San Suu Kyi celebrated her 61st birthday. Her party, the National League for democracy, asks the Belgian banks not to invest in companies with important activities in Burma. The leader of the Burmese democrats calls for an economic boycott of her country and states that foreign investments offer financial and moral support to the military dictators. The City of Brussels, which has recently become ‘Municipality for Burma’, also objects to investments in companies with activities in Burma. The financial groups AXA, Dexia, KBC, Fortis and ING are not willing to give up these investments. Reason for Netwerk Vlaanderen, a Belgian ngo promoting sustainable investments, to pay them a visit.   Time for action In the early morning Netwerk Vlaanderen distributed birthday cards amongst the employees of ING, Dexia, Fortis and KBC. They asked them to give a birthday present to San Suu Kyi by urging their bank to disinvest from companies in Burma.  Later that day a delegation of Burmese democrats, human rights activists, actors and a filmcrew, visited the Brussels City Council. They were received by Bruno De Lille, Deputy Mayor for international solidarity. He explained why the city of Brussels has become ‘Municipality for Burma’ and voiced his birthday message for San Suu Kyi in front of the camera. This message will be broadcast in Burma. After this intervention, the delegation visited the headquarters of ING, Fortis, KBC and Dexia. The activists asked the spokespersons of the banks for their message to San Suu Kyi and read them a statement against investments in Burma, signed by a broad range of international organisations. The banks were treated with a delicious Birthday Cake, an entertaining theatre piece and music. The employees were amused and some of them even sang along to ‘Happy Birthday Aung San Suu Kyi’. If only they would also help to end investments in Burma, everyone would be happy! "

Amsterdam, the Netherlands ",Dutch banks score below the mark on climate policies,,,,,,"
The climate policies of the big Dutch banks are insufficient and lag behind those of big international banks such as the Bank of America and Citigroup. These conclusions are the result of the first major report to compare the nature of  Dutch bank investments : ‘Investing in Climate Change: the Role of Dutch Banks and the Climate Performance Index. Friends of the Earth Netherlands (Milieudefensie) today presented these results during the annual meeting of the branch organisation for Dutch banks, NVB and called on all Dutch banks to improve their climate policies.   Many international banks recognise the role they play in causing climate change. They accept their responsibility by investing  billions in the solution. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are a criteria for approving investments and loans at the Bank of America, J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup. The Bank of America has a seven percent reduction target for the CO2  emissions of its investments in the energy sector.  The research for ‘Investing in Climate Change: the Role of Dutch Banks’, was conducted by Dutch Sustainability Research. The report and the Friends of the Earth Netherlands’ Climate Performance Index clearly show that Dutch banks are failing in the area of climate policies. They lack concrete targets to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of their investments.  The passive approach of Dutch banks is in sharp contrast with the biggest international banks. Dutch banks have developed a few climate products, but leave it completely up to their customers to decide to buy these products. Only three percent of the investments of the big Dutch banks can be called sustainable.  The four largest Dutch banks have over 2,700 billion euro to spend on investments and loans. They use this capital to finance three times the annual carbon dioxide emissions of the entire Netherlands. “We call on the Dutch banks to recognise that they can play a bigger role in tackling climate change ”says Friends of the Earth Netherlands’ Donald Pols. “Major banks show that good climate polices and profits can be compatible. Dutch banks should map out the climate impact of their investments and draft policies to reduce these. In addition they should offer their customers products to help them reduce energy use and stimulate renewable energy.”  The publication of the report and the Climate Performance Index mark the start of Friends of the Earth’s campaign, “Save the climate, banks!”. This campaign is part of the HIER climate coalition which involves more than 40 organisations. "

Paris, France ",International coalition denounces Calyon for its support to Finnish papermill Botnia in Uruguay,Crédit Agricole ,France,Botnia pulp and paper mill ,forestry - pulp and paper,Uruguay,"
Nine organizations including broad civil society networks in 6 countries, filed a  complaint today against Calyon, the international financial investment arm of  Crédit Agricole of France, for violations of the Equator Principles, in Calyon's  support of the highly controversial Finnish papermill in Uruguay in construction  by Botnia. The complaint was modeled after an earlier complaint presented to  ING Group of Netherlands, soon after which ING withdrew US$480 million in pledged  support to Botnia. The filing will be followed by public protests outside of the  French Embassy in Buenos Aires, the headquarters of Calyon and Crédit Agricole  in Paris, and launches what will be a rigorous international campaign against  Calyon and Crédit Agricole to withdraw its support to the mills being constructed  on the Uruguay River, the natural waterway border between Argentina and Uruguay.  The complaint was discussed and prepared in collaboration between the 9 institutions, in 6 countries and consists of 17 pages of evidence that Botnia does  not comply with the Social and Environmental Safeguards of the International  Finance Corporation (IFC), and suggests that if Calyon finances Botnia, it will be  complicit in violations of human rights and environmental law. These violations have been denounced on numerous occasions by citizens of Gualeguaychú, the Argentine community across the river from the plant site, by CEDHA, by numerous  Uruguayan NGOs, by the Argentine government. The CAO (the Compliance Ombudsman of the IFC) later confirmed many of these accusations, and more recently, consultants hired by the World Bank to review cumulative impact studies done by Botnia and ENCE  (a second Spanish mill) suggested that on many fronts, the EIAs are inconclusive  and further study is needed. A few weeks ago, President Vasquez of Uruguay met  with Paul Wolfovitz, president of the World Bank, requesting that the Bank speed up the approval process for the loans, however, and surprisingly, Wolfovitz's answer was  less than promising, indicating for the first time,that the Bank WOULD NOT finance  these mills for now, since there is no certainty over environmental and social impacts.  Vasquez walked away empty-handed.  Calyon claims to be one of the more responsible French banks on corporate social responsibility, and boasts that it is one of the first banks to sign the Equator Principles, an agreement amongst 40+ international banks that promise to invest responsibly and respect IFC's Social and Environmental safeguards. ING Group of the Netherlands withdrew US$480 million pledges to Botnia due to the inconsistencies of the Finnish project with IFC Safeguards, although they  would never admit this is the reason, since they might face lawsuits from Botnia.  ""It is unfortunate"", says Johan Frijns, coordinator of BankTrack (an NGO network that has been working closely with groups in Argentina on advocacy before the financial backers of the Botnia and ENCE mills), ""that Calyon, another Equator Bank, has stepped into this arrangement. ING did the right thing and pulled its investments.""  Friends of the Earth Uruguay (Redes), Friends of the Earth Argentina, FOE International,  Friends of the Earth Finland, Amis de la Terre France, along with CEDHA of Argentina,  Banktrack - Netherlands, Guayubira of Uruguay, and the World Rainforest Movement  united forces to confront Calyon. The complaint and advocacy action to follow is in close collaboration with the Citizens Environmental Assembly of Gualeguaychú, who protested yesterday before the Swedish Embassy in Buenos Aires, against the Swedish based NORDEA, also for its  support to Botnia. Protests will now move in the next few days to the French Embassy,  and with help from European based groups, to Calyon and Crédit Agricole offices in Paris.  A nascent international civil society movement is emerging bringing together organizations,  networks and other advocates like Ecologistas en Acción of Spain who are pursing Spanish  financing to ENCE, fueling the fire already burning on this international controversy.  At the recent EU-Latin American Summit in Vienna, Argentine president Nestor Kirchner slammed European governments for exporting contaminating industries to developing countries.  Growing international opposition against these mills promises a bleak future for Botnia  and its financial supporters like Calyon and NORDEA. Calyon will have to face being seen  as the black sheep of the Equator Banks, something that will surely hurt its public image,  and its intentions to be seen as the ""good"" and ""responsible"" French Bank.Read the letter of compliant here.

San Francisco ",Global banking giant ABN AMRO awarded for environmental hypocrisy,ABN AMRO ,Netherlands,Sakhalin II oil and gas project ,oil and gas,Russian Federation,"
A full page advertisement in today's Washington Post exposes Dutch banking giant ABN Amro's environmental hypocrisy for bidding to fund one of the most environmentally and socially destructive projects in history. The ad comes the day before ABN Amro is scheduled to accept the World Environment Center's 2006 Gold Medal Award for ""International Corporate Achievement in Sustainable Development. Purchased by Rainforest Action Network, Pacific Environment and Sakhalin Environment Watch, the ad calls on ABN Amro to live up to its reputation as a global leader in sustainability and withdraw its bid to finance the highly controversial Sakhalin II oil and gas project, the biggest oil and gas exploration project in history. The bank was a leader in the development and institution of the Equator Principles, the first ever framework for incorporating social and environmental practices in private bank lending. Due to the impacts to several endangered species, including the world's 100 remaining Western Grey Whales, as well as the negative impacts on the local fishing community, Sakhalin II violates these principles.""Sakhalin II's radical resource extraction is exactly the type of project that the Equator Principles were designed to prevent""; said Ilyse Hogue, director of Rainforest Action Network's Global Finance Campaign. ""While other banks are making tough decisions and centralizing sustainability in their business operations, ABN Amro is forsaking its commitment to these principles by bidding to fund this project. To accept an environmental award while doing so is environmental hypocrisy at its worst. ABN Amro and all other Equator Banks have no credible choice but to withdraw their support for Sakhalin II.""The ad affirms that ABN Amro promotes itself as an environmental leader for having led the 2003 implementation of the Equator Principles. Led by Royal Dutch Shell, Sakhalin II is a $20 billion operation to extract oil and gas from beneath the coast of Far East Russia's Sakhalin Island. Several Equator Principles signatory banks have declined to fund Sakhalin II due to serious environmental and social concerns, including the danger to the Western Pacific Gray Whale, a population on the verge of extinction. ""ABN Amro giving money to Sakhalin II is the same as giving money for extinction of whales and the destruction of salmon runs"" said David Gordon, Pacific Environment's Executive Director. ""ABN Amro should be a real environmental leader and reject financing for oil drilling in Sakhalin."" Other concerns include a planned pipeline that would span 21 active seismic faults and hundreds of wild salmon spawning habitats, as well the dumping of two million tons of dredging spoil into Aniva Bay – threatening a key fishery and the livelihoods of many Sakhalin islanders. BankTrack, an international campaign network focusing on private investments has released a report entitled ""Sakhalin II Gas and Oil Project: Further Breaches of the Equator Principles"" that details the violations of the project. ABN Amro will be honored at The World Environment Center's (WEC) greenwashing gala in Washington, D.C. this Friday. The WEC is an industry-driven organization, heavily led and supported by Shell, that purports to promote sustainable development by multinational corporations. Past Gold Medal 'environmental leaders' include Dow Chemical, British Petroleum, DuPont, Exxon, and Royal Dutch Shell. Activists plan to be at Friday's event to present ABN Amro with an award for Outstanding Environmental Hypocrisy, an honor they truly deserve. ""The future of our land and our way of life is at risk"", said Dmitry Lisitsyn of Sakhalin Environment Watch. ""There is a clear opportunity here to invest in the long term health of our community and our environment rather than the short term profits generated from this destructive oil project. We call on ABN Amro and all financial institutions, especially those that have signed the Equator Principles, to reject this project""++++Rainforest Action Network campaigns for the forests, their inhabitants,and the natural systems that sustain life by transforming the global marketplace through education, grassroots organizing, and non-violent direct action.

Brussels, Belgium ",KBC throws eleven cluster bomb producers out of its portfolio,KBC ,Belgium,,,,"
Last week KBC bank revealed that eleven more weapon producers have been added to their “black-list” of companies. KBC has stated that it will no longer invest in these eleven companies, who are all involved in the production of cluster munitions. This decision has been taken in the context of a stricter policy of the bank group in relation to the arms trade. Netwerk Vlaanderen, Vrede, Forum voor Vredesactie and For Mother Earth warmly welcome this decision. KBC has shown that it is taking the implementation of its weapon policy seriously.Eleven weapon producers removed from portfolioThe British company BAE Systems, US Northrop Grumman, German Rheinmetall and Korean Poongsan are examples of companies that have been placed on the black-list of KBC. These companies are all involved in the production of cluster munitions. Textron, Lockheed Martin and EADS are amongst the arms companies that have already been placed on the list, which now contains 19 companies. KBC will not invest in, or finance, companies on the black-list. KBC investors will no longer find these companies in their portfolios.A logical consequence of a strict policyThis new decision takes place in the context of a stricter KBC policy in relation to weapon producers that was introduced in 2004. The policy was prompted by the campaign of Netwerk Vlaanderen and a number of peace organisations, “My Money. Clear Conscience?”, that opposed investments in the arms trade. KBC first decided to ban companies which were involved in the production of internationally prohibited weapon systems. This was followed by producers of cluster munitions and depleted uranium weapons. Although there is no international treaty outlawing these weapons, they are both highly controversial. KBC one step ahead of the packOther banks including Dexia, Fortis and ING have adopted stricter investment policies. KBC is, however, the first conventional bank group which applies this policy across all of its products. KBC therefore also excludes these weapon producers from its investment funds. The exclusion of eleven further producers of cluster munitions shows that KBC is taking implementation of this policy seriously.Cluster bombs, the new landminesCluster munitions are highly controversial weapons. They are bombs, mortars, and rockets that spread tens or hundreds of smaller bombs (sub-munitions) over a wide area. The fact that the weapons are spread in this way creates a serious danger for civilians during the attack. Even years after the conflict has ended cluster munitions can cause civilian casualties. The large number of sub-munitions that do not explode during the attack creates a ‘de facto’ minefield. The use of these weapons the past 30 years in areas such as Afghanistan, Iraq, and the former Yugoslavia has left a trail of civilian casualties.It is therefore not surprising that the weapon has faced significant international pressure. Kofi Annan (Secretary General of the United Nations) has called for cluster munitions to be placed on the agenda in 2006. The European Parliament has called on all member states to introduce a moratorium on these weapons, and to ban investments in these weapons. In many countries there are initiatives to ban the production or use of these weapons. Since March 2006, Belgium is the first country to pass a law banning the trade, production and use of cluster munitions. "

London ",Shell poses unacceptable oil spill threat,,,Sakhalin II oil and gas project ,oil and gas,Russian Federation,"
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) should demand effective environmental protection measures for oil spills from Shell or decline funding to the project according to WWF. Currently the oil giant’s project will expose a highly endangered whale population and a pristine arctic environment to unacceptable risks from marine oil spills that could last for years.
A new report released today concludes that the highly dynamic sea ice conditions around Shell’s Sakhalin operation, which can dominate for more than six months of the year, would mean that the company would not be able to respond to a major oil spill for half of the year or longer. Traditional oil spill response methods are rendered impotent because of the predominant sea ice and prevailing weather conditions.
There is a very real potential that any unrecovered oil would contaminate the whales’ only known feeding grounds and the marine environment for years. This would put the last western gray whales in very real jeopardy. WWF commissioned the Considerations for oil spill response in broken sea ice conditions report from independent oil and gas experts.
“It is shocking to see that in the rush to develop new oil and gas supplies Shell is gambling with the environment,” said Robert Napier, WWF Chief Executive. “This is the worst place on earth to have to respond to an oil spill. Even with the latest technology and perfect weather conditions it would be impossible to clean up oil spills for 50 per cent of the time. During summer, wave height and wind conditions can overwhelm response technologies. In winter, the combination of dynamic sea ice, low visibility, and cold temperatures can shut down most large-scale response systems.”
In a briefing paper Shell proposes to use natural openings, called polynyas, in the sea ice to burn off any oil spills. However these ice clearings are a vital focal area for marine life from plankton to marine mammals. Burning oil in them could have impacts on the entire food chain that Shell has not considered.
Robert Napier continued: “The EBRD can not agree to fund this project if they are serious about their environmental values and want to maintain their credibility. If they go ahead and fund
Sakhalin their social and environmental reputation will be in tatters.”
Shell has not produced oil spill models for the Sakhalin II project with sea-ice conditions. The report goes further in emphasizing that there are no existing mathematical models to predict the movement of oil in ice. Without this information the environmental impact assessment is incomplete.
The
Sea of
Okhotsk is one of the most challenging places to drill for oil with dynamic sea ice for six months of the year as well as dense fog, high winds and waves. However in the summer months it comes alive with a wealth of migratory species including the endangered Steller’s sea eagle and the western gray whale. Drilling for oil in such a fragile area important for wildlife is the reason why rigorous contingency plans should be in place for oil spills.
James Leaton, WWF oil expert, said: “There is a 24 per cent chance of an oil spill during the lifetime of this project. Oil spills this winter in Alaska and off northern
must act as a warning. Neither spill was quickly detected and neither has been cleared up. The one off
has killed thousands of birds – including some endangered ones. The lack of sufficient technology to clean up a spill in icy conditions raises serious questions over Shell’s and other company’s ambitions in the Arctic.”

Editor's notes
 The EBRD are holding a consultation on whether or not they should fund Sakhalin II. This consultation was extended by a week and now closes on 28 April 2006.
 Shell is the majority shareholder (55%) in Sakhalin Energy Investment Company Ltd, the company building Sakhalin II, with smaller partners including Mitsui & Co Ltd, (25%) and Mitsubishi Corp. (20%).
 With pipelines cutting across 800 kilometres, crossing 1,000 watercourses and the construction of a drilling platform and a liquefied natural gas plant, Sakhalin II is currently the largest hydrocarbon construction project in the world. However, it has been bedevilled by cost overruns with the total cost now doubled to over $20billion. Since it has started construction it has broken a number of EBRD environmental and social policies.

Dutch Banking giant ABN AMRO is under pressure at its annual general meeting of shareholders today as environmental organizations are urging it not to finance a controversial energy project in Russia.
The Sakhalin-II project in is one of the biggest oil and gas projects worldwide, and the environmental organizations claim that it violates social and environmental guidelines known as the ‘Equator Principles' for financing major projects.

The Sakhalin-II project, led by oil giant Shell, will threaten the last 100 critically endangered western gray whales with extinction, and will result in severe social and environmental impacts, according to Friends of the Earth International, Sakhalin Environment Watch and Pacific Environment.
Sakhalin-II, in 's Far East , is one of Shell's most prestigious and risky projects. The oil giant is doing everything it can to stick to tight construction deadlines but the environment and local populations are already paying the price.
Sakhalin-II, in 's Far East , is one of Shell's most prestigious and risky projects. The oil giant is doing everything it can to stick to tight construction deadlines but the environment and local populations are already paying the price.
Here are some recent problems:
 

Dredging waste was dumped into the fisheries-rich Aviva Bay. Local fishermen fear that their livelihood is threatened.   
Shell refused to take over most of the recommendations from the independent ‘Whale Advisory Panel' and built a platform concrete base last summer in the absence of key mitigation measures to protect whales.
The construction of pipelines has led to damage to over 100 wild salmon spawning beds.
Sakhalin-II lacks a comprehensive oil spill response plan, despite great risks due to the icy conditions in the area. A significant oil spill occurred already in 2004 at the port of Kholmsk.

These problems outline a number of violations of the so-called 'Equator Principles', of which ABN AMRO is one of the initiators. 
The bank said that it would not finance projects that do not stick to these principles. Friends of the Earth International, Pacific Environment and Sakhalin Environment Watch therefore expect ABN AMRO not to finance Sakhalin-II. 
""The Sakhalin-II oil and gas project is causing unacceptable damage to our environment, weakening our fisheries based economy, and creating social problems on the island. Shell violated Russian law. If ABN AMRO will take part in this adventure, the bank will definitely loose its face,"" according Alexander Solovev from Sakhalin Environment Watch.
""Sakhalin-II might result in the extinction of the last 100 Western gray whales. ABN AMRO should de-link itself from extinction"" says Doug Norlen from Pacific Environment.  
""ABN AMRO says that it promotes the Equator Principles. Sakhalin-II clearly violates these principles, so if ABN AMRO decides to finance this project, that would make the principles meaningless and ABN AMRO would loose its credibility' says Paul de Clerck of Friends of the Earth International.  "

Amsterdam, The Netherlands ",Shareholders protest against ING investments in human rights abuses,ING ,Netherlands,Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline ,oil and gas,Azerbaijan,"
During the AGM, critical shareholders will question ING about investments in companies that are involved in human rights violations. Recent research demonstrates the financial links between ING and companies that have been criticised due to practices such as support for dictatorial regimes, forced relocations of population, and forced labour. This is published in the report ‘Where do you draw the line? Research into the financial links between five bank groups and companies that violate human rights’, was conducted by Netwerk Vlaanderen, a Belgian organisation promoting sustainability in the financial world.
ING invests in thirteen of the fourteen companies mentioned in the report, with a combined value of more than US$ 1.3 billion. The investments of more than US$ 600 million in both Wal-Mart and Total are striking.
ING has financed the BTC pipeline and the Trans Thai-Malaysia pipeline. The first amount is unknown, the second is worth US$ 19.55 million. ING is also on the shortlist of banks that could become ‘lead arranger’ for the financing of the Sakhalin II gas project in Russia. These projects have been criticised because of the support for undemocratic regimes, the fuelling of regional conflicts, the violation of human rights, and environmental damage.
Support for dictatorships
 
ING invests more than US$ 600 million in Total and other companies with important activities in Burma. Total currently has investments in a gas pipeline in Burma, a land that is ruled with an iron fist by a military junta. Total refuses to pay attention to the international call for disinvestment. The company uses Burmese soldiers, known for their extreme brutality, to clear and protect the route of the pipeline. This Total project ensures a substantial income for the military rulers of the country. The oppression of the local population is strengthened by the activities of Total. Aung San Suu Kyi, leader of the democratic opposition and winner of the Nobel peace prize, has referred to Total as the greatest supporter of the military dictatorship in Burma. However, ING appears to have no problem with investing in this company.
Violations of workers’ rights
 
ING invests more than US$ 600 million in Wal-Mart. This US distribution chain is widely known for its continued breaches of basic workers’ rights. Wal-Mart has been condemned for breaching the child labour laws in its warehouses. In the United States there are still dozens of cases pending against the company for 'union-busting'. The management registers, threatens and illegally fires trade union activists. Trade unions are not welcomed by Wal-Mart, and Wal-Mart has already been found guilty of ‘union busting’ on a number of occasions. Poor conditions are also routine in the subcontractors of Wal-Mart, which advertises itself using the slogan ‘Always Low Prices’. Wal-Mart doesn't seem to take much notice of these criticisms. The company has hardly taken any action to improve these terrible working conditions. Wal-Mart continues to be far behind other companies in this respect. However, ING believes that investing in Wal-Mart is perfectly reasonable.
Human rights abuses related to infrastructure projects
 
ING is also heavily involved in large-scale projects that have been linked to human rights abuses. One example of this is the BTC pipeline, that runs through Turkey, Azerbaijan and Georgia. The project has been called into question because of the support for undemocratic regimes, the fuelling of regional conflicts, the violation of human rights, and environmental damage. Many communities protested against these practices, but the protests were heavily repressed in all three countries. The consultation with the affected communities left a lot to be desired. Those making their criticisms of the pipeline public were often the target of serious repression, arrest and intimidation by the authorities. This is not surprising given the human rights situation in each of the countries. Despite these problems, ING sees no problem in financing the BTC project. Multiple protests against the bank’s involvement in the BTC project have been ignored.
Towards a watertight human rights policy
 
Savers and investors cannot judge the human rights profile of their bank group without clear information. Therefore, the critical shareholders will question ING about its human rights policy. They support Netwerk Vlaanderen’s demand towards the banks to make their human rights policy public, along with a list of the companies and governments in which they are investing.
Netwerk Vlaanderen asks that the bank groups investigate and put an end to their investments in companies that are accused of serious breaches of human rights.
The complete report goes into much more detail regarding these challenges for the bank world, and gives a number of concrete steps that can be taken to achieve a more watertight human rights policy.

San Francisco, USA ",Protests against years of destructive investments at Wells Fargo AGM,Wells Fargo ,United States,Mountain top removal coal mining ,mining - coal ,United States,"
Today, socially responsible investors and a broad spectrum of environmental and human rights advocates protested Wells Fargo’s socially and environmentally destructive investments at the company’s annual general meeting (AGM) of shareholders in San Francisco. Protesters outside the meeting used giant puppets and banners to highlight Wells Fargo’s bad investments in oil and coal companies infamous for environmental destruction and human rights abuses and bad practices like predatory lending in poor communities. Ethical shareholders inside the meeting called on Wells Fargo to follow the lead of their peers in the financial sector and stop investing in destructive oil, coal, logging, and mining operations and adopt a comprehensive policy which meets industry best practices on the environment and human rights.With $435 billion in assets and over 23 million customers, Wells Fargo is the largest US-based bank still operating without comprehensive modern guidelines to govern its investment practices and corporate conduct on a broad range of urgent environmental and social issues. Case studies on DirtyMoney.org show how Wells Fargo supports radical extraction practices like clear-cutting forests and leveling mountaintops, often on public land for private profit, from Ecuador to Alaska to West Virginia.Despite persistent calls from citizen action groups, Wells Fargo has refused to incorporate new industry best practices on the environment, instead substituting PR and greenwash for action. While the company released a 10-point environmental plan significantly weaker than the industry’s best and riddled with loopholes, it has shown its true colors by investing millions of dollars in Massey Energy, a company currently under fire for destroying Appalachian communities with mountaintop coal removal, and funding an industry front group that is trying to open up roadless areas in Alaska’s valuable Tongass National Forest.Industry peers began to adopt environmental policies in 2003 to address the pressing issues of climate change, ecosystem preservation, and human rights violations.  Citigroup, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Goldman Sachs have all become early adapters to a sustainable economics model being reflected in countries around the world.  Policies include innovative approaches including a designation of no-go zones for the world’s most vulnerable ecosystems, carbon accounting and commitments to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and advocating for federal regulation on climate change.The activities surrounding Wells Fargo’s AGM today follow a week of outdoor advertisements and actions. Thousands of posters reading Wells Fargo: Lootin’ and Pollutin’ Since 1852 began appearing throughout the Bay Area last Monday.  Additionally, activists organized Earth Day protests on Saturday in Western states where Wells Fargo operates to demand that Wells Fargo start respecting human rights, indigenous communities, and the environment.Wells Fargo in Coal CountryWells Fargo invests hundreds of millions of dollars in rogue coal companies engaged in the wholesale decimation of Appalachian communities and ecosystems through the reckless mining practice known as mountaintop removal. Instead of financing clean, sustainable energy sources for the 21st century, Wells Fargo is bankrolling 19th century operations that produce electricity in the most polluting, most destructive ways possible. This includes playing a part in a $130 million loan deal  to Massey Energy, a brutally anti-union mining giant engaged in mountain-top removal in West Virginia, Kentucky, and Virginia (documentation available at dirtymoney.org). Massey has been the target of community protests throughout the region as a result of its destructive practices, which includes placing a waste sludge dam and coal silo adjacent to Marsh Fork Elementary School. Surveys of children show alarmingly high rates of respiratory illness, most probably because of the substantial coal dust emitted from the structure.Wells Fargo and Human Rights Abuses in PeruWells Fargo has backed Burlington Resources -recently acquired by ConocoPhillips-, a Houston-based oil company with plans to explore for oil in three highly controversial oil concessions in remote Amazon regions of Ecuador and Peru. These concessions were carved out of the traditional territories of four indigenous nations: the Shuar, Achuar, Kichwa, and Zâ’para’ despite the strong community opposition to oil development on their lands. Wells Fargo longstanding business relationship with Burlington includes loans , help facilitating an investment transaction , and including millions of dollars of stock in the company in its mutual funds . Despite the controversy and human rights abuses associated with Burlington’s pursuit of Amazon oil, Wells Fargo continues to do business with this rogue corporation.Wells Fargo Clearcutting Paradise- The TongassThe Tongass is the largest tract of intact temperate rainforest in the world, with large areas of old-growth and undisturbed watersheds. It is North America’s last refuge for ancient coastal tree species, and provides habitat for rare and endangered species, such as brown bears, bald eagles, wolves, goshawks and all five Pacific salmon species.Typically out of step with modern values, Wells Fargo financed a mill that increased demand for logging in the Tongass  .

Amsterdam, Netherlands ",ING bank dumps divisive  1.7 billion paper mill project,ING ,Netherlands,Botnia pulp and paper mill ,forestry - pulp and paper,Uruguay,"
Dutch banking giant ING announced in a letter to Friends of the Earth International, CEDHA and  BankTrack that it is pulling out of a divisive venture opposed by environmentalists and local communities in Uruguay and Argentina. The ING Group wrote in an April 12 letter that its participation in the 1.7 billion USD controversial paper mill project of Finnish company Botnia in Uruguay ""is no longer under consideration"".  The ING Group had an advisory role to the company and was to arrange a  USD 480 million loan package from private banks for the project. The   paper mill has been strongly criticized in Uruguay and Argentina for its severe negative environmental impacts. Botnia has already started to build a paper mill on the Uruguay river, at the border with Argentina. The project will have strong environmental impacts as it will pollute air and water and contribute to the increase in damaging monoculture plantations.  The project has led to hot protests in both countries. Activists built roadblocks on bridges across the river linking the two countries. The project also brought relations between the governments of Argentina and Uruguay to a breaking point, with both governments indicating that they want to bring the case to the International Court of Justice in the Hague for violation of an international treaty governing the Uruguay river. Friends of the Earth International, Center for Human Rights and Environment (CEDHA, from Argentina) and BankTrack told ING that they were going to inform the ING shareholders meeting on April 25, 2006 about the negative impacts of the project. Just two weeks before the ING shareholders meeting, ING informed the three organizations in an April 12 letter that ""ING´s advisory and coordinating role has been concluded ... and further participation in the process - whereby funds would be made available to the project - is no longer under consideration"". According to Daniel Taillant from CEDHA ""This decision is another serious blow for Botnia. Recently the International Finance Corporation, the private arm of the World Bank, announced that it would postpone consideration of loans to the paper mill project until new identified shortcomings of the environmental and social impact studies could be addressed"". ""We are pleased to see that ING has decided not to finance this controversial project. The paper mill constitutes a clear violation of the Equator Principles for private investments which ING signed on to,"" according to Paul de Clerck of Friends of the Earth International. ""The paper mill is exactly the sort of project that should not pass the Equator Principles test. At a time when major banks debate a revision of the Equator Principles it is a very welcome signal that ING took its social and environmental responsibilities seriously"" said Johan Frijns, coordinator of BankTrack.-------------------------------------- "

United Kingdom ",UK’s largest ethical bank won’t touch World Bank private sector bonds,The co-operative bank ,United Kingdom,,,,"
Leading development and environment NGOs, including Christian Aid and Friends of the Earth, have today welcomed the commitment by The Co-operative Bank to hold no investments in the World Bank’s private sector arm, the International Finance Corporation (IFC).  
It is understood that the Co-operative Bank had become increasingly concerned about the IFC’s commitment to fossil fuel extraction and its failure to provide meaningful investment for renewable energy projects.  Industry monitors estimate that in 2005 IFC was the world’s largest multilateral financier of fossil fuel extraction.  Meanwhile, the agency devoted a mere 4% of its total energy lending to renewables in the past year, and has set no concrete goals for increasing such financing.  
“We are very pleased at The Co-operative Bank’s action.  Climate change is the single greatest threat facing the planet.  Yet the IFC uses public funds to subsidise rich oil giants who exploit fossil fuel resources in developing countries,” said Tony Juniper, Executive Director of Friends of the Earth.
“We’ve looked at the recent investments of the World Bank’s IFC and concluded that there is an unhealthy focus on fossil fuel technologies. Henceforth, we will withhold investments until such time as renewable technologies are much better supported”, said Paul Monaghan, Head of Sustainable Development, at The Co-operative Bank.
The IFC – a publicly-backed development institution – is consistently unable to show evidence that its investments in oil, gas and mining have positive impacts on poverty alleviation.  “Poor people are on the frontline of climate change and yet the IFC continues to pump public money into fossil fuel projects on their doorstep. Not only is this immensely ironic but these projects themselves are so often also a source of misery to the poor communities living around them,” added Andrew Pendleton of Christian Aid (1).
The Bretton Woods Project (2), a watchdog of the World Bank and IMF, believes the timing of the announcement is significant.  “The IFC has just finished systematically weakening the environmental and social safeguards which act as standards for private finance (3).  It has abandoned any pretension to a leadership role in the debate over the role of private finance in development,” said Project Coordinator Jeff Powell.  “We hope this decision by The Co-op will lead other banks to look again at their holdings.  This is what it will take to force the IFC into a fundamental re-think of their failed development model.”

Belgium ",Belgian campaign puts banks under pressure to stop investing in Burma,Belfius ,Belgium,,,,"
The Burmese democrats call on Belgian Banks to disinvest from companies in Birma. They claim these investments offer a substantial moral and financial support to the military regime, notorious for its systematic violations of human rights. 
A recent Netwerk Vlaanderen (B) Report revealed the links between the five biggest financial groups in Belgium (KBC, Dexia, Fortis, ING and AXA) and companies with activities in Burma. The conclusions of the report were well covered in the press and lead to talks with the banks about their investment policies. One bank, the KBC, has since then decided to exclude Total from its ethical investment portfolios.
This new campaign ‘Municipalities for Burma’ asks all Belgian municipalities to support the Burmese democrats and to put pressure on their banks to disinvest from Birma.
This campaign is launched by Actions Birmanie, a solidarity committee for Burmese democrats, Réseau Financement Alternatif and Netwerk Vlaanderen, two organisations promoting sustainable investments.
During a press conference in the Brussels City Hall, The Burmese democrat Aung Maw Zin handed over this call to action to Bruno de Lille, member of the Brussels City Council, responsable for international solidarity. During a second press conference in Ottignies, Aung presented the campaign to the mayor of Ottignies. The City of Brussels and the municipality of Ottignies have already declared Aung San Suu Kyi Citizen of Honour. The organisers asked Ottignies and Brussels to take a further step by joining the campaign ‘Municipalities for Burma’.

Brussels, Belgium ",ING and AXA invest in the modernisation of white phosphorus weapons,ING ,Netherlands,,,,"
Press release Netwerk Vlaanderen
On 18th and 19th March, millions of people will take to the streets to oppose the war and occupation in Iraq. Demonstrations are planned in no less than 208 cities around the world, including New York, London, Jakarta, Sao Paulo and Brussels. The protests oppose, amongst other things, the use of “dirty weapons” in the war. One example is the US attack on Fallujah in November 2004, where the use of white phosphorus caused many civilian casualties. Since then, work has begun on the modernisation of the factory that makes white phosphorus weapons for the US armed forces.Research from the organisations involved in the campaign “My Money. Clear Conscience?”  reveals that AXA and ING invest a combined total of $37 million in two companies responsible for renewing the production facilities for white phosphorus.
AXA and ING are playing with fireNetwerk Vlaanderen and its partners today reveal that two international bank groups AXA and ING invest a combined total of $37 million in Teledyne Technologies and The Shaw Group. As we speak these two companies are modernising the white Phosphorous factory of the US army. Military use of white phosphorus is very controversial and has caused numerous civilian casulaties in Fallujah. The investment of AXA Group in such practices is unfortunately not surprising. AXA group still has no policy regarding investment in weapons, and continues to invest in the producers of even the most controversial of weapons.ING Group has already partly withdrawn from anti-personnel mines, cluster bombs, uranium weapons, biological, chemical and nuclear weapons. These investments in white phosphorus indicate the risks that banks take if they do not fully withdraw from the arms industry. Time and time again, investments will involve them in absolutely unacceptable practices, weapons or weapon sales.
New white phosphorus ammunition for the US armed forcesThe white phosphorus weapons used by the US armed forces were produced by soldiers at the Pine Bluff Arsenal in Arkansas. Two US companies Shaw Environmental Inc. and Teledyne Brown Engineering  were awarded a contract in September 2005 and October 2005 to completely modernise the white phosphorus plant. They will be responsible for the design, assembly, integration, delivery and testing of a system for filling munitions with white phosphorus. Work will be completed by January 2007. These two companies are therefore involved in the production of new phosphorus weapons, and in this way are involved in the preparation for new war crimes against civilians.
Fallujah, an horrific storyIn November 2004 the United States carried out a relentless attack on Fallujah, a city 70 km to the west of Baghdad, and a stronghold of the Sunni resistance to the occupation. At the time of the attack, there were between 50,000 and 100,000 people in the city. The US estimated that this included between 1,000 and 6,000 insurgents. At the end of January 2005, reports of the use of white phosphorus in the attack on Fallujah began to take on serious proportions. The US only admitted to the use of white phosphorus after the release of a shocking documentary on this subject by the Italian broadcaster RAI. Reports from US soldiers make it clear that these weapons were used directly against people. To say that the impact on the civilian population was terrible, is an understatement. Jeff Englehart, a US soldier who served in Fallujah reports how he heard the order for the use of white phosphorus on the military radio. He describes the consequences as follows: “Burned. Burned bodies. I mean, it burned children, and it burned women. White phosphorus kills indiscriminately… And when it makes contact with skin, then it's absolutely irreversible damage, burning of flesh to the bone.” 
White phosphorus munitions: an attack on humanityWhite phosphorus (WP) is a substance that can be used in a wide range of ammunition. It is often used to produce light or smoke. When the ammunition detonates, it produces a large amount of heat, combined with a yellow flame and a thick white smoke. White phosphorus is also extremely toxic for humans, and in military use humans can be exposed to large doses. Exposure to WP causes serious burns, that can burn flesh to the bone. The inhalation of WP also leads to serious health effects or death. When WP munitions are used in densely populated areas, it is impossible to avoid civilian casualties. The highly toxic phosphorus cloud spreads over a large area, contaminating the air, ground and water. The military use of white phosphorus is also in breach of International Humanitarian Law.

Paris, France ",New report FoE France : Banques et environnement: Presque tout reste à faire,Belfius ,Belgium,,,,"
Friends of the Earth France published a new report today highlighting the absence of effective environmental policy within eight of the biggest French banks. As a consequence, Friends of the Earth is asking for a reinforcement of the Reporting Law and the implementation of specific environmental policies within banks, especially regarding their indirect environmental impacts.
“Banques françaises et environnement: Presque tout à faire” is the first report of its kind being launched in . It analyses banks environmental policies according to four main criteria: environmental management system, environmental policy evaluation system, direct environmental impacts and indirect environmental impacts (investment and finance policies). 
The report emphasizes four major elements:

Secrecy is the      rule, transparency the exception: An uncompromising law is highly needed
The most      worrying findings are with the finance and investment policies, which are      in general very weak though their environmental impacts are high.
Environmental      objectives are hazy and not ambitious enough
Finally,      in-house environmental training is scarce 

Sebastien Godinot of Friends of the Earth says “At the end of the day, one cannot really tell which banks are the best regarding environmental policies, but rather which banks are better than others, when referring to their own practices and commitments ”
On a scale ranging from 1 to 10, 4 bank groups distinguish themselves: HSBC, Dexia and Groupe Banque Populaire (2.6 to 2.9/10), then Sociéte Générale, Crédit Agricole and BNP-Paribas (1.7 to 2), followed by Caisse d’Epargne (1.3) and Crédit Mutuel-CIC (0.2). 
Sebastien Godinot adds: “Our report introduces many good practices, both from French and international financial institutions and emphasizes the best international norms banks should follow. If banks really wish to improve, they should be inspired by this report and implement the norms as of this year. We will follow up on that closely.”

London ",Banks warned of liability if Baku-Ceyhan pipeline leaks,ABN AMRO ,Netherlands,Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline ,oil and gas,Azerbaijan,"
The fifteen major banks that financed the controversial Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline have been warned that they could face court if the pipeline leaks. The banks, including Royal Bank of Scotland and ABN AMRO, would be liable if they had knowledge of a potential cause of pipeline failure, yet failed to act to remove the risk of pollution. The warning to the boards and legal departments of the fifteen banks came in a letter from UK, Georgian and Azeri campaign groups who have been monitoring the pipeline's impacts.   Several months behind schedule, BP's $3.3bn pipeline runs from Baku in Azerbaijan through Georgia to Ceyhan on Turkey's Mediterranean coast. Experts have testified that the anti-corrosion coating chosen by BP does not stick to the pipeline. Widespread peeling and cracking of the coating has already been reported in internal BP reports.  The participating banks could incur civil or criminal liabilities if a coating failure causes a leak. The letter informs the banks of reports documenting the extent of coating failure and puts them on notice of the potential civil and criminal liabilities that might arise if they fail to use their powers as lenders to take effective action to prevent pollution. It is an offence to “knowingly permit” a crime.  Corrosion experts have advised that the only course of action that would remove the high risks (and potential liabilities) of a leak would be for the pipeline to be re-coated with a coating that is fit for the purpose.  The campaign groups have compiled a dossier that they will make available to any claimants in Azerbaijan and Georgia seeking damages if the pipeline ruptures.  ""The directors of these private banks may not be aware of their liabilities in this project,"" says Nicholas Hildyard of The Corner House. ""Now they have been informed, we hope that they will exercise their duty to take appropriate action.""  “Royal Bank of Scotland and the other banks have turned a blind eye to systemic construction failures on BTC,” says Mika Minio-Paluello of PLATFORM. “Inaction could come back to haunt them in court.” "

Davos, Switzerland ",New WWF-BankTrack report: Shaping the Future of Sustainable Finance,Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation ,Japan,,,,"
A new study released by BankTrack and WWF today has found that there is a growing commitment to sustainable banking within the international banking sector. However, the report also highlighted the need for the sector to adopt more transparent financing policies, advancing sustainability while helping to reduce their exposure to risk. 
The report, Shaping the Future of Sustainable Finance: Moving the Banking Sector from Promises to Performance, ranked the financing policies of 39 international banks across 13 issue areas, from climate change to human rights.  The study also benchmarked the banks’ policies against international norms, and found that banks are failing to uphold environmental and social standards developed by UN agencies and other international bodies.
One of the foundations of sustainability is transparency and the report found a near total lack of publicly available information. The world has moved on from “trust me” to “show me” and without transparency even the more progressive banks leave themselves vulnerable to charges of “greenwash”.
Robert Napier, WWF-UK Chief Executive, said: “This report shows that whilst there has been some good work done by a few of the banks to develop policies the whole sector still has a long way to go. The lack of transparent policies can not only result in over-exploitation of environmental goods such as fisheries and forests but also in increased financial risk to the banks, resulting in transactions being jeopardised.”
“The first step on the way to sustainable banking is to increase the transparency of the banks’ policies,” said Jules Peck, WWF Global Policy Officer.  “This report clearly sets out international standards for 13 issue areas and acts as a challenge to the banks to improve their performance. Generally banks in this report have vaguely worded policies, which include limited commitments, and fail to meet international standards, even those leading the rankings.”
Of the 39 banks surveyed, the report only found two cases where bank policies meet all or most of the relevant international standards or best practices, Rabobank’s adoption of the UN Draft Norms on Human Rights and HSBC’s adoption of the World Commission on Dams standards.  The study also found that no bank has standards for fisheries and agriculture; only one bank has a policy specifically for dams (HSBC), extractive industries (ABN AMRO) and chemicals (HSBC); and that the vast majority of banks have no human rights guidelines.
 “This study shows that the banks have some real blind spots when it comes to sustainability.  Only eight banks – or 20 per cent of those surveyed – have a human rights policy, which is a huge gap given the importance of this issue,” said Johan Frijns, coordinator of BankTrack, an international network of advocacy NGOs monitoring the finance sector.  “Before the banking sector congratulates itself too much for its successes it should take a hard look at this report and tackle those problem areas where progress is urgently needed.”
The study also serves as a reality check for the banks which have adopted the Equator Principles, a set of project finance policies based on the International Finance Corporation standards.
“This report shows the Equator Principles clearly cannot be considered best practice,” said Michelle Chan-Fishel of Friends of the Earth – US, who noted that banks adopting only the Equator Principles earned lower-than-average rankings. “First, the Equator Principles have always been weak in some areas, such as human rights.  Second, this report identifies several examples where individual banks’ environmental and social policies go far beyond the Equator Principles in substance and scope.”  
Finally, because public information was limited, the report only benchmarks the quality of the financing standards themselves, but does not attempt to evaluate their implementation or their effect.
“Good environmental and social standards on paper mean nothing if they ultimately do not make a positive difference in people’s lives,” said Andreas Missbach of Berne Declaration.  “It is worrying that ABN AMRO, as one of the highest ranked banks, is involved in Shell’s highly destructive Sakhalin II oil and gas project along with lower-scoring ones like Credit Suisse.”

Supporting Statements
Niall O'Shea, Responsible Shareholding Analyst, Co-operative Insurance Society, UK (investor in about half of the Equator Principles banks):  “CIS endorses the view  expressed in the WWF-UK report that while a few banks are taking a  leadership role, the majority have yet to demonstrate that they are living up to their Equator Principles commitments. This is because of a lack of joined up disclosure and of adequate accountability mechanisms. The current revision of the Principles is an opportunity for the banks to convince stakeholders they intend to be judged by their actions in a way that is transparent and comparable.”
Paul Q. Watchman. Partner at international law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and recognised expert on banking: “The report marks a new maturity and objectivity in the work of the NGO community. This is an important report and WWF and BankTrack are to be congratulated for methodically peeling away the rhetoric and collective epiphany of the banking community and focusing on the reality of what is being done by the banks to discharge their new found social and environmental responsibilities. For some banks it makes surprising, and I suspect for Chairmen and CEOs of a number of leading banks, unpalatable reading.  For some banks the lack of progress made since becoming an Equator Bank in terms of policy development or transparency must in some cases be galling and in others deeply disappointing. It will come as no surprise for those that know the project finance market that ABN AMRO and HSBC were leaders of the pack. However, there is little room for smugness on their part as what is truly surprising is how little effort they had to make to come top of the class, both were D+, the fourth lowest grade. Equally disappointing was the finding that over 50 per cent of the banks reviewed scored the lowest category, E. If this was the European Song Contest the singers would be put out of their misery by pulling the plug from the socket.  Not unnaturally after almost 3 years of the Equator Banks talking a good game, like Jerry Maguire’s client the NGO community has begun to lose patience with talk and want the banks to “show them the money.”   The banks should not see this as a threat but rise to the challenge set out in this outstanding report. Looking at the highly rated policies of the leading banks in the key social and environmental areas is a reasonable place to start. However, more fundamentally it is worth asking the question why 35 of the banks reviewed do not have a policy on the extractive industries or 31 of them do not have a policy on human rights. If WWF and BankTrack achieve nothing else they will have caused a lot of very important financial institutions to re-consider their position. Time, as they say in the movies, to see which of them will be able to walk the walk as well as talk the talk. My bet is that a number of Equator Bank Chairmen, such as Charles Prince at Citi and Sir John Bond at HSBC, will be kitting out their teams with running shoes.”

Brussels, Belgium ",Belgian bank groups invest in companies that abuse human rights,Belfius ,Belgium,,,,"
AXA, ING, Fortis, Dexia and KBC have invested more than US$ 8 billion (more than €6.6 billion) in companies that are involved in the violations of human rights. That is the conclusion of research from Netwerk Vlaanderen, the results of which are published today. The companies and projects that the banks invest in have been criticised due to practices such as support for dictatorial regimes, forced relocations of population, and forced labour.
The report from Netwerk Vlaanderen ""Where do you draw the line? Research into the financial links between five bank groups and companies that abuse human rights"", reveals investments in fourteen controversial companies and a number of large-scale infrastructure projects. Netwerk Vlaanderen researched the official investment policies of the banks, and puts this into contrast with the facts.
This research report forms part of the campaign ""My Money. Clear Conscience?"". This campaign, run by Netwerk Vlaanderen, aims to point out to banks where their social responsibility lies. My Money. Clear Conscience? calls on the banks to end their controversial investments, and to make public which companies are financed with the money of their clients.
 
Support for dictatorships
The five researched banks invest a combined total of almost US$ 2.4 billion in shares of Total. Total currently has investments in a gas pipeline in Burma, a land that is ruled with an iron fist by a military junta. Total refuses to pay attention to the international call for disinvestment. The company uses Burmese soldiers, known for their extreme brutality, to clear and protect the route of the pipeline. This Total project ensures a substantial income for the military rulers of the country. The oppression of the local population is strengthened by the activities of Total.
Aung San Suu Kyi, leader of the democratic opposition and winner of the Nobel peace prize, has referred to Total as the greatest supporter of the military dictatorship in Burma.
However, the Belgian banks that were the subject of this research appear to have no problem with investing in this company.
 Violations of the rights of workers
The five researched bank groups have invested a combined total of more than US$ 1.6 billion in Wal-Mart. This US distribution chain is widely known for its continued breaches of basic workers’ rights. Wal-Mart has been condemned for breaching the child labour laws in its warehouses. In the United States there are still dozens of cases pending against the company for 'union-busting'. The management registers, threatens and illegally fires trade union activists. Trade unions are not welcomed by Wal-Mart, and Wal-Mart has already been found guilty of ‘union busting’ on a number of occasions. Poor conditions are also routine in the subcontractors of Wal-Mart, which advertises itself using the slogan ‘Always Low Prices’.
Wal-Mart doesn't seem to take much notice of these criticisms. The company has taken hardly any action to improve these terrible working conditions. Wal-Mart continues to be far behind other companies in this respect. However, the five researched banks believe that investing in Wal-Mart is perfectly reasonable.
Human rights abuses related to infrastructure projects KBC, Fortis, Dexia and ING are also heavily involved in large-scale projects that have been linked to human rights abuses. One example of this is the BTC pipeline, that runs through Turkey, Azerbaijan and Georgia. The project has been called into question because of the support for undemocratic regimes, the fuelling of regional conflicts, the violation of human rights, and environmental damage. Many communities protested against these practices, but the protests were heavily repressed in all three countries. The consultation with the effected communities left a lot to be desired. Those making their criticisms of the pipeline public were often the target of serious repression, arrest and intimidation by the authorities. This is not surprising given the human rights situation in each of the countries. Despite these problems, banks including KBC, ING and Dexia see no problem in financing the BTC project. Multiple protests against their involvement in the BTC project have been ignored.
Towards a watertight human rights policy
The examples given above are just a glimpse of the practices that are revealed in the Netwerk Vlaanderen report ""Where do you draw the line?"". The following conclusion can be drawn from the findings of the report: The polices of AXA, Dexia, Fortis, ING and KBC offer no guarantees against investments in the violation of human rights.
Netwerk Vlaanderen asks that the bank groups investigate and put an end to their investments in companies that are accused of serious breaches of human rights.
Savers and investors cannot judge the human rights profile of their bank group without clear information. Therefore, Netwerk Vlaanderen also demands that the banks make their human rights policies public, along with a list of the companies and governments in which they are investing.
The complete report goes into much more detail regarding these challenges for the bank world, and gives a number of concrete steps that can be taken to achieve a more watertight human rights policy.

Davos, Switzerland ",Bankers and Oil Barons Schmooze EBRD President Lemierre at Davos,Credit Suisse ,Switzerland,Sakhalin II oil and gas project ,oil and gas,Russian Federation,"
This week a rogue’s gallery of oil barons and bankers associated with one of the world’s most controversial oil and gas projects, Sakhalin II, will be speaking, schmoozing and boozing at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Some of those coming to the WEF who are complicit in supporting the Sakhalin II project are President of European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) Jean Lemierre, Royal Dutch Shell’s Chief Executive Jeroen Van der Veen, Credit Suisse’s Chairman of the Board Walter Kielholz and CEO Oswald Grübel, and the Chairman of the Managing Board for ABN Amro Bank Rijkman Groenik.
“The theme of this conference is ‘creative imperative,’ yet there is an imperative for these men to quit creating such a mess on Sakhalin Island,” said Dmitry Lisitsyn, Chairman of Sakhalin Environment Watch.
The largest integrated oil and gas project in world, Sakhalin II in Russia threatens the critically endangered Western Gray Whale with extinction while damaging hundreds of wild salmon runs and the island’s fishing economy. Also, in July 2005, Shell disclosed that Sakhalin II has USD 10 billion in cost overruns, angering the Russian government, whose share in the profits plummeted as a result.
At this week’s meeting in Davos, Shell, Credit Suisse and ABN Amro will no doubt try to curry favor with EBRD President Lemierre: the EBRD will be deciding this spring whether it will provide public financing to Sakhalin II. While some predict a green light, EBRD has publicly acknowledged that the project falls far short of meeting the bank’s environmental policies. The rise in debate over public funding for the already-embattled Sakhalin II project has been a major blow to the reputations of the private companies backing the project: Shell, Credit Suisse, and ABN Amro. The EBRD could also get dragged over this precipice if it violates its own policies and finances the project.
“Those desperate executives will be clamoring over Lemierre like used car salesmen,” said Doug Norlen, Responsible Finance Program Director for Pacific Environment. “But he’s already test-driven this wreck. Let’s hope he knows enough to keep his wallet in his pocket.”
At the Davos meeting President Lemierre will be presenting at a panel entitled “Multilateral Development Banks (Get Their) Act Together.” “In this next act, EBRD’s role should be as a public interest hero, not as a shield for dastardly private sector villains,” said Dr. Andreas Missbach, Private Finance Programme, Berne Declaration.

London ",Complaint filed with ING and BBVA On Pulp Paper Projects in Uruguay,BBVA ,Spain,Botnia pulp and paper mill ,forestry - pulp and paper,Uruguay,"
The Center for Human Rights and Environment (CEDHA) this week filed an unprecedented compliance complaint to the ING group of the Netherlands and BBVA of Spain, for the alleged violation to the Equator Principles of two International Finance Corporation (IFC) paper pulp projects on the Argentine-Uruguayan border.  The complaint calls for the banks' attention to the IFC Compliance Advisory Ombudsman’s (CAO) recent report which sustained many of the arguments against the paper mills originally presented by CEDHA on behalf of 40,000 local stakeholders whose environment and livelihoods would be devastated by what is to be the world’s largest paper pulp production using second rate technology already phased out in Europe for 2007. CEDHA demands that both banks uphold its commitment to the Equator Principles, originally signed in 2003 by a group of investment banks committed to sustainable development, and now adhered to by over 30 international private banks, including ING and BBVA. The Equator Principles state signatory bank adherence to basic commitments to sustainable and responsible development and investment, environmental and social projection, and ground their commitments to IFC’s Environmental and Social Safeguard Policies. Given the CAO’s findings that the IFC’s pulp mill projects in Uruguay violate IFC environmental and social safeguards, that proper consultation with stakeholders did not occur (a key element of the Equator Principles), and the many accusations faced by these projects of violations of international law, CEDHA requests that ING and BBVA suspend all consideration of financing these projects, initiate internal investigations into the Equator Principle Compliance Complaint allegations, and that it adhere to the CAO recommendations. Furthermore, CEDHA asks ING and BBVA to publicly inform clients, customers, stakeholders and the general public on its position with respect to the suspension (or otherwise) of consideration of financing the projects. As a global citizen responsible for promoting responsible environmental stewardship and socially responsible development, and as a signatory to the Equator Principles, ING and BBVA have a moral, ethical and professional obligation to uphold its commitment to the Equator Principles and must respond to stakeholder and public complaints and concerns over its projects.BankTrack fully supports both claims and works with CEDHA to seek an adequate response from both banks.

San Fransisco ",Goldman Sachs addressing environmental and social issues,Goldman Sachs ,United States,,,,"
BankTrack members Rainforest Action Network and Friends of the Earth US today commended Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) for being the first global investment bank to adopt a comprehensive environmental policy. The policy acknowledges the scientific consensus on climate change and calls for urgent action by public policy makers and federal regulators to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  The policy is also the first in the financial sector to acknowledge the degradation of global “ecosystems services” addressed in the United Nations’ Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA). Ecosystem services include the provision of water and food, control of pests and pathogens, renewal of fertile soil, control of floods, and more. The MA’s findings that two-thirds of these services are being degraded present real challenges as well as opportunities for business.  In another industry precedent, Goldman Sachs will establish and fund a Center for Environmental Markets in partnership with academia and civil society. The center will engage in research to develop public policy options for establishing markets around climate change, biodiversity conversation and ecosystem services. Recognizing that climate change cannot successfully be addressed through voluntary action alone, the firm has also committed to promote regulatory solutions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  As a major owner and operator of fossil fuel-fired power plants in the United States, Goldman Sachs has agreed to publicly report and work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from its plants while also supporting the need for a national policy to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The policy states that its investment businesses will “take the lead in identifying investment opportunities in renewable energy” and that it will “be a leading U.S. wind energy developer and generator.” It further promises to promote green building standards such as LEED Gold and Forest Stewardship Council certification and sustainable forests with a stated preference for Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification.  Similar to recent policies from Citigroup (NYSE: C), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JMP), the firm’s commitment includes explicit prohibitions against financing or investing industrial activity in ecological no-go zones and recognizes the rights of indigenous peoples to free, prior informed consultation.  Supporting statements:  “We want to acknowledge the significance of Goldman Sach’s innovative new environmental policy and equally so the process and stakeholders that helped to create it. In stark contrast to holdouts like Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley, Hank Paulson and his executives reached out to RAN and worked closely with our team as well as other citizens groups. Goldman Sachs is helping to fill a leadership vacuum on urgent environmental and social issues in this country, and Hank’s hands-on approach is the kind of leadership we need to see a lot more of in the corporate sector. Climate change and the degradation of ecosystems services threaten the health our planet and our economy, and this is the beginning of a long term transformative process, not just for Goldman Sachs but for our economy.” Michael Brune, executive director of Rainforest Action Network.  “Last year’s extreme weather broadcast the real faces and lives of the millions of people already suffering from the devastation of a destabilized climate. Finally, the corporate sector has begun to grapple with the wide range of ethical and economic consequences caused by stronger hurricanes, extended droughts, and widespread heat waves. Goldman Sachs’ new environmental policy sends a strong signal that a healthy marketplace is dependent upon ecological stability. The real impacts of global climate destabilization are raising investment risks and creating uncertainty like nothing industry has ever experienced before. Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and now Goldman Sachs are moving beyond weather derivatives to real solutions. The magnitude of the challenge to stabilize our climate and restore our biosphere requires creativity and innovation around reconciling our economy with ecological realities.” Ilyse Hogue, director of the Global Finance Campaign at Rainforest Action Network  “The emphasis of the Goldman Sachs environmental policy on climate change, biodiversity, and forests should be commended, but what is perhaps most striking is that this is the first-ever policy among financial institutions to include goals related to the conservation of “ecosystem services”; that is, the benefits we obtain from ecosystems such as clean water, flood control, pest regulation, and disease regulation. The UN-sponsored Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, released earlier this year, emphasized the perilous state of many of these “life support” services. By steering investments in ways that avoid harm to ecosystem service and by helping to create new markets that would promote the conservation of these services, Goldman Sach’s policy will help to align the power of markets with the conservation of these services.” Dr. Walter Reid, Professor, Stanford Institute for the Environment; former Director, Millennium Ecosystem Assessment  “The globe is warming … faster than anyone projected, and ocean heating is causing the climate to change. In just two decades damages from weather extremes have skyrocketed 50-fold. Today’s announcement from Goldman Sachs signals a readiness in the financial sector to advocate for public policies that enable substantial changes in their practices, programs and products and those of their clients and suppliers. A comprehensive public/private partnership, writ large, with significant incentives and regulations (‘carrots and sticks’), can make the clean energy transition a plus for public health, international security, economic growth and climate stability. Paul R. Epstein, MD, Center for Health & the Global Environment, Harvard Medical School  “Goldman Sachs is taking a courageous step by acknowledging what many policy experts have long understood. Markets alone cannot satisfy nature's demand for a rapid global switch to clean energy. Companies need the governments of the world to help regulate that transition to ensure that no individual company loses market share or incurs any competitive disadvantage. Given that reality, today's announcement by Goldman Sachs is a significant breakthrough in laying the groundwork for an energy transition that will, hopefully, offset the most disruptive impacts of intensifying climate change.” Ross Gelbspan, author, The Heat is On (1997), Boiling Point (2004)  “Forest Stewardship Council has developed the world's leading system for forest management certification based on rigorous standards, third-party audits, and a transparent and inclusive process. We are extremely pleased that Rainforest Action Network recognizes the value of the FSC system as a tool in helping to accomplish their mission of protecting the rainforest through marketplace transformation. As a result of their work with RAN, Goldman Sachs can now offer assurance to their clients that their investments will support only sound and verifiable forest management practices, with the support of the world's leading environmental organizations behind them. After receiving the first annual Designing & Building with FSC Award earlier this month for their inclusion of FSC-certified wood products in their new building in Jersey City, FSC is very excited that Goldman Sachs has furthered their commitment to forest conservation with the implementation of this new policy.” Roger C.

Cordoba, Argentina ",Uruguay paper mills run into trouble,,,Botnia pulp and paper mill ,forestry - pulp and paper,Uruguay,"
A new investor briefing by the Center for Human Rights and the Environment (CEDHA) of Argentina and BankTrack warns investors of the risks associated with getting involved in the financing of two paper mills in Uruguay.  ENCE of Spain and Botnia of Finland, two of the largest paper pulp producers in the world, are slated to make an investment in  Uruguay of nearly 2 billion US dollars, to create what would be the world’s largest existing pulp production enterprise.   According to CEDHA, the two planned plants will cause numerous environmental and social problems such as the pollution of potable water sources and increase of health problems as a result of the release of toxics, destruction of local tourism due to contamination and foul smell and uprooting of communities and loss of biodiversity as a result of expansion of eucalyptus plantations.

Amsterdam, Netherlands ",ABN AMRO wins Hypocricy Award,ABN AMRO ,Netherlands,Sakhalin II oil and gas project ,oil and gas,Russian Federation,"
ABN AMRO has been awarded the 'Schone Schijn Award' (Hypocricy Award) at a glamorous event organised by Milieudefensie - Friends of the Earth Netherlands (a member of BankTrack).   ABN AMRO received the award for being one of the lead banks in financing environmentally and socially disruptive oil and gas projects such as the Chad-Cameroon and the Baku Ceyhan oil pipelines.  Milieudefensie singled out the interest expressed by ABN AMRO -and several other Equator banks- to finance the huge Sakhalin II oil and gas project in the Russian Far East as especially worriesome, given the well documented social and environmental risks posed by this project.   According to Milieudefensie, financing such projects is incompatible with a good faith application of the Equator Principles and makes a mockery of the claim of the bank to have robust environmental policies and screening procedures in place.  ABN AMRO, present at the award ceremony, insisted that the key problem is not with companies such as ABN AMRO but with filaing local governments. It refused to accept the prize but took it home 'to keep its staff on alert'. "

Brussels ",Demining team begin their work at AXA,,,,,,"
Activists from the campaign “My Money. Clear Conscience?” today symbolically demined the headquarters of AXA in Brussels. A landmine clearance team went in search of landmines, cluster munitions and other controversial weapons. This action is needed more than ever, as research from Netwerk Vlaanderen reveals that AXA invests heavily in two new US landmine producers.  New landmines in the United States... Last year George W. Bush made a significant change in the direction of the landmine policy of the United States. Instead of keeping the promise to sign the Ottawa Treaty (the international treaty banning anti-personnel landmines) in 2006, Bush has opted to renew the production and use landmines for the US army. Companies such as Textron and ATK have already received large sums of money for the development of these weapons, and hope to receive the green light from the Pentagon in December to begin production.  ... with investment from AXA Netwerk Vlaanderen reveals today that the financial group AXA is investing heavily in ATK and especially in Textron. AXA's investments in Textron- both direct and via investment funds- account for no less than 28.84% of the shares in the company. The shares in ATK and Textron are worth more than $2.7 billion.  After three years of campaigning against investments in the weapon industry by AXA, Dexia, Fortis, ING and KBC, Netwerk Vlaanderen shows once again that AXA is lagging hopelessly behind the other financial groups when it comes to taking social responsibility for investments. While the other four banks have started to work on stricter policies for investment in weapon producers AXA still sees no problem with investing in anti-personnel landmines.  Evidence that another policy can be followed can be found with KBC. This bank group already decided in August 2005 that Textron should be put on the black list of companies that are excluded from investments. ATK and other producer of cluster munitions, landmines and uranium weapons have been on this list since 2004.  Landmines are the pariahs of the weapon world Landmines create primarily civilian victims, a large number of which are children. Since 1975 there have already been 1 million victims of landmines. Victims that survive must cope for the rest of their lives with severe injuries and amputated limbs. Since 1997 there has been a treaty banning anti-personnel mines, the Ottawa Treaty. Through the success of this treaty, anti-personnel mines are already banned in over ¾ of the world. Belgium played a pioneering role in bringing this treaty into being.  The demining team from the campaign “My Money. Clear Conscience?” demands that AXA group immediately ends her investment in landmine producers.  See Pictures here "

San Fransisco ",Corporate reform campaign in US targets Wells Fargo,,,,,,"
The Global Finance Campaign of Rainforest Action Network today announced that organizers would begin activating its grassroots network to prepare for a sustained campaign to reform Wells Fargo.
Over one hundred environmental and social justice activists launched the effort by marching backwards at noon through San Francisco's financial district to the banks landmark Montgomery Street branch and unfurling a giant third story-banner reading 'Wells Fargo: Lootin' and Pollutin' since 1852'? to draw attention to the out-dated practices of America's most backwards bank.?       Despite persistent pleas from citizen action groups, Wells Fargo has refused to incorporate new industry best practices on the environment recently adopted by Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase.   Instead, in a move straight out of the book 'Managing Activism: A Guide to Dealing with Activists and Pressure Groups',? the bank responded this summer by launching a public relations campaign to promote a 10-Point Environmental Commitment ?that made no mention of global warming, endangered ecosystems or human rights.    In stark contrast to similar policy announcements made by fellow CEOs, Wells Fargo chief executive Richard M. Kovacevich was notably AWOL from his bank's statement leaving stakeholders feeling deserted by his lack of leadership on these issues.       In a September 21 letter, Rainforest Action Network executive director Michael Brune called on Mr. Kovacevich to phase out funding for extractive industries in intact forests and endangered ecosystems, reduce both direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, cancel oppressive third world debt, support the rights of indigenous nations and local communities to free and prior informed consent, require Forest Stewardship Council chain-of-custody certification, prioritize funding for sustainable forest management and renewable clean energy, provide retail products that promote home and auto energy efficiency, finance affordable housing near public transportation and prioritize funding for companies that have audited and accounted for use of ecosystems services.   With $435 billion in assets and over 23 million customers, Wells Fargo is the largest US-based bank still operating without comprehensive modern guidelines to govern its investment practices and corporate conduct on a broad range of urgent environmental and social issues.   Case studies published today on DirtyMoney.org show how Wells Fargo supports radical extraction practices like clear-cutting forests and leveling mountaintops, often on public land for private profit.   'The Wells Fargo wagon is stuck in the past',? said Ilyse Hogue, director of the Global Finance Campaign at Rainforest Action Network. 'America's three largest banks are taking their first steps toward a environmentally sustainable and socially just economy while Wells Fargo is defaulting on the defining issues of our time. We are calling on Wells Fargo executives to make issues like global warming, deforestation and the economic drivers causing them a top priority now'.? "

San Fransisco ",Activists to banks: behave better in the Boreal,Bank of Montreal (BMO) ,Canada,,,,"
ForestEthics and Rainforest Action Network sent letters to the chief executives of Canadas biggest banks asking them to cooperate with the environmental community and independent scientists to develop permanent policies that protect endangered forests, prevent climate change and promote human rights. The invitation follows similar ongoing collaborations between Rainforest Action Network and Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase that have resulted in new best practices on the environment in critical areas including endangered forest protection, sustainable forestry, illegal logging, ecological no-go zones, carbon mitigation and reduction, renewable energy and indigenous rights.  In the August 25, 2005 letter, ForestEthics executive director Todd Paglia and Rainforest Action Network executive director Michael Brune asked Canadian banks to move quickly to phase out funding of industrial extraction from intact forests and endangered ecosystems; set greenhouse gas reduction targets and timelines for direct and indirect emissions; support the right of indigenous First Nations and local communities to free and informed prior consent of bank financed projects on their lands; require independent chain-of-custody certification for forest products financing to prevent illegal logging and corporate corruption; prioritize funding for sustainable forestry certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and clean energy sources such as wind and solar; implement internal paper procurement policies that maximize post-consumer recycled content and FSC-certified virgin fiber; and eliminate procurement of products from endangered forests and controversial suppliers.  Letters were sent to the chief executives of Bank of Montreal (TSX: BMO, NYSE: BMO), Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (TSX: CM, NYSE: BCM), Royal Bank of Canada (TSX: RY, NYSE: RY), Scotiabank (TSX: BNS, NYSE: BNS), and Toronto-Dominion Bank Financial Group (TSX: TD, NYSE: TD)  A recent McAllister Opinion Research poll found that 80 percent of Canadians are concerned about the loss of wilderness forests in their province and say that industry should work with environmental groups, First Nations and local communities to develop conservation solutions rather than unilaterally determining their own best environmental practices.  The North American Boreal Perhaps the worlds greatest remaining conservation opportunity, the Boreal Forest of North America is one of the largest intact forest ecosystems left on earth. With 25% of the earths' remaining intact, road-less forests, the region supports some of the planet’s largest populations of wildlife such as grizzlies, wolves, woodland caribou and lynx. It is also the nesting grounds for one-third (3-5 billion) of our continent's songbirds and 40% of North America's ducks and other migratory water fowl. The boreal is also a key regulator of global climate and holds more freshwater in wetlands, lakes and rivers than any other place on earth.  Supporting statements ""Some of the largest financial institutions in the world like Citibank and JP Morgan Chase have already made commitments to mitigate their impacts on what is left of the Earth's wild places like the Canadian Boreal,""; commented Tzeporah Berman, Program Director for ForestEthics, ""It's time for Canadian banks to show some leadership by putting progressive policies in place and refusing to support short sighted development that threatens our remaining old growth forests.""  ""Now more than ever, the very real impact of global warming and deforestation is being felt around the world""; said Ilyse Hogue, director of The Global Finance Campaign at Rainforest Action Network. “The global marketplace is being forced to factor in the enormous risks associated with the interruption of vital services offered by Earth's few remaining intact forest ecosystems like the North American Boreal. The Boreal freely provides humanity with fresh air and pure water, serves as a critical habit during this time of unprecedented extinction, and stabilizes our increasingly fragile climate.   It is time for Canada's financial community to internalize all of the social and environmental risks associated with controversial investments like the MacKenzie Valley pipeline and Weyerhaeuser/Trout Lake clear-cuts and follow industry leaders such as Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase in setting a sustainable trajectory for the Canadian financial sector.""

Washington ",Insurers poor in assessing and disclosing risks of climate change,Allianz ,Germany,,,,"
A new report by Friends of the Earth shows that ’s property and casualty insurers are doing a very poor job in disclosing climate change-related risks in their SEC filings on material risks facing the firms. Only 5 companies out of the 106 surveyed referenced climate change issues in their SEC reporting, despite the growing body of evidence that climate change will produce increasingly intense storms.
“A growing number of companies recognize that climate change is a bottom-line issue, and are complying with SEC disclosure rules by reporting this risk to shareholders,” said Michelle Chan-Fishel, coordinator of Friends of the Earth’s Green Investments Program. “It is surprising that  property and casualty insurers, companies one would expect to be most attuned to risks associated with climate change, are not disclosing how those risks affect their business. After these companies finish paying out the claims for Hurricane Katrina, their shareholders ought to demand full disclosure of climate change risks in future SEC reports.”
Climate change-related risks facing the insurance industry include greater unpredictability and severity of severe weather events such as hurricanes, floods, and heat waves.  A report from researchers the Allianz Group and the World Wide Fund for Nature includes a Cambridge University–EU estimate that potential cumulative global damages caused by climate change could reach up to 74 trillion euros (US$ 91.8 trillion) at today’s value.  FOE also released its fourth annual survey of climate change reporting in 2004 SEC filings of major companies in five important sectors of the economy: automotive, integrated oil & gas, property & casualty insurance, petrochemicals, and electric utilities sectors.
Compared with last year, the overall rate of climate change reporting has improved, going up from 39% to 47%.  Reporting rates were best among utilities (96%) and integrated oil & gas companies (74%). But disclosure rates are poor in the automobile (26%) and petrochemicals sectors (28%), and worst among property & casualty insurers (15%).  
Almost half of the companies providing climate reporting state that global warming-related risks could indeed have a material adverse impact on the firm, even though these impacts were often difficult to estimate.  More companies are highlighting their climate change reporting by creating separate climate change sections in their SEC filings, or naming climate change as a “Key Risk” facing the firm.   One reason for this improvement may be the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. “Under Sarbanes-Oxley, corporate directors, especially audit committees, must guarantee that companies have adequate internal controls to identify, manage and disclose material risks,” said Chan-Fishel, “Boards that fail to ensure appropriate climate reporting – particularly when a company’s competitors are coming clean – may be in breach of Sarbanes-Oxley and their fiduciary duty.”  
The multi-sector survey also supports recent evidence that environmental disclosure among publicly traded companies in the  is weak.  For example, an SEC review of Fortune 500 companies’ 2001 10-K filings found that many companies did not provide adequate disclosure on environmental issues. 
The Best Climate Reporters: Electric Utilities
Today FoE also issued a companion report that specifically analyzes the climate disclosure practices of the 53 companies in the Dow Jones US Utilities Index. It found that 40 American utilities disclosed climate risks in their 2004 SEC 10-K filings, a reporting rate of 75%.  Half of the utilities provide best, good or fair reporting.  But the remaining utilities failed to report, do not adequately describe climate risks, or do not address the question of whether these risks could have an impact on the firm.   The results of this utilities study are consistent with the findings of a similar report from the Government Accountability Office.  The 2004 GAO study, which also looked at SEC reporting among electric utilities, found that “the amount and type of  information varied widely,” and that there is “considerable variation in where the disclosures were located within the filings, posing a challenge for researchers trying to find information on particular topics.”

Utrecht ",Banks urged to back off from Sakhalin II,Rabobank ,Netherlands,Sakhalin II oil and gas project ,oil and gas,Russian Federation,"
Following Shell’s announcement that its Sakhalin II project would cost $20 billion – twice the original estimate – BankTrack on July 19, 2005 sent letters to 25 banks, calling on them not to finance the project. This is the third letter that BankTrack has sent to financial institutions raising environmental and social concerns about Sakhalin II.    Shell’s announcement comes at a time when the company is seeking a financing package for Sakhalin II.  In April 2005, BankTrack sent dozens of letters to financial institutions, inquiring about their involvement in the project.  Although many banks did not reply, several, including HVB and Rabobank, stated or implied that they were not involved.  BankTrack also prepared a bank briefing outlining the environmental, social and operational risks associated with the project.  outlining the environmental, social and operational risks associated with the project, and documenting how Sakhalin II violates the Equator Principles (EPs) on numerous counts.    For example, Sakhalin II violates the Equator Principles’ Critical Natural Habitats policy, which prohibits the significant degradation of critical natural habitats; and it also violates the Indigenous Peoples policy, which requires projects to achieve the informed participation of indigenous peoples and to create of a Indigenous Peoples plan to avoid negative social impacts.

San Fransisco ",Wells Fargo Defaults On Environmental And Social Issues,,,,,,"
In response to mounting market activism, Wells Fargo, the nation’s fourth largest bank, launched an eleventh hour public relations campaign on Monday to stave off a planned protest at its San Francisco headquarters today. The protest went ahead as scheduled with consumer activists calling for “less PR and more progress” on global warming, endangered ecosystems and human rights.  Promoted as a “10-Point Environmental Commitment,” Wells Fargo’s press release had no policy to back it up, offered no implementation details and fell far short of industry best practices recently set by Bank of America, Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase. In stark contrast to policy announcements made by fellow CEOs, Wells Fargo chief executive Richard M. Kovacevich was notably AWOL from the statement leaving stakeholders feeling deserted by his lack of leadership on a range of urgent environmental and social issues.  Wells Fargo’s “environmental commitment” made no mention of global warming, ecological no-go zones or indigenous rights, and its adoption of the Equator Principles is viewed by the activist community as inherently meaningless since project finance is a negligible aspect of its business. Unlike JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo made no commitment to extend its application of the principles to include “all loans, debt and equity underwriting, financial advisories and project-linked derivative transactions.”  In addition to Wells Fargo’s poor performance on the environment, recent investigations have found bank policies and practices tantamount to economic apartheid with profits derived from social injustice and human rights abuses including predatory lending in communities of color in the United States and exploitive remittance fees for American workers sending money to their families in debt-burdened developing nations in the Global South.  Transparency statement Rainforest Action Network currently maintains four business accounts with Wells Fargo and is in the process of researching alternatives.  "

Utrecht, the Netherlands ","One Step up, challenges Ahead",,,,,,"
The Equator banks have improved their record in implementing and applying the Equator Principles but their effect on the ground remains unclear, concludes a new BankTrack report on the Equator Principles (EP), a bank-led initiative to establish common environmental and social standards for project finance that was launched two years ago.  The report, titled ‘One Step up; not time to pause, The Equator Principles at age two’,  reviews EP banks’ efforts on the implementation and application of the Principles. The review is based solely on what EP banks have publicly disclosed, as this is the only basis on which civil society is able to judge banks’ progress.The report notes some positive developments, such as the decision of six banks – ABN AMRO, Barclays, Citigroup, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, and Westpac – to expand the scope of EPs, to transactions that fall under the $50 million threshold, and/or to certain corporate loans. In addition, ABN AMRO, HSBC, ING, and Westpac all reported that the EPs played a role in the bank either declining or putting extra environmental conditions on projects.However, the report also finds that transparency regarding EP implementation has been lacking.  Although rates and quality of EP reporting have improved compared to last year, the vast majority of adopting banks (80%) provide limited or no disclosure, thus undercutting public confidence in the EPs.Also like last year, implementation of the EPs has varied greatly among banks.  While a few banks have made significant efforts, less than half reported creating new procedures, standards, tools, etc. to implement the EPs.  Moreover, it appears that at least four banks -- Banco Bradesco, BBVA, EKF, and MCC -- do not have existing systems to manage environmental/social credit risks, which reduces the ability of these institutions to “mainstream” the EPs into existing operations.“We welcome the handful of banks that are really trying to follow the ‘spirit of Equator,” but they do not offset the practices of others that have failed to demonstrate that they are even following the ‘letter of Equator’,” said Johan Frijns, coordinator of BankTrack, an international network of advocacy NGOs monitoring the financial sector.  “Unless all Equator banks provide timely evidence that they aremaking a good faith effort to implement Principles, the EPs risk becoming greenwash.”  “We are still hopeful about the Equator Principles, but our patience is wearing thin,” said Michelle Chan-Fishel of Friends of the Earth – US, a BankTrack member.  “It’s too early to tell whether the Principles improving the lives of local communities, but it’s too late for banks to still be doing business as usual.”An accompanying Statement issued by BankTrack points out that the EPs are at a critical stage: While there are some promising signs among certain Equator banks, the EPs still face accountability problems, which if remain unchecked, could create serious problems in the future. The Statement also mentions several controversial deals that will test the Principles, particularly the Sakhalin II project, which according to an earlier BankTrack study violates the EPs on several counts.BankTrack notes that two years after the EP launch, several key project finance banks, such as BNP Paribas, Societe Generale and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking continue to opt out. At the same time, the development of other environmental and social financing standards has challenged the Equator Principles’ leadership.“BankTrack has welcomed the launch of new environmental and social financing standards that have been developed in the past year,” said Frijns, referring to recent standards such as HSBC’s freshwater policy which is based on World Commission on Dams recommendations, and the weapons financing policies of KBC, ING, Dexia and Fortis.  “As banks develop new policies addressing issues like human rights or specific sectors, the Equator Principles become less of a vanguard for sustainability and more of a minimum expectation for project finance banks.” "

San Fransisco ",JP MorganChase joins efforts to curb global warming,JPMorgan Chase ,United States,,,,"
Rainforest Action Network today commended JPMorgan Chase on its adoption of a comprehensive environmental policy to address the challenges of global warming and deforestation and recognize the rights of indigenous nations.  The policy sets new best practices on the environment in several critical areas including carbon mitigation and reduction, endangered forest protection, independently certified sustainable forestry as well as land and consultation rights of native communities everywhere. It is the first policy of its kind in the financial sector to create a special heading acknowledging “No Go Zones,” a major step forward in the effort to protect ecosystems that are most valuable intact and untouched by industry.  Developed in cooperation with groups including Rainforest Action Network, the new policy marks another environmental milestone in the private financial sector and follows the adoption of similar policies by Citigroup and Bank of America last year. Major advances include:  o Global Warming: JPMorgan Chase will encourage clients to develop carbon mitigation plans that include measurement and disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions as well as plans to reduce or offset them. In a financial industry first, the bank will internalize carbon pollution for power sector projects by integrating the financial cost of greenhouse gas emissions into its analysis.  o Sustainable Forestry Certification: The policy makes JPMorgan Chase the first private bank to state a preference for Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification.  o Illegal Logging: The policy will require JPMorgan Chase clients that “process, purchase or trade” forest products from high-risk countries to have certifiable chain of custody systems in place to ensure that the wood comes from legal sources.  o Human Rights: The bank recognizes the right of indigenous individuals and communities to “self determination over issues affecting their lands and territories, traditionally owned or otherwise occupied and used.”  o Project Finance: JPMorgan Chase joins the Equator Principles, lowers the application threshold to $10 million, and broadens the scope to include “all loans, debt and equity underwriting, financial advisories and project-linked derivative transactions,” specifically naming the mining, forestry, and oil and gas industries.  o Private Equity Risk Management: The policy marks the first time that any financial institution has integrated environmental risk management into the due diligence process for its private equity divisions.  o Leadership on Public Policy: In another industry first, JPMorgan Chase has agreed to arrange cooperative meetings with other financial institutions to advocate for reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and “focus on specific projects to alter the emissions trajectory of the US economy.”  Supporting statements:  “Today, JPMorgan Chase joins a growing community of business leaders who are taking their first steps to address global climate change, forest destruction, and human rights violations,” said Ilyse Hogue, director of the Global Finance Campaign at Rainforest Action Network. “This move represents a tipping point in the private financial sector, where the three largest banks have now publicly recognized that a sound long-term economic strategy relies on embracing environmental sustainability. The rest of the commercial and investment banks need to taker larger strides to confront their role in the environmental crisis facing us.”  ""One of Wall Street's most trusted names is taking action to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions,” said Jon Sohn, Sr., an associate at the World Resources Institute. “We hope JPMorgan's stance will drive other financial institutions to curb their pollution and protect themselves from the very real business risks of global warming. WRI applauds JPMorgan's leadership demonstrated today with the release of their Sustainability Commitment. JPMorgan's commitments are a tremendous step towards harnessing financial markets to expand economic opportunity and protect the environment. The commitments made by JPMorgan reflect an exciting trend by financial institutions to develop and adopt a new generation of rules to assess the risks posed by climate, biodiversity and social impacts on their portfolios and on individual investments in companies or projects.""""  ""We want to congratulate RAN and JPMorgan Chase on reaching this agreement which will have a significant impact on the relationship between the financial service sector and the responsible management of the world's forests,” said Roger Dower, president of the Forest Stewardship Council in the United States. “We set high standards that ensure forestry is practiced in an environmentally responsible, socially beneficial, and economically viable way, and we appreciate the recognition of FSC in this agreement as a vital tool for forest certification and conservation.""  ""Over the past several years, a coalition of some institutional shareholders of J.P. Morgan Chase have asked the bank to consider the environmental risks of projects it finances,” said Steve Lippman, vice president of social research at Trillium Asset Management. “We welcome the new leadership policies the bank announced today. J.P. Morgan joins a growing number of large banks in the U.S. and around the world that recognize that avoiding unnecessary environmental risks often means avoiding business risks and that there's ways to protect shareholders and the planet at the same time. We'll stay in touch with the bank to ensure the strong and effective implementation of these new risk management policies."" "

Zurich ",CSFB Shamed For Funding Whale Extinction,,,Sakhalin II oil and gas project ,oil and gas,Russian Federation,"
Led by BANKTrack, the Berne Declaration, Greenpeace Switzerland,
Pacific Environment, Platform, Sakhalin Environment Watch and
Rainforest Action Network, NGOs are calling on Credit Suisse First
Boston (CSFB) to end its relationship as financial advisor to Sakhalin
II, the oil and gas mega-project led by Shell. Independent scientists
believe this project could push the last 100 western North Pacific gray
whales to extinction and the indigenous people of Sachalin are claiming
that it threatens their livelihood.
 Today the Berne Declaration, Greenpeace Switzerland and Sakhalin
Environment Watch held a peaceful protest outside the headquarters of
Credit Suisse Group on Zurich Paradeplatz, whose centre of attention
was an 18 meter long inflatable whale. In Sachalin on the shore of
Aniva Bay, in the construction area for a Liquid Natural Gas plant
under construction, a picketing action was launched today against
dredging and spoil dumping being carried out by Shell and Sakhalin
Energy Investment Company. The protests will continue tomorrow in New
York City, where Pacific Environment and Rainforest Action Network will
protest in Madison Square Park directly across the street from the New
York headquarters of Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB).  In the press conference in Zurich today, Stefan Füglister from
Greenpeace stressed the danger that Sachalin II brings to the gray
whales: «Additional whale deaths due to the oil industry have the most
serious consequences for the population. The loss of one additional
female per year would be sufficient to drive the population towards
extinction with high probability.» Alexander Solovev, the Coordinator
of Field Projects of Sakhalin Environmental Watch witnesses the
negative effects the construction of the onshore pipeline has on the
indigenous population of Sachalin whose livelihood is depending on
fishing and reindeer herding. «For most of the 1100 water crossings,
the method of wet trenching is used, This can result in massive
sedimentation that can destroy downstream spawning beds and other
aquatic habitat», said Alexander Solovev.
 Credit Suisse First Boston is the financal advisor of Sakhalin
Energy Invesment Corporation, the Bermuda based consortium dominated by
Shell. Therefore the bank is at the moment in a key position. Most
probably CSFB will try to put together a credit consortium for Sachalin
II of other commercial banks in the coming weeks. «Credit Suisse has
signed on to the Equator Principles, a set of guidelines for
environmentally and socially responsible project finance. Their role in
the financing of Sachalin II prooves that there is a lack of
implementation of the principles at Credit Suisse. If Credit Suisse
wants to live up to their claim that they want ‘ to contribute to
sustainable development by acting in an environmentally responsible
manner', the bank should end its mandate for Sachalin II», said Andreas
Missbach, banking expert at the Berne Declaration. "

Brussels ",ING partly disinvest from controversial weapons,ING ,Netherlands,,,,"
ING, the largest private financial institution in the Benelux countries, and the 11th largest in the world, has decided to no longer invest in companies producing controversial weapons. The types of weapons excluded by ING are: anti-personnel mines, cluster bombs, depleted uranium weapons, biological, chemical and nuclear weapons. Netwerk Vlaanderen, Forum voor Vredesactie, For Mother Earth and Vrede have been campaigning since 2003 for an end to investments of Belgian banks in the arms trade. Their campaign “My Money. Clear Conscience?” has put pressure on ING to make this important step in the direction of a peaceful investment policy.   
Controversial weapons
 The weapons systems from which ING is disinvesting are indeed controversial. They make no distinction between military and civilian targets, and their use causes disproportionate suffering. Cluster bombs have been responsible over the past decades for thousands of civilian casualties, often years after the end of the conflict in which they are deployed. They were extensively used in Yugoslavia, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq.  Landmines are dirty weapons. Every year there are between 15,000 and 20,000 new victims caused by landmines. In more than 75% of the world, landmines have been declared illegal.  Nuclear Weapons are the most destructive weapons ever developed. These weapons of mass destruction continue to threaten the whole world. Despite signing treaties that commit them to disarm, the nuclear powers continue to modernise their arsenals.  Uranium weapons have been used in armed conflicts over the last 15 years, despite the fact that they are chemically toxic and radioactive. Even after the end of the conflict in which they are used, they cause serious health problems for soldiers and civilians.   
ING adopts a stricter weapon policy
ING has decided to implement strict criteria for defence-oriented companies involved in the production, maintenance, or sale of these controversial weapons. ING will no longer finance these companies, and will no longer make its own direct investments in these companies. Indirect investments are still permitted. For example, investors will still be able to purchase investment funds from ING, including shares from these companies.    
 
Big companies in the spotlight 
In a  report  published in early 2004, Netwerk Vlaanderen revealed that AXA, DEXIA, Fortis, ING and KBC all invested in producers of these controversial weapons, including some of the largest arms companies in the world. Companies that Netwerk Vlaanderen believes that ING should disinvest from include ATK, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Singapore Technologies Engineering and General Dynamics. ATK is the most important ammunition supplier for the US army, and is involved in the production of uranium weapons and cluster bombs. Lockheed Martin is the largest arms producer in the world, and produces nuclear weapons and cluster bombs, amongst other weapon systems. This new policy should lead to ING abandoning direct links with some of the largest arms companies in the world.   
Important step, but some reservations
 Netwerk Vlaanderen, Forum voor Vredesactie, For Mother Earth and Vrede applaud the step that ING has made, and hope that the other bank groups will follow this example. After KBC, which last year withdrew from a number of controversial weapon systems, ING is the second bank group to take a clear standpoint on this issue.   There are still some important omissions in the policy of ING. Netwerk Vlaanderen and its partners regret that this new policy is not valid for indirect investments made by ING. This means that producers of controversial weapons will not be removed from the investment funds that ING offers to its customers. For the customer that invests in ING funds, nothing has changed. Their money can still be invested in producers of these highly controversial weapon systems.   The new policy is clearly a step forward in the development of a peaceful investment policy. ING must now work on making this policy solid, strict and transparent. The organisations that have taken the initiative in the campaign “My money. Clear Conscience?” hope that in the future ING will apply this policy to indirect investments, and other weapon systems.

Utrecht, the Netherlands ",BankTrack Welcomes UNEP FI Plans to Weed Out “Free Riders”,,,,,,"
BankTrack warmly welcomed a recent announcement from the United Nations Environment Programme’s Financial Initiative (UNEP FI) to weed out “free riders” -- financial institutions which signed the UNEP Statement by Financial Institutions on the Environment and Sustainable Development (“UNEP Statement”), but have done little to demonstrate their commitment to the values contained therein.In a 24 February 2005 letter to all UNEP FI signatories, new UNEP FI Chairman Martin Hancock (Westpac Banking Corporation) states that “the biggest challenge will be deciding where we can add the most value to our members and the sustainability agenda”. He also warned that “there will be a concerted effort over the next six months to part company with those institutions that do not pay their requisite fees or abide by the Statements they originally signed up to. This is important if the UNEP FI brand is not to be undermined.” In 2002, after meeting with members of UNEP FI Steering Committee regarding the Initiative’s lack of accountability, thirteen NGOs wrote to UNEP Executive Director Klaus Topfer, stating, “before we consider further participation in the Initiative our principal concerns of the vetting of members and the removal of non-complying signatories needs to be addressed.”   “We welcome this step. Many NGOs have long urged UNEP FI to remove those signatories who show little commitment to these principles. This will bring more accountability and meaning to endorsing the UNEP Statement and indeed increase the relevance of UNEP FI for the sustainability agenda” said Johan Frijns, coordinator of BankTrack, an international network of NGOs monitoring investment banks.  “It’s essential that financial institutions report back regularly so they can demonstrate to the wider world they are meeting their commitments on sustainability”, said Simon McRae of BankTrack member Friends of the Earth EWNI, “The days that it was enough to merely sign on to a statement, without adding any teeth to it, are long over”.

Amsterdam, The Netherlands ","Equator Principles; Principles, Profits or just PR?",,,Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline ,oil and gas,Azerbaijan,"
One year after the launch of the Equator Principles (EP), a bank-led initiative to establish common environmental and social standards for project finance, NGOs have released an assessment on the implementation and effectiveness of the Principles so far. A new BankTrack report, titled “Principles, Profits, or Just PR? Triple P investments under the Equator Principles”, examines whether the Principles have promoted a ‘Triple P’ approach to investments, balancing People, Profit and Planet in a way that is truly sustainable, or whether they are perhaps a mere PR effort.The report examines the current situation on project, institutional and group level. Based on the limited information publicly available, it finds that generally implementation of the EPs has been poor to middling. It also concludes that despite the existence of the Principles, many controversial projects went ahead virtually unaltered.“Since the launch of the Equator Principles in June 2003, NGOs have grown increasingly impatient with the unwillingness of the banks to share information and engage with stakeholders. Due to this secrecy, it is impossible for the public or even the endorsing banks themselves to properly assess whether the Principles are being implemented or making a difference.” said Johan Frijns, coordinator of BankTrack, an international network of advocacy NGOs monitoring the Equator banks. “Every now and then the EP website heralds the signing of yet another bank onto the Principles, but we are not seeing results on the ground, nor evidence that the EP are being fully implemented by all the endorsers”The report analyzes several key transactions financed by Equator banks in the past year, such as the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline. “Both BankTrack and the Equator banks point to the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline as a key test case for Equator Principles implementation,” said Greg Muttit of UK-based PLATFORM, who analyzed how the pipeline violated the Principles on over 30 counts. “The banks claimed that the pipeline complied with the principles, but refused to say how and why. As a result, few saw the banks’ claim as credible, Now, the pipeline’s continuing ethical, legal and human rights problems clearly show the extent of the banks’ failure to apply the Principles” The report mentions several additional controversial deals financed by Equator banks, such as the Kárahnjúkar hydro project in Iceland, and flags upcoming projects as the Sahkalin II oil and gas project in the Russian Far East, the Omkareshwar dam in India and the Nam Theun II dam in Laos as a severe test case for the good faith application of the Principles.The report further describes the attempt of eleven Equator banks to block proposals designed to improve the ability of World Bank extractives investments to serve the poor. “One of the most distressing things we have seen this year is how Equator banks have formed themselves into a lobby group to block pro-poor reforms at the World Bank,” said Simon McRae of Friends of the Earth UK. “Certainly Equator banks have a right to express their own opinion, but when they band together to become obstructionists it deals a blow to their integrity”.The report provides anecdotes of strategies that individual Equator banks have employed to implement the Principles at their own institutions, and finds that there is wide variation in how banks have “mainstreamed” the Principles into their management systems.It concludes with several recommendations to restore a sense of good faith in the principles, notably the adoption of an Independent Accountability, seek active stakeholder engagement in the implementation of the EPs, be transparent on investment decisions based on the EPs and provide leadership for the continuous improvement and implementation of the Principles.“This report, and the recommendations it contains, signals that NGOs still have some hope for the Principles, and that we want to see them work,” said Michelle Chan-Fishel of BankTrack/Friends of the Earth US. “However, if the Equator banks continue to finance controversial deals, pursue an anti-environmental lobbying agenda and cloak themselves in secrecy and unaccountability, public confidence will be irretrievably lost.” "

Davos, Switzerland ",Equator Principles: no U turn allowed,,,Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline ,oil and gas,Azerbaijan,"
Non-governmental organisations present at the World Economic Forum, today called upon commercial banks not to back track on their commitment to the Equator Principles (EP). They voiced this concern as EP signatory banks intend to finance the highly controversial Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline. Since June 2003, nineteen leading banks have signed on to the Equator Principles, committing themselves to apply the social and environmental policies of the IFC, the World Bank's private arm, in all their project lending. While cautiously welcomed by NGOs as a first step in a long process leading to socially and environmentally responsible banking practices, the continued support of Equator banks for projects such as BTC has led to serious doubts about the viability of the Principles. At least eight EP banks, lead by ABN AMRO, are participating in the BTC project, which, according to NGO research, is in total or partial breach of five EP referenced IFC standards, on at least 127 counts. The organisations, who recently established the BankTrack network, presented EP banks with a elaborate list of recommendations on how to best act upon the Principles, and move beyond the limited framework they provide. The recommendations include a commitment to full information disclosure and transparency, the establishment of a joint Independent Accountability Mechanism, and moving beyond IFC standards in those sectors where these are not best practice. Andrea Baranes of CRBM, Italy commented; ""EP Bank support for BTC has put the very credibility of the Principles at stake; having such ambitions and at the same time allow for these kind of projects to continue makes them virtually meaningless"".Michelle Chan of Friends of the Earth (US) added ""The Equator Principles, as a voluntary set of principles, cannot depend solely on peer group pressure to succeed. Independent monitoring and compliance mechanisms must be put in place. Signatories cannot expect to receive much public credit without accountability procedures that ensure that banks practice what they preach on the ground"". Said Andreas Missbach of Berne Declaration: ""Signing on to the Equator Principles must signify an end to 'business as usual' for banks, reflected in a change in their portfolios and lending practices. EP banks should invest in, and capitalise on the potential good will created by the EPs. Any short term financial gains from signing on to a controversial project such as BTC will be insignificant compared to this future asset"". "
